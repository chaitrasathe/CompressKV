It is always like this\r\nHenry: maybe you are right\r\nJill: yeah I am, we always postpone this and promise each other we will do it later and then we wake up in november and nothing is available anymore\r\nHenry: i guess so, were you thinking of going abroad this year?\r\nJill: nope, i would like to do it on a low budget, good old mountains will be great\r\nHenry: did you already talk to everyone involved?\r\nJill: not yet but I am sure everyone will be on board, maybe except Tom\r\nHenry: why?\r\nJill: he will probably want to go somewhere with Caroline and spend it alone ;)\r\nHenry: ah ye, hahaha, we rarely see him anymore ;)\r\nJill: <file_gif>\r\nHenry: exactly! :P\nSummary: It was always too late to book something good for New Year's Eve, so this year Jill starts looking in June.

So terrible for you.\r\nKate: One learns to cope. Rough time though.\r\nBenny: I know what you mean.\r\nHelen: Something recent?\r\nBenny: In particular, one close friend Rob that I visit, had a stroke 7 weeks ago, and although showing signs of still \u201cbeing in there\u201d like smiling and squeezing hands, has not spoken or communicated in 7 weeks.\r\nHelen: My dad had recovered after a stroke his understanding and learnt to communicate with us but never regained his power of speech.\r\nBenny: We are not sure how much Rob really understands.
