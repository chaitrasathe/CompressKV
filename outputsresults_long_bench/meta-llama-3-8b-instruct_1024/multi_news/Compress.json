The Occupy Los Angeles encampment at City Hall Park is seen before the midnight deadline for eviction from City Hall Park passes in Los Angeles, November 27, 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Police in riot gear closed in before dawn on Monday on anti-Wall Street activists in Los Angeles who defied a midnight deadline to vacate a camp outside City Hall, but stopped short of clearing the encampment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police managed to reopen blocked streets for morning rush-hour commuters after a tense standoff with protesters who had taken over a downtown intersection, but remnants of a crowd that had swelled to 2,000 overnight remained at City Hall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four demonstrators were arrested during the brief confrontation, accused of being present at an unlawful assembly, before police ultimately pulled back from City Hall park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later, attorneys for Occupy LA asked a federal judge for an injunction barring police from evicting the camp, arguing that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and police chief Charlie Beck had violated their civil rights by ordering it dismantled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Los Angeles encampment, which officials had tolerated for weeks even as other cities moved in to clear out similar camps, is among the largest on the West Coast aligned with a 2-month-old national Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Villaraigosa eventually gave protesters until just after midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal, setting the stage for the latest showdown between leaders of a major U.S. city and the Occupy movement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But about two hours after the eviction deadline had passed, police commanders said they would permit the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak. Police Commander Andrew Smith later said he thought it was \"highly unlikely\" that the camp would be forced to shut down on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elsewhere in the country, a 5 p.m. Sunday deadline set by Philadelphia officials for Occupy protesters there to move from a similar encampment came and went without incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dozens of people heeded the order but many tents and other structures stayed put. Police sources said authorities were hoping the rest of the protesters would relocate voluntarily and that no major actions were expected before Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WHOSE STREET? OUR STREET!' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Staking its place since October 1 on the grounds surrounding City Hall, the Los Angeles camp had grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, organizers and municipal officials said. At least a third of campers were believed to be homeless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Sunday night the size of the crowd outside City Hall swelled further as supporters from organized labor, clergy, civil rights and other groups streamed into the area, answering a call for an 11th-hour show of support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The overall number of protesters, some wearing gas masks, had grown to at least 2,000 by late Sunday, police estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After keeping out of sight throughout the day on Sunday, police began to make their presence known as the mayor's eviction deadline passed, and the protesters' mood turned from calm and festive to rowdy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Demonstrators and police confronted each other overnight but except for some debris thrown by protesters at one point, there was no violence. One skirmish involved an intersection occupied by protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Minutes after ordering protesters in the street to disperse, dozens of helmeted police carrying night sticks and special shotguns for firing \"bean-bag\" projectiles enclosed the intersection and forced their way into the crowd. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most in the crowd quickly retreated into the park, as onlookers chanted \"Whose street? Our Street\" at police and shouted at those defying police to \"Get off the street!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Someone hurled what appeared to be pieces of a bamboo pole and a bottle at police, and Smith said four people were arrested. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Los Angeles has been relatively accommodating to its Occupy group compared to other major cities, with Villaraigosa at one point providing ponchos to campers when it rained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But after the collapse of negotiations aimed at persuading protesters to relocate voluntarily, the mayor said last week the encampment would have to go. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mayor complimented the protesters on Sunday for staying peaceful. But he added in a statement: \"It is time for Occupy LA to move from focusing their efforts to hold a particular patch of park land to spreading the message of economic justice and restoration of balance to American society.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he hoped to avoid the sporadic violence that erupted in other cities when police used force against Occupy protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A number of protesters early on Monday credited the police with showing restraint, including Clark Davis, an Occupy LA organizer, who said to Smith and a group of other officers standing by, \"You guys have been fantastic.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Writing by Steve Gorman and Dan Whitcomb; Additional reporting by Lucy Nicholson and Dave Warner in Philadelphia; Editing by Greg McCune and Cynthia Johnston)\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nMembers of Occupy Philadelphia remain on site at City Hall into the evening of Nov. 28.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.\nPassage 2:\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kalashnikov designed the AK-47 after being wounded fighting for the Red Army NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The inventor of the Kalashnikov assault rifle apparently wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church before he died expressing fears he was morally responsible for the people it killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died last month aged 94, wrote a long emotional letter to Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Devilish desires' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis The letter published by Izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created Russia's most famous weapon. Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine. It's unclear, though, how much of this he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a letter, published in Russia's pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, he wrote: \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths?\" he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The longer I live,\" he continued, \"the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter is typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, and is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kalashnikov, or AK-47, is one of the world's most familiar and widely used weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is thought that more than 100 million Kalashnikov rifles have been sold worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov refused to accept responsibility for the many people killed by his weapon, blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin attended Kalashnikov's funeral in December NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, pride in his invention was tempered with sadness at its use by criminals and child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is painful for me to see when criminal elements of all kinds fire from my weapon,\" Kalashnikov said in 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia Cyril Alexander Volkov, Press secretary for Russian Patriarch Kirill NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defend his country NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his letter to Patriarch Kirill, Kalashnikov said that he first went into a church at the age of 91 and was later baptised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says it is unclear how much of it he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The press secretary for the Russian Patriarch, Cyril Alexander Volkov, told the paper the religious leader had received Kalashnikov's letter and had written a reply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,\" Mr Volkov was quoted as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov received many Russian state honours, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour, but made little money from his gun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He died on 23 December after being admitted to hospital a month earlier with internal bleeding.\nPassage 3:\nIn this Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2009 file photo Mikhail Kalashnikov, who invented the AK-47 assault rifle, attends festivities to celebrate his 90th birthday at the Kremlin in Moscow. (AP Photo/Natalia Kolesnikova, Pool, file) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, designer of the legendary AK-47 assault rifle, turned to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church shortly before his death to express fears he was personally guilty for those it killed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died last month aged 94, wrote a long emotional letter to Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Devilish desires' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis The letter published by Izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created Russia's most famous weapon. Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine. It's unclear, though, how much of this he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a letter, published in Russia's pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, he wrote: \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths?\" he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The longer I live,\" he continued, \"the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter is typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, and is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kalashnikov, or AK-47, is one of the world's most familiar and widely used weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is thought that more than 100 million Kalashnikov rifles have been sold worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov refused to accept responsibility for the many people killed by his weapon, blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin attended Kalashnikov's funeral in December NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, pride in his invention was tempered with sadness at its use by criminals and child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is painful for me to see when criminal elements of all kinds fire from my weapon,\" Kalashnikov said in 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia Cyril Alexander Volkov, Press secretary for Russian Patriarch Kirill NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defend his country NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his letter to Patriarch Kirill, Kalashnikov said that he first went into a church at the age of 91 and was later baptised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says it is unclear how much of it he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The press secretary for the Russian Patriarch, Cyril Alexander Volkov, told the paper the religious leader had received Kalashnikov's letter and had written a reply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,\" Mr Volkov was quoted as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov received many Russian state honours, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour, but made little money from his gun.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply\u2014one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "pred": " Write a one-page summary of all the news.

Hernandez, 39, was shot... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would be 33 minutes before Transportation Security Administration Officer Gerardo Hernandez, who was about 20 feet from an exit, would be wheeled out by police to an ambulance, said the officials, who were briefed on the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe was still ongoing into the Nov. 1 shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all but five of those minutes, there was no threat from the suspected gunman _ he had been shot and was in custody, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it's not known when Hernandez died or if immediate medical attention could have saved his life, officials are examining what conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier, one of the officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Formal conclusions may take months to reach, but what's known raises the possibility that a lack of coordination between police and fire officials prevented speedy treatment for Hernandez and other victims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TSA workers at LAX have been wondering the same thing, said Victor Payes, who works at the airport and is president of the local union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that shouldn't have happened,\" Payes said. \"We may be talking about Officer Hernandez as a survivor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives for the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Los Angeles Airport Police said they couldn't comment on the ongoing investigation until extensive reports are finished.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say that Paul Ciancia entered Terminal 3 with a duffel bag, pulled out an assault rifle and started shooting. They said he had a note in his bag that said he wanted to \"kill TSA\" and that he wanted to stir fear in them, criticizing their searches as unconstitutional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was shot by airport police officers four times, in the mouth and leg, before being taken into custody. He remains in fair condition at a hospital and his doctors will determine when he's fit to appear in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the chaotic moments after the gunfire began, as travelers dove to the ground or scrambled for cover in restaurants and stores, officials worried there could be bombs in the terminal and tried to determine whether the gunman had any accomplices. In the first 30 minutes, there was also an unfounded report of two suspicious people on an adjacent parking garage roof, one of the officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officers from multiple agencies bent down to check on Hernandez before moving on, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police broadcast over their radios that Ciancia was in custody at 9:25 a.m., five minutes after Hernandez was shot in the chest. That's when a nearly 26-year veteran Los Angeles police officer checked on Hernandez several times, repeatedly telling officers who came by from various agencies \"he's dead,\" according to one of the law enforcement officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's unclear whether the officer was qualified to determine Hernandez was dead. No officers rendered first aid on scene, according to surveillance video reviewed by the officials. Finally, airport police put Hernandez in a wheelchair and ran him to an ambulance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trauma surgeon David Plurad said Hernandez had no signs of life when he arrived at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Doctors worked for about an hour to revive him despite significant blood loss.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers is seeking to recover about $973,000 in costs from a high profile gender discrimination trial that captivated Silicon Valley, according to a court filing on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ellen Pao leaves San Francisco Superior Court Civic Center Courthouse during a lunch break in San Francisco, California March 25, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A jury cleared Kleiner Perkins in March of claims it short-circuited former partner Ellen Pao\u2019s career because she is a woman. The trial helped spark a wide discussion about gender at the center of the U.S. technology industry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner has offered to waive its legal costs should Pao choose not to appeal, according to firm spokeswoman Christina Lee. Kleiner\u2019s costs request includes about $865,000 in expert witness fees, the court filing said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation,\u201d Lee said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao and her legal team are considering the proposal, said Heather Wilson, a spokeswoman for Pao. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao, now interim chief executive at social-news service Reddit, claimed her standing at Kleiner Perkins crumbled after she ended a brief affair with a partner. Her career deteriorated after he and Kleiner Perkins started retaliating against her in a climate that was overall unfriendly toward women, her lawyers argued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the verdict, three jurors told Reuters they had focused on Pao\u2019s increasingly negative performance reviews, which undermined her argument that she deserved to be promoted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner\u2019s offer to withdraw its costs request in exchange for an end to the case, is common when defendants prevail in employment lawsuits. Should Pao decide to pursue an appeal, her case would be heard by California\u2019s First District Court of Appeal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Westlaw data, out of 49 decisions involving discrimination and retaliation over the past two years, the First District affirmed 26 of 31 cases where the employer won in the trial court, or 84 percent. Only five cases were reversed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile the court, which covers San Francisco and 11 other Northern California counties, handed victory to employers in more than half of the cases they lost in the lower courts, reversing 10 of 18 cases.\nPassage 2:\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm, is offering a new deal to the former associate who unsuccessfully sued the firm, accusing it of gender discrimination: Promise not to pursue this case any further or pay us $1 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The offer was made in papers filed this week in California Superior Court in San Francisco.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nSycamore, Illinois (CNN) The man convicted in the oldest cold case ever brought to court broke into a wide grin as a judge ordered him released from prison Friday and granted him a new trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack McCullough, 76, was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the judge's ruling, McCullough turned toward his stepdaughter, Janey O'Connor, and flashed her a private signal that she says means \"I love you.\" She was seated behind him and broke into tears but managed a big smile back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria Ridulph's murder went unsolved for half a century. Then detectives pursued a tip, and a man was brought to trial and convicted in the 1957 murder of the 7-year-old in Sycamore, Illinois. Now that man is free. Ann O'Neill's 2013 series on the case, \"Taken,\" raised questions about whether the trial was unfairly one-sided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across the aisle, Charles Ridulph, the older brother of the victim, frowned and bowed his head. More than 58 years ago, he helped search for Maria after she vanished from a street corner near their home while playing in the snow with a friend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough has long insisted that he couldn't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He repeated the alibi when he spoke with CNN in prison in March 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They proved nothing,\" he said at the time. \"I am in here for murder. A murder I would not, could not have done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough said that when Maria was kidnapped, the telephone in his home in Sycamore was ringing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And I was on the other end of that phone, in Rockford, three minutes before she was kidnapped. Try and make that happen. Only Scotty could make that happen, if he beamed me up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack McCullough, in prison after his 2012 conviction. Now a judge has ordered him freed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Illinois appeals court upheld his conviction last year. But McCullough made a last-ditch appeal in a jailhouse motion last December, saying police and prosecutors buried evidence supporting his alibi. He asked a judge to find him innocent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who inherited the case from predecessor Clay Campbell, was placed in the position of having to defend the conviction. He launched a six-month investigation that included a review of some 4,500 pages of documents -- old police and FBI reports, grand jury transcripts, trial transcripts, affidavits for search and arrest warrants, and even CNN's five-part series on the case, \"Taken,\" which raised questions about whether the courtroom reconstruction of history was unfairly one-sided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack concluded that he'd found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough had been convicted of a crime he didn't commit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The precise time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUST WATCHED Taken: The coldest case ever solved Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Taken: The coldest case ever solved 02:18 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dark-haired second-grader with big brown eyes was with her playmate, Kathy Sigman, on December 3, 1957 when they were approached by a stranger who said his name was Johnny. He gave Maria two piggyback rides, Sigman told police at the time. Sigman, now a grandmother known as Kathy Chapman, said she went home to fetch her mittens. When she returned, Maria and Johnny were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 600 volunteers combed the fields and woods around Sycamore in search of Maria, at times walking hand-in-hand in a grid pattern. And within 24 hours, dozens of FBI agents descended on the small farming community about 65 miles west of Chicago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Agents interviewed some 200 possible suspects -- including McCullough, who passed a polygraph test about his alibi and was cleared. Despite the work of nearly three-dozen FBI agents, the investigation turned up no solid leads to Maria's whereabouts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her body was discovered 144 days later by a couple looking for mushrooms near the Iowa border. She was under a fallen tree, some 100 miles from home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because Maria apparently never left Illinois, the FBI pulled out of the investigation and the case went cold for half a century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Illinois State Police began to look into the Ridulph case again in 2008, after McCullough's half sister, Janet Tessier, emailed a tip. She said her dying mother had pulled her close some 14 years earlier and whispered, \"Those two little girls, and the one that disappeared, John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough was questioned in Seattle and arrested in late June 2011. A judge hearing the case without a jury found McCullough guilty after a week-long trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, the state's attorney, said he sat through the trial and always doubted whether there was enough evidence to support the conviction. In his review of the case, he said he found new evidence that verified McCullough's long-standing alibi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He subpoenaed records from AT&T and found that a collect call had indeed been placed at 6:57 p.m. to McCullough's home in Sycamore from a pay phone at the post office in downtown Rockford on on December 3, 1957 -- just as McCullough said he had done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At his sentencing, McCullough vehemently professed his innocence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Look in the box. The truth is in the box,\" he said, pointing to a cardboard box in the courtroom. It was filled with old FBI reports and other documents that the judge, James Hallock, kept from the trial, saying it was inadmissible hearsay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutor Richard Schmack reviewed the case and asked for McCullough to go free. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack did look at those documents. He built a timeline based on the statements of 21 people -- Maria Ridulph's family members, friends, neighbors and passersby -- that confirmed the FBI's original timeline ruling out McCullough as a suspect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria was taken that day some time between 6:45 and 7 p.m. -- and not as early as 6 p.m., as alleged during McCullough's trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would have been impossible for him to have been in two places at once. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Campbell, the state's attorney who brought the case, was defeated by Schmack in an election just weeks after McCullough was convicted. Campbell has declined to comment since Schmack released his findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cold cases are particularly difficult to prosecute because evidence is often lost or destroyed, memories fade and witnesses die. And so questions have lingered over the evidence used to convict McCullough -- and whether it was strong enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No physical evidence ties him to the crime.\nPassage 2:\nSYCAMORE, Ill. --A 76-year-old man from Washington state who a prosecutor says was wrongly convicted in the abduction and killing of a 7-year-old Illinois schoolgirl in 1957 will be released from prison, a judge ordered Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WATCH: \"48 Hours:\" Cold as Ice NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing, presided over by Judge William P. Brady, was held in Sycamore, about 70 miles west of Chicago and near where Maria Ridulph was abducted as she played in the snow. Forest hikers found the girl's remains five months later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012, another judge convicted Jack McCullough in Maria's death, in one of the oldest unsolved U.S. cases ever to go to trial. McCullough was sentenced to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough, in handcuffs, appeared shaken by the judge's decision at first, rocking back and forth, then taking a deep breath. Family members behind him hugged and cried. Moments later, McCullough looked back and smiled broadly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the other side of the room, Maria's brother and sister displayed little emotion as the hearing ended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady said McCullough would be released Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge pointed to several factors in his decision, including records that support McCullough's long-held contention that he was about 40 miles away from Sycamore when Maria was abducted. That evidence included newly discovered phone records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn't clear until the last minute the Brady would rule as he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Rest assured I am not trying this case ... You will not hear the words, 'Mr. McCullough is guilty' or 'Mr. McCullough is not guilty' coming from my mouth.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady's ruling was prompted by a six-month review of evidence conducted by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack after the 2012 conviction. Schmack concluded that McCullough could not have killed Maria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's disappearance made headlines nationwide in the 1950s, when reports of child abductions were rare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had been playing outside in the snow with a friend on Dec. 3, 1957, when a young man approached, introduced himself as \"Johnny\" and offered them piggyback rides. Maria's friend dashed home to grab mittens, and when she came back, Maria and the man were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At trial, prosecutors said McCullough was Johnny, because he went by John Tessier in his youth. They said McCullough, then 18, dragged Maria away, choked and stabbed her to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who wasn't involved in McCullough's case and was elected to the state's attorney post as McCullough's trial came to an end, filed a scathing report with the court last month that appeared to pick the case apart, point-by-point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's long-held alibi was that he was in Rockford, attempting to enlist with the U.S. Air Force at a military recruiting station, on the night Maria disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack said newly discovered phone records proved McCullough had, as he long-claimed, made a collect call to his parents at 6:57 p.m. from a phone booth in downtown Rockford - which is 40 miles northwest of where Maria was abducted between 6:45 p.m. and 6:55 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack also reviewed police reports and hundreds of other documents, including from the Air Force recruitment office, which he said had been improperly barred at trial. In his review he said the documents contained \"a wealth of information pointing to McCullough's innocence, and absolutely nothing showing guilt.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also noted that Maria's friend had identified McCullough as the killer five decades later from an array of six photographs; McCullough's picture stood out, partially because everyone but him wore suitcoats and their photos were professional yearbook pictures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's murder haunted the Sycamore for decades, and McCullough's conviction four years ago seemed to bring some closure. Those wounds now threaten to reopen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her family remains convinced that McCullough is guilty and have sought the appointment of a special prosecutor in an attempt to keep him behind bars. Maria's brother, 70-year-old Charles Ridulph, still lives in Sycamore and has said in recent weeks that his family feels let down by the state prosecutor's office about-face.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSycamore, Illinois (CNN) The man convicted in the oldest cold case ever brought to court broke into a wide grin as a judge ordered him released from prison Friday and granted him a new trial.

He built a timeline based on the statements of 21 people -- Maria Ridulph's family members, friends, neighbors and passersby -- that confirmed the FBI's original timeline ruling out McCullough as a suspect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria was taken that day some time between 6:45 and 7 p.m. -- and not as early as 6 p.m., as alleged during McCullough's trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would have been impossible for him to have been in two places at once. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Campbell, the state's attorney who brought the case, was defeated by Schmack in an election just weeks after McCullough was convicted. Campbell has declined to comment since Schmack released his findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cold cases are particularly difficult to prosecute because evidence is often lost or destroyed, memories fade and witnesses die. And so questions have lingered over the evidence used to convict McCullough -- and whether it was strong enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No physical evidence ties him to the crime.\nPassage 2:\nSYCAMORE, Ill. --A 76-year-old man from Washington state who a prosecutor says was wrongly convicted in the abduction and killing of a 7-year-old Illinois schoolgirl in 1957 will be released from prison, a judge ordered Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WATCH: \"48 Hours:\" Cold as Ice NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing, presided over by Judge William P. Brady, was held in Sycamore, about 70 miles west of Chicago and near where Maria Ridulph was abducted as she played in the snow. Forest hikers found the girl's remains five months later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012, another judge convicted Jack McCullough in Maria's death, in one of the oldest unsolved U.S. cases ever to go to trial. McCullough was sentenced to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough, in handcuffs, appeared shaken by the judge's decision at first, rocking back and forth, then taking a deep breath. Family members behind him hugged and cried. Moments later, McCullough looked back and smiled broadly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the other side of the room, Maria's brother and sister displayed little emotion as the hearing ended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady said McCullough would be released Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge pointed to several factors in his decision, including records that support McCullough's long-held contention that he was about 40 miles away from Sycamore when Maria was abducted. That evidence included newly discovered phone records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn't clear until the last minute the Brady would rule as he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Rest assured I am not trying this case ... You will not hear the words, 'Mr. McCullough is guilty' or 'Mr. McCullough is not guilty' coming from my mouth.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady's ruling was prompted by a six-month review of evidence conducted by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack after the 2012 conviction. Schmack concluded that McCullough could not have killed Maria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's disappearance made headlines nationwide in the 1950s, when reports of child abductions were rare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had been playing outside in the snow with a friend on Dec. 3, 1957, when a young man approached, introduced himself as \"Johnny\" and offered them piggyback rides. Maria's friend dashed home to grab mittens, and when she came back, Maria and the man were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At trial, prosecutors said McCullough was Johnny, because he went by John Tessier in his youth. They said McCullough, then 18, dragged Maria away, choked and stabbed her to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who wasn't involved in McCullough's case and was elected to the state's attorney post as McCullough's trial came to an end, filed a scathing report with the court last month that appeared to pick the case apart, point-by-point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's long-held alibi was that he was in Rockford, attempting to enlist with the U.S. Air Force at a military recruiting station, on the night Maria disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack said newly discovered phone records proved McCullough had, as he long-claimed, made a collect call to his parents at 6:57 p.m. from a phone booth in downtown Rockford - which is 40 miles northwest of where Maria was abducted between 6:45 p.m. and 6:55 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack also reviewed police reports and hundreds of other documents, including from the Air Force recruitment office, which he said had been improperly barred at trial. In his review he said the documents contained \"a wealth of information pointing to McCullough's innocence, and absolutely nothing showing guilt.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also noted that Maria's friend had identified McCullough as the killer five decades later from an array of six photographs; McCullough's picture stood out, partially because everyone but him wore suitcoats and their photos were professional yearbook pictures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's murder haunted the Sycamore for decades, and McCullough's conviction four years ago seemed to bring some closure. Those wounds now threaten to reopen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her family remains convinced that McCullough is guilty and have sought the appointment of a special prosecutor in an attempt to keep him behind bars. Maria's brother, 70-year-old Charles Ridulph, still lives in Sycamore and has said in recent weeks that his family feels let down by the state prosecutor's office about-face.\n", "answers": ["A man convicted four years ago in the oldest cold case ever tried was freed Friday after an Illinois judge vacated his conviction and subsequent life sentence, CNN reports. According to CBS News, 76-year-old Jack McCullough was convicted of kidnapping a 7-year-old girl, choking her, and stabbing her to death in 1957. The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent. While the judge Friday vacated McCullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the Chicago Tribune reports. McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents\u2014including phone and Air Force records\u2014supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened. But his was the only non-yearbook photo in the lineup, and she picked a different man out of a photo lineup 50 years earlier. That info wasn't allowed at McCullough's trial either. No physical evidence was ever found to support McCullough's conviction."], "pred": " Write a one-page summary of all the news. Write a one-page summary of all the news.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jonathan Ernst/Reuters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat\u2019s really why I\u2019m here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI can never forget what Jon Tester did to a man of the highest quality.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThey wanted that caravan and there are those who say that caravan didn\u2019t just happen, it didn\u2019t just happen. A lot of reasons that caravan -- 4,000 people -- but I just want to thank the Mexican government because they\u2019re stopping it hopefully before it ever gets to Mexico,\u201d Trump said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAs you know, I\u2019m willing to send the military to defend our Southern border if necessary all because of the illegal immigration onslaught brought by the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or to change the laws -- they like it,\u201d Trump said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said that the midterm elections will be \u201can election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense -- that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jonathan Ernst/Reuters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At times, the president veered off script, talking about the first lady\u2019s trip to Africa and controversy over her pith hat (\u201cI think she bought it in Los Angeles!\u201d) and fake allegations he wears a toupee (\u201cHe wears a hairpiece\u201d). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then he would swerve back on course to talking about Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA test in a state home to many Indian reservations: \u201cIt\u2019s too bad because I can\u2019t call her Pocahontas anymore.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Trump comfortably won the Big Sky state by 20 points, Tester, a moderate Democrat, maintains a slight lead in what has become one of the most expensive political contests in the small state\u2019s history as millions of dollars have poured into Montana. It\u2019s the president\u2019s third trip to Montana, and Tester is only a few points ahead of Rosendale in recent polls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tester has touted a bipartisan record in the Senate, even publishing a full-page newspaper ad at the beginning of the summer thanking the president for signing 16 of his bills into law on everything from government waste to veterans affairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe can\u2019t let Jon Tester and the radical liberal agenda win, they\u2019ll go after President Trump,\u201d Rosendale said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the president\u2019s ire toward Tester is rooted in Jackson, many of the voters ABC News spoke with before the rally began didn't seem to know his name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI really don\u2019t have any thoughts about him,\u201d Jeffrey Stenger from Polson, Montana, told ABC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His wife Lynn jumped in, to remind him he was the White House physician who \u201cgot in a spat with Tester.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe has a good instinct of reading people, even in the beginning of the election he called people out and said the truth.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nCigarette smoke has long been known to have a multitude of damaging effects, but thanks to recent research we now know it also fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs. According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia. Originating as a strain of staph infection, MRSA becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. A disastrous diagnosis due to its innate difficulty to treat, it has become even more threatening with the addition of smoking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, in a press release. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist, sought to find potential ties between the increased occurrences of MRSA cases in smokers. In order to do so, Crotty Alexander and her team tested two groups of MRSA, one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not, to see how each group responded to the defenses of our immune system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Macrophages, or immune cells known to devour infectious ages, were infected with both types of MRSA (smoke exposed and not) to test the immune response. Although both were able to take up the populations of MRSA, macrophages fighting MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time killing them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers found that this type of MRSA was more resistant to the reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst macrophages utilize once they have engulfed bacteria. MRSA exposed to smoke extract was also more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense used to make holes in bacteria and cause inflammation. Even more alarming was researchers\u2019 discovery that MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, assisting in the success of their invasion. This effect depended strongly on dose; the more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ultimately, the data suggest that through altering the cell walls of the bacteria, cigarette smoke allows MRSA to repel common forms of immune responses. Another study conducted by researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier suggested something similar with e-cigarette smoke; vaporized smoke can also alter the structure of MRSA\u2019s cell wall to make it more resistant to bacteria. However, this research also discovered that surface changes to the bacteria increased 10 times more with exposure to cigarette smoke rather than e-cigarette vapor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Now we have evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor,\" Crotty Alexander said. Through their finding, Crotty Alexander and her team hope to add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract become harder to kill, said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crotty Alexander is senior author of the paper, published Monday in the journal Infection and Immunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study is similar to one published last May, in which the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance was examined.

Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. \u2014 Hayne Palmour IV NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, Crotty Alexander said. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MRSA exposed to the smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, Crotty's team found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worse, the study found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions. At that rate, a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When we put these cigarette smoke-exposed bacteria into mice, there was a significant difference in mortality,\" compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed, Crotty Alexander said in a phone interview Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The smoke-exposed MRSA also became better at invading human cells in lab cultures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The cigarette smoke helped the bacteria kill more mice, whereas the e-cigarette vapor was just on the borderline,\" Crotty Alexander said. \"It did make it a little more aggressive, but not as much as the cigarette smoke.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. \u2014 NIAID Share Photo \uf610 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \uf611 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reddit NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2709 Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. / NIAID NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study stated it was performed to examine an alternative to the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker. The alternative is that smoke actually makes the pathogen tougher. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for that alternative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Because MRSA causes severe pneumonia more often than MSSA, and because MRSA commonly colonizes the nasopharynx and airways and thus is exposed to inhaled substances, we examined the effect of cigarette smoke on MRSA resistance to host innate immune killing mechanisms and the ability to cause pneumonia in mice,\" the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests on human cells found the same result, Crotty Alexander said. Previous research has shown that cigarette smoke harms human respiratory and immune cells, she said.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nThe most important person in the English-language world is Frank Sinatra, according to an analysis of Wikipedia articles led by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Number two is Michael Jackson, and number three is Pope Pius XII. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eom arrived at this somewhat surprising conclusion by using methods borrowed from Google to analyse Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taking all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia into account, Eom's team carried out the same study and came to a more plausible conclusion: Adolf Hitler. (Even then, Michael Jackson takes the second slot, and Madonna is in third place.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The point of the study wasn't strictly to determine who the most important people are on Wikipedia, but instead to discover if the online encyclopaedia was skewed in the level of attention it gives to various figures, either by gender, time, or location. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our analysis shows that most important historical \ufb01gures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. But, they add, \"each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so that most of its own historical figures are born in the countries which use the language of the edition. The emergence of such pronounced accent to local figures seems to be natural since there are more links and interactions within one culture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study takes as its starting point Google's PageRank algorithm. This is still the basic method the search engine uses to decide the basic importance of webpages in its index, although the system has received an almost total overhaul since it was first introduced in 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PageRank says that a page is important if a lot of important pages link to it. While the definition sounds self-referential, in practice, it recreates a lot of features which we intuitively understand: the more sites link to a newspaper's website, for instance, the more important that website is; and being linked to from a national newspaper probably says more about a site's importance than being linked to from a nondescript blog. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But when the study applied PageRank to figures on Wikipedia, the results were odd. The most important person in the world comes out as Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist \u2013 certainly an important feature in natural history, but possibly not the most important in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It seems the algorithm was thrown by a quirk of Wikipedia: the site contains an almost complete collection of named species \u2013 as well as who named them. Since Linnaeus' life work was coming up with a system to classify organisms, and applying that system as widely as possible, he is linked to from a lot of pages, and important ones at that. From the Domestic Cat to the Red Fox, through the mighty Asian elephant and the lowly moss gall, Linnaeus named, and is linked from, them all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To get around that issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance: CheiRank. Simply put, \"the PageRank\u2026 of an article is proportional to the number of incoming links, while the CheiRank\u2026 of an article is proportional to the number of outgoing links. Thus a top PageRank article is important since other articles refer to it, while a top CheiRank article is highly connected because it refers to other articles.\" In other words, an important person is likely to have a lot of other important people and things involved in their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mix Pagerank and CheiRank together, and you get the final measure: 2DRank. That's how the authors arrived at the top 100 for all 24 editions of Wikipedia \u2013 and how Frank Sinatra took pole position.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Number two is Michael Jackson, and number three is Pope Pius XII. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eom arrived at this somewhat surprising conclusion by using methods borrowed from Google to analyse Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taking all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia into account, Eom's team carried out the same study and came to a more plausible conclusion: Adolf Hitler. (Even then, Michael Jackson takes the second slot, and Madonna is in third place.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The point of the study wasn't strictly to determine who the most important people are on Wikipedia, but instead to discover if the online encyclopaedia was skewed in the level of attention it gives to various figures, either by gender, time, or location. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our analysis shows that most important historical \ufb01gures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. But, they add, \"each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so that most of its own historical figures are born in the countries which use the language of the edition. The emergence of such pronounced accent to local figures seems to be natural since there are more links and interactions within one culture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study takes as its starting point Google's PageRank algorithm. This is still the basic method the search engine uses to decide the basic importance of webpages in its index, although the system has received an almost total overhaul since it was first introduced in 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PageRank says that a page is important if a lot of important pages link to it. While the definition sounds self-referential, in practice, it recreates a lot of features which we intuitively understand: the more sites link to a newspaper's website, for instance, the more important that website is; and being linked to from a national newspaper probably says more about a site's importance than being linked to from a nondescript blog. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But when the study applied PageRank to figures on Wikipedia, the results were odd. The most important person in the world comes out as Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist \u2013 certainly an important feature in natural history, but possibly not the most important in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It seems the algorithm was thrown by a quirk of Wikipedia: the site contains an almost complete collection of named species \u2013 as well as who named them. Since Linnaeus' life work was coming up with a system to classify organisms, and applying that system as widely as possible, he is linked to from a lot of pages, and important ones at that. From the Domestic Cat to the Red Fox, through the mighty Asian elephant and the lowly moss gall, Linnaeus named, and is linked from, them all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To get around that issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance: CheiRank. Simply put, \"the PageRank\u2026 of an article is proportional to the number of incoming links, while the CheiRank\u2026 of an article is proportional to the number of outgoing links. Thus a top PageRank article is important since other articles refer to it, while a top CheiRank article is highly connected because it refers to other articles.\" In other words, an important person is likely to have a lot of other important people and things involved in their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mix Pagerank and CheiRank together, and you get the final measure: 2DRank. That's how the authors arrived at the top 100 for all 24 editions of Wikipedia \u2013 and how Frank Sinatra took pole position.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason for always-on listening mode is simple; Microsoft wants the new Xbox to respond quickly and naturally to you, whenever you need it. To fulfill that goal, the company will ship the new Kinect \u2014 its motion-sensing and listening peripheral \u2014 with every Xbox One. The new console uses the new Kinect for just about everything: switching between games, movies, web browsing, and live television, all of which can be done with voice commands. (In fact, the new console needs the Kinect to operate at all \u2014 it's not an optional add-on like with the Xbox 360.) Even when the console's turned off, users can simply say \"Xbox On\" to power up \u2014 which means the new Kinect will be listening to you in your living room at all times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I think it's creepy that you can say \"Xbox on\" and it will turn on. It means it's always listening to you. \u2014 Jack Lloyd (@RedDeadLloyd) May 21, 2013 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kinect on the Xbox One is always listening/watching and has a constant connection to the Internet. 1984 anyone? \u2014 James Philippon (@jamesphilippon) May 21, 2013 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, the new camera and microphone system is so sensitive to your presence, that Microsoft says the new Kinect can even read your heartbeat while you're exercising, and recognize and process audio that's personalized to specific individuals. \"This is rocket science level stuff,\" Xbox's Marc Whitten said during today's reveal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft claims the new Kinect is so sensitive that it can read your heartbeat and recognize individual voices NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, that's not necessarily a gloom-and-doom situation, and listening doesn't mean recording. Still, compared to privacy concerns over a device like Google Glass, which doesn't actively listen to its surroundings at all times, the new Xbox could pose greater privacy implications \u2014 especially if the system, which many users will connect to the internet, is compromised remotely by a malicious actor. \"If I'm recording you, I have to stare at you \u2014 as a human being,\" Google Glass engineer Charles Mendis told The Verge when asked about Glass' privacy concerns. \"And when someone is staring at you, you have to notice.\" But will you notice a fixed camera in your living room that's always listening? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't the first time Kinect has faced privacy concerns NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't the first time Microsoft has dealt with privacy issues related to Kinect. When the first iteration of Kinect headed to the market in 2010, Microsoft's Dennis Durken suggested to investors that the peripheral might pass data to advertisers about how you look, play, and speak. \"We can cater what content gets presented to you based on who you are,\" he said, sparking privacy concerns. (Microsoft later denied that the Kinect would use information for targeted advertising.) But even then, the first Kinect was only enabled in specific situations, and didn't have an always-on listening mode. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft provided few additional details on how the new Kinect will work, but the company did mention that the system will run in an extremely low-power state for listening mode, meaning that the device's operating system and certain hardware features could be disabled in that state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We've asked Microsoft to clarify the technical specifics of how the system operates in listening mode, and if the company has considered any safeguards against potential privacy threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: A Microsoft spokesperson responded to our inquiry with the following statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new Kinect is listening for a specific cue, like \u2018Xbox on.\u2019 We know our customers want and expect strong privacy protections to be built into our products, devices and services, and for companies to be responsible stewards of their data. Microsoft has more than ten years of experience making privacy a top priority. Kinect for Xbox 360 was designed and built with strong privacy protections in place and the new Kinect will continue this commitment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update 2: Microsoft CVP Phil Harrison told Eurogamer that the company has no plans to spy on you:\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe new privacy policy for Samsung\u2019s smart TVs allows the company and its partners to listen in on everything their users say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The policy has drawn the ire of internet users, who compared it with George Orwell\u2019s dystopian fiction 1984. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While voice recognition software almost always transmits data on what users are saying \u2014 so that the job of decoding it can be done by quicker computers elsewhere \u2014 the combination of sending the data to third-parties and the comparison with Orwell has meant that the Samsung policy has drawn particular attention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The policy states: \u201cPlease be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It makes clear that the tool can be turned off through settings, though that will stop the voice recognition working entirely and Samsung will still continue to collect data about how people use the TV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhile Samsung will not collect your spoken word, Samsung may still collect associated texts and other usage data so that we can evaluate the performance of the feature and improve it,\u201d the policy states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It bears similarities to the telescreens used in 1984, as pointed out by Twitter user and Electronic Frontier Foundation activist Parker Higgins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In that book, Orwell writes: \u201cAny sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by [the screen], moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Samsung statement said that data is encrypted to keep it safe, and that owners can disconnect the TV from wifi if they want to keep their data safe. Users can tell when the feature is activated because a microphone appears on screen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many saw the policy as a warning about the internet of things \u2014 the new trend towards internet-enabled devices in the home \u2014 which some say could allow companies to collect more data on its users than ever before.\nPassage 2:\nSamsung\u2019s SmartTV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customised TV, movie, and other content recommendations, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your SmartTV with gestures and voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your SmartTV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some SmartTV features. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recommendations and Customised Content NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Device Information NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The SmartTV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third-party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your SmartTV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your post code. In addition, the SmartTV helps make the searchable guides and other SmartTV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you, such as episodes of programs that you may have missed and new programs, applications and other content that we believe you will find of interest. We base these recommendations on: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your SmartTV or other devices; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Information about applications you have accessed through the SmartTV panels; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Information about your clicks on the \u201cLike,\u201d \u201cDislike,\u201d \u201cWatch Now,\u201d and other buttons on your SmartTV; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The query terms you enter into SmartTV search features, including when you search for particular video content; and NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other SmartTV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, information stored in cookies and similar technologies, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, if you enable the collection of information about video streams viewed on your SmartTV, we may collect that information and additional information about the network, channels, and programs that you view through the SmartTV. We will use such information to improve the recommendations that we deliver to you on the SmartTV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Please visit the \u201csettings\u201d menu of your SmartTV for choices that may be available to you if you do not wish to continue to receive personalised recommendations on your SmartTV. If you disable personalised recommendations, then the information and content displayed on your SmartTV may not be as relevant to you. Samsung may still collect information about your usage of the SmartTV for the purposes described in this Samsung Privacy Policy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Voice Recognition NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some interactive voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to a third-party service provider (currently, Nuance Communications, Inc.) that converts your interactive voice commands to text and to the extent necessary to provide the Voice Recognition features to you. In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your interactive voice commands only when you make a specific search request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use interactive voice recognition features, although you may be able to control your TV using certain predefined voice commands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the \u201csettings\u201d menu. However, this may prevent you from using some of the Voice Recognition features. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gesture Controls and Facial Recognition NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Your SmartTV is equipped with a camera that enables certain advanced features, including the ability to control and interact with your TV with gestures and to use facial recognition technology to authenticate your Samsung Account on your TV. The camera can be covered and disabled at any time, but be aware that these advanced services will not be available if the camera is disabled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gesture Control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To provide you with the ability to control your SmartTV through gestures, the camera mounted on the top of your SmartTV can recognise your movements. This enables you, for example, to move between panels and zoom in or zoom out. We record information about when and how users use gesture controls so that we can evaluate the performance of these controls and improve them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facial Recognition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The camera situated on the SmartTV also enables you to authenticate your Samsung Account or to log into certain services using facial recognition technology. You can use facial recognition instead of, or as a supplementary security measure in addition to, manually inputting your password. Once you complete the steps required to set up facial recognition, an image of your face is stored locally on your TV; it is not transmitted to Samsung. If you cancel your Samsung Account or no longer desire to use facial recognition, please visit the applicable settings menu to delete the stored image. While your image will be stored locally, Samsung may take note of the fact that you have set up the feature and collect information about when and how the feature is used so that we can evaluate the performance of this feature and improve it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fitness Services NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To provide you with personalised fitness recommendations, SmartTV services enable you to create a profile that contains certain basic information about yourself, including your height, weight and date of birth. You can delete such a profile at any time by following the directions in the service\u2019s preferences [or settings] screen.

Then take note: Your television is not only listening, it's sending your data to a third party, the Independent reports. The TV's voice-recognition software lets you give it orders, but the product's privacy policy warns that \"personal or other sensitive information ... will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.\" Samsung tells the BBC that the third party is Nuance, the company that does Samsung's speech-to-text conversion. But intellectual property lawyer Corynne McSherry says it would be nice to see that clarified in Samsung's policy, the Daily Beast reports. \"And I\u2019d definitely like to know whether my words were being transmitted in a secure form,\" she says.

That amounts to each of the 52 cheerleaders getting $2,500 per season worked and $400 per photo shoot. The settlement covers the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. New York State Sen. Diane Savino, per the New York Post, cheered the settlement, calling on the NFL to \"develop uniform rules \u2026 to ensure that all cheerleaders in every state received the employee pay and protections they deserve.\" NFL teams have sought to justify low pay for cheerleaders by saying they're independent contractors, CNN notes. In the case of the Flight Crew, Krystal C.'s suit claimed that cheerleaders were compensated $150 per game and $100 for special appearances. But, when you factor in practices and rehearsals, that pans out to $3.77 per hour. Throw in hair, makeup, and transportation expenses and \"the hourly rate goes below $1.50 an hour,\" says the cheerleaders' attorney.

(Family photos) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before dinner on July 29, 3-year-old Carter Roberts of Chesterfield, Va., seemed perfectly healthy. That evening, he vomited. When he woke up the next morning with a slight fever of 99 degrees, his mother, Robin Roberts, figured that he was coming down with a cold. The next morning, she found him collapsed on his bedroom floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cMommy,\u201d she recalls him saying. \u201cHelp me, help me.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carter could barely stand when she picked him up, and his neck was arched backward. \u201cWhat was most alarming,\u201d she said, \u201cis he had no control over his right arm whatsoever.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the hospital, Carter lost control of his right arm, then over his legs and other muscles within a few days. He now can only wiggle a toe and move the left side of his face. He has been diagnosed with a mysterious, polio-like illness called acute flaccid myelitis, a condition that seems to be surging this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Through July, 32 new cases of AFM have been confirmed across the United States this year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a sharp rise compared with last year, when just seven cases had been confirmed by that month. The numbers have risen steadily since April. In past years, most cases have occurred between August and December, with a peak in October. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan\u2019s $3 billion scientific effort aims to rid world of major diseases by end of century] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the many unanswered questions about the condition are what causes it, how best to treat it and how long the paralysis lasts. Although most cases occur in children, AFM occasionally affects adults. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC official who leads the surveillance efforts said that confirmed numbers for August will not be available until the end of this month, but the number of reports she is receiving from doctors around the country continues to rise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cCDC is looking at these trends very carefully,\u201d Manisha Patel said. \u201cWe have sent out several health alerts to states to let them know we are seeing an increase in reporting and to encourage them to communicate with doctors to report these cases in a timely fashion.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC began tracking AFM in 2014, when 121 cases were confirmed. That year, the CDC counted only children affected by the disease. Their average age was 7. Most had a fever or a respiratory illness a few days before developing paralysis. Many had to be placed on respirators. Although 85 percent of the children recovered partially, only three of them recovered fully.

It's a major improvement for someone with this polio-like illness. (Facebook/Team Braden Luke) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health officials and physicians around the country said they are concerned that the rising number of cases through July could foretell a repeat of 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou hate to be an alarmist, but there\u2019s reason to have some concern,\u201d said Avindra Nath, chief of the section of infections of the nervous system at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. \u201cWhat we don't know is where are these cases. Are they clustered? Do they all look alike? Getting more information on these cases would be helpful.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beyond saying that confirmed cases have been reported in 17 states through July, Patel declined to reveal which states have been involved. But conversations and emails with physicians around the country indicate that at least four cases have occurred in California and at least three in Massachusetts, and that others have been seen in Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York, as well as Virginia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe are definitely hearing of cases from our colleagues across the country,\u201d said Teri Schreiner, a neurologist at the University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend that\u2019s worrisome \u2026 what I'm hearing from others seems to be coming at a tempo similar to what happened in 2014.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jean-Baptiste Le Pichon of Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., said that doctors on a U.S. email list for pediatric neurologists reported five new cases of AFM in just the past few days. \u201cThere is definitely an explosion of cases,\u201d Le Pichon said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No treatment other than physical therapy has yet been shown to markedly improve outcomes, although some doctors have reported that treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), used to treat some other viral infectious diseases afflicting the nervous system, might help. It\u2019s also been suggested that Prozac could prove beneficial. The degree of paralysis in the first month has generally improved only slightly over the course of a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAfter about a year or so, what you\u2019ve got is what you\u2019ve got,\u201d said Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Case Western Reverse University in Cleveland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most perplexing is what causes the disease. The 2014 outbreak of AFM occurred at the same time as a far larger outbreak of enterovirus D68 across the United States. The vast majority of patients infected with the virus developed only a respiratory illness. Some physicians were convinced that EV-D68 was the cause, not only because both outbreaks occurred at the same time but also because of a study that identified a particular strain of EV-D68 in the airways of children with AFM. But officials at the CDC and some doctors, including Wiznitzer, insist that the cause remains unproved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far this year, no similarly widespread outbreak of EV-D68 respiratory infections has been reported, although cases of it and other enteroviruses have been seen in some areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday, Le Pichon, in Kansas City, said, \u201cI just got confirmation that we have an epidemic of enterovirus breaking out here and at least a few cases [of enterovirus] have typed positive for EV-D68.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carol Glaser, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., said: \u201cIf the theory is right that it\u2019s caused by EV-D68, which some of us believe more than others, this would be the time of year we start seeing it. It\u2019s an enterovirus, and they tend to peak in late summer and early fall.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the CDC\u2019s surveillance of AFM is less than two years old, it remains unclear if some of this year\u2019s apparent rise in confirmed cases is due simply to more doctors sending in case reports, Patel said. And Wiznitzer emphasized that with just 32 confirmed cases across the United States so far, AFM remains extremely rare NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Glaser, however, said she is convinced that the condition is new. She worked at the California Department of Public Health when, in 2012, some of the first reports of AFM anywhere in the country came in from physicians there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI was there for 15 years and talked to neurologists every single day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the fall of 2012 when the first physician called in and wanted a test for polio on one of his patients. One of my colleagues in the office chuckled and said to me, \u2018We don't have polio in the United States.\u2019 But in the next two weeks, I got two very similar phone calls. We had never had a report like that. I do think there was something new going on. Fortunately, it\u2019s still rare.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If EV-D68 does somehow cause AFM, studying the virus may lead to prevention or treatment. One glimmer of good news came from Kenneth Tyler, chair of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. He and his colleagues have been conducting experiments to infect mice with EV-D68 and have them develop loss of muscle control like that seen in AFM. He says he has submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed medical journal describing his success in doing so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The goal, he said, is to use mice to study how EV-D68 causes harm to the spinal cord and muscles, and to test potential therapies, such as IVIG. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re seeing protection with IVIG in the mouse model,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robin Roberts said she wishes more was known about the condition that has harmed her son. \u201cIn this day and age to not have information about something like this is very frustrating. There needs to be more done about it, and for more parents and doctors to know about it,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Angie Andersen said that her daughter McKenzie was sent home from the hospital twice in the first two weeks of her illness because doctors did not understand the severity of what was happening. Finally her pediatrician told Andersen to bring McKenzie to another hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McKenzie was 6 years old when she developed sniffles in December 2014. \u201cWithin 12 days,\u201d Andersen said, \u201cshe was paralyzed from the neck down, on a ventilator to breathe for her. She was left with her left hand and her feet and toes that move.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou know you could understand the bad that comes from a car wreck, or if she got cancer,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cHow do you ever wrap your brain around the fact that she got a cold, and now she\u2019s a quadriplegic on a ventilator? It\u2019s a nightmare you never wake up from.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, she said, McKenzie can now speak and even sing softly despite having a tracheotomy. \u201cShe has a lot of spunk, and that is helping her through,\u201d Andersen said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From Jan. 1 to Aug. 31, 2016, the CDC reported 50 people in 24 U.S. states had been diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), compared with only 21 people in 2015 in 16 U.S. states. From August to December 2014, 120 people, mostly patients 21 and younger, in 34 U.S. states, were diagnosed with the condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AFM affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, according to the CDC. The cause is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections like polio and non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Enteroviruses can cause neurologic illness such as meningitis, but more serious disease like encephalitis and AFM are less common. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Symptoms of AFM include pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and, most severely, respiratory failure that can occur when muscles involved in breathing become weak. The latter symptom can require urgent ventilator support, according to the CDC. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but rather neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the AFM outbreak in 2014 coincided with an outbreak of enterovirus D68, the CDC did not detect traces of the severe respiratory virus in the AFM specimens collected that year. Among the people with AFM in 2015, the CDC also did not detect the virus in the specimens collected, and only limited sporadic cases of the virus have been detected in the United States in 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As health officials investigate the current rise of AFM cases, to prevent illness, they are advising people wash their hands with soap and water, avoid close contact with sick people, and clean surfaces with a disinfectant, especially those that a sick person has touched.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe needed a tube to help him breath,\u201d says his mother Robin Roberts. \u201cDoctors were working really hard to try and figure out what was going on.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the hospital, the Roberts family was left with more questions than answers. Doctors considered a list of diagnoses from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome to various other auto-immune diseases. Finally, after an MRI scan and hours of waiting, Carter was diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) \u2014 a mysterious muscle weakness, similar to polio \u2014 that appears to be on the rise this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carter Roberts and his two sisters before he was diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis. Robin Roberts NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, as of August 2016, there have been 50 cases of confirmed AFM across 24 states. That's nearly double over 2015, when 21 cases for the whole year were reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AFM has been linked to a strain of enterovirus that's now circulating again. Some doctors are warning this could be the same mysterious, polio-like illness detected in 2014 that paralyzed 120 children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: CDC Develops Faster New Test For Enterovirus D68 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enteroviruses are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children, such as respiratory infections or even summer colds.

Most patients were found to have distinctive abnormalities of the central spinal cord (i.e., gray matter) on magnetic resonance imaging, and most reported a respiratory or febrile illness preceding the onset of neurologic symptoms. On September 12, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment alerted CDC about this cluster. These cases coincided with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) (2). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On September 26, CDC issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing (3). A case was defined as acute onset of focal limb weakness occurring on or after August 1, 2014, and a magnetic resonance image showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to gray matter in a patient aged \u226421 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of November 13, CDC had verified reports of 88 cases in 32 states (Figure). The median age of patients was 7.6 years (range = 5 months\u201320 years), and 54 (61%) were males. Limb weakness was asymmetrical in most patients. Cranial nerve motor dysfunction was reported in 30 (34%) cases. Six (7%) patients had altered mental status, and three (3%) had seizures. Most patients reported a respiratory illness (81%), a febrile illness (68%), or both, occurring before neurologic symptom onset; 8% had neither condition. Among 86 patients for whom past medical history was reported, 65 (76%) were previously healthy, and 21 (24%) had underlying illnesses, most commonly asthma (nine [10%]). All but one patient was hospitalized because of neurologic illness, and 17 (19%) required ventilator support. Among 80 patients from whom cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, 68 (85%) showed a moderate pleocytosis and normal or mildly elevated protein. Information regarding current clinical status was reported for 77 patients (median follow-up = 19 days). Of those, 49 (64%) reported some symptom improvement, and 28 (36%) showed no improvement; none were fully recovered. No deaths were reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among 71 patients with cerebrospinal fluid testing performed by their health care providers, state and local public health departments, or CDC, no enteroviruses or other pathogens have been confirmed to date. Among 41 patients whose upper respiratory tract samples were available for enterovirus/rhinovirus testing at CDC, 17 (41%) tested positive: eight (20%) for EV-D68 and nine (22%) for eight other enterovirus/rhinovirus types. Of the 19 patients whose upper respiratory tract samples were obtained <14 days from respiratory illness onset, 10 (53%) were positive: seven (37%) for EV-D68 and three (16%) for rhinoviruses. Laboratory testing for other pathogens is ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On November 7, CDC published interim clinical management considerations, summarizing expert opinion based on current evidence on management and care of children with acute flaccid myelitis (4). CDC continues to collaborate with partners nationally to investigate reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of this condition. Although the specific causes of this illness are still under investigation, and causal relationship to EV-D68 has not yet been substantiated, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent a number of severe diseases. Vaccine-preventable diseases include poliomyelitis, which is caused by poliovirus; infection with this enterovirus can present with acute flaccid paralysis. There are also numerous other vaccine-preventable diseases that can result in severe illness. Prevention of viral infections includes general hygienic measures, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Additional information is available at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/habits/index.htm. If a child appears to have a sudden onset of weakness in arms or legs, caregivers should contact a health care provider to have the child assessed for possible neurologic illness. Health care providers are encouraged to report patients meeting the case definition to their state or local health department. Health departments should report patients with illness meeting the case definition to CDC using a brief patient summary form* and may contact CDC by e-mail to arrange further laboratory testing (limbweakness@cdc.gov).

(Family photos) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before dinner on July 29, 3-year-old Carter Roberts of Chesterfield, Va., seemed perfectly healthy. That evening, he vomited. When he woke up the next morning with a slight fever of 99 degrees, his mother, Robin Roberts, figured that he was coming down with a cold. The next morning, she found him collapsed on his bedroom floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cMommy,\u201d she recalls him saying. \u201cHelp me, help me.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carter could barely stand when she picked him up, and his neck was arched backward. \u201cWhat was most alarming,\u201d she said, \u201cis he had no control over his right arm whatsoever.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the hospital, Carter lost control of his right arm, then over his legs and other muscles within a few days. He now can only wiggle a toe and move the left side of his face. He has been diagnosed with a mysterious, polio-like illness called acute flaccid myelitis, a condition that seems to be surging this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Through July, 32 new cases of AFM have been confirmed across the United States this year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a sharp rise compared with last year, when just seven cases had been confirmed by that month. The numbers have risen steadily since April. In past years, most cases have occurred between August and December, with a peak in October.

Although most cases occur in children, AFM occasionally affects adults. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC official who leads the surveillance efforts said that confirmed numbers for August will not be available until the end of this month, but the number of reports she is receiving from doctors around the country continues to rise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cCDC is looking at these trends very carefully,\u201d Manisha Patel said. \u201cWe have sent out several health alerts to states to let them know we are seeing an increase in reporting and to encourage them to communicate with doctors to report these cases in a timely fashion.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC began tracking AFM in 2014, when 121 cases were confirmed. That year, the CDC counted only children affected by the disease. Their average age was 7. Most had a fever or a respiratory illness a few days before developing paralysis. Many had to be placed on respirators. Although 85 percent of the children recovered partially, only three of them recovered fully.

It's a major improvement for someone with this polio-like illness. (Facebook/Team Braden Luke) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health officials and physicians around the country said they are concerned that the rising number of cases through July could foretell a repeat of 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou hate to be an alarmist, but there\u2019s reason to have some concern,\u201d said Avindra Nath, chief of the section of infections of the nervous system at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. \u201cWhat we don't know is where are these cases. Are they clustered? Do they all look alike? Getting more information on these cases would be helpful.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beyond saying that confirmed cases have been reported in 17 states through July, Patel declined to reveal which states have been involved. But conversations and emails with physicians around the country indicate that at least four cases have occurred in California and at least three in Massachusetts, and that others have been seen in Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York, as well as Virginia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe are definitely hearing of cases from our colleagues across the country,\u201d said Teri Schreiner, a neurologist at the University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend that\u2019s worrisome \u2026 what I'm hearing from others seems to be coming at a tempo similar to what happened in 2014.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jean-Baptiste Le Pichon of Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., said that doctors on a U.S. email list for pediatric neurologists reported five new cases of AFM in just the past few days. \u201cThere is definitely an explosion of cases,\u201d Le Pichon said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No treatment other than physical therapy has yet been shown to markedly improve outcomes, although some doctors have reported that treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), used to treat some other viral infectious diseases afflicting the nervous system, might help. It\u2019s also been suggested that Prozac could prove beneficial. The degree of paralysis in the first month has generally improved only slightly over the course of a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAfter about a year or so, what you\u2019ve got is what you\u2019ve got,\u201d said Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Case Western Reverse University in Cleveland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most perplexing is what causes the disease. The 2014 outbreak of AFM occurred at the same time as a far larger outbreak of enterovirus D68 across the United States. The vast majority of patients infected with the virus developed only a respiratory illness. Some physicians were convinced that EV-D68 was the cause, not only because both outbreaks occurred at the same time but also because of a study that identified a particular strain of EV-D68 in the airways of children with AFM. But officials at the CDC and some doctors, including Wiznitzer, insist that the cause remains unproved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far this year, no similarly widespread outbreak of EV-D68 respiratory infections has been reported, although cases of it and other enteroviruses have been seen in some areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday, Le Pichon, in Kansas City, said, \u201cI just got confirmation that we have an epidemic of enterovirus breaking out here and at least a few cases [of enterovirus] have typed positive for EV-D68.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carol Glaser, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., said: \u201cIf the theory is right that it\u2019s caused by EV-D68, which some of us believe more than others, this would be the time of year we start seeing it. It\u2019s an enterovirus, and they tend to peak in late summer and early fall.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the CDC\u2019s surveillance of AFM is less than two years old, it remains unclear if some of this year\u2019s apparent rise in confirmed cases is due simply to more doctors sending in case reports, Patel said. And Wiznitzer emphasized that with just 32 confirmed cases across the United States so far, AFM remains extremely rare NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Glaser, however, said she is convinced that the condition is new. She worked at the California Department of Public Health when, in 2012, some of the first reports of AFM anywhere in the country came in from physicians there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI was there for 15 years and talked to neurologists every single day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the fall of 2012 when the first physician called in and wanted a test for polio on one of his patients. One of my colleagues in the office chuckled and said to me, \u2018We don't have polio in the United States.\u2019 But in the next two weeks, I got two very similar phone calls. We had never had a report like that. I do think there was something new going on. Fortunately, it\u2019s still rare.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If EV-D68 does somehow cause AFM, studying the virus may lead to prevention or treatment. One glimmer of good news came from Kenneth Tyler, chair of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. He and his colleagues have been conducting experiments to infect mice with EV-D68 and have them develop loss of muscle control like that seen in AFM. He says he has submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed medical journal describing his success in doing so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The goal, he said, is to use mice to study how EV-D68 causes harm to the spinal cord and muscles, and to test potential therapies, such as IVIG. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re seeing protection with IVIG in the mouse model,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robin Roberts said she wishes more was known about the condition that has harmed her son. \u201cIn this day and age to not have information about something like this is very frustrating. There needs to be more done about it, and for more parents and doctors to know about it,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Angie Andersen said that her daughter McKenzie was sent home from the hospital twice in the first two weeks of her illness because doctors did not understand the severity of what was happening. Finally her pediatrician told Andersen to bring McKenzie to another hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McKenzie was 6 years old when she developed sniffles in December 2014. \u201cWithin 12 days,\u201d Andersen said, \u201cshe was paralyzed from the neck down, on a ventilator to breathe for her. She was left with her left hand and her feet and toes that move.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou know you could understand the bad that comes from a car wreck, or if she got cancer,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cHow do you ever wrap your brain around the fact that she got a cold, and now she\u2019s a quadriplegic on a ventilator? It\u2019s a nightmare you never wake up from.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, she said, McKenzie can now speak and even sing softly despite having a tracheotomy. \u201cShe has a lot of spunk, and that is helping her through,\u201d Andersen said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From Jan. 1 to Aug. 31, 2016, the CDC reported 50 people in 24 U.S. states had been diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), compared with only 21 people in 2015 in 16 U.S. states. From August to December 2014, 120 people, mostly patients 21 and younger, in 34 U.S. states, were diagnosed with the condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AFM affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, according to the CDC. The cause is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections like polio and non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Enteroviruses can cause neurologic illness such as meningitis, but more serious disease like encephalitis and AFM are less common. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Symptoms of AFM include pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and, most severely, respiratory failure that can occur when muscles involved in breathing become weak. The latter symptom can require urgent ventilator support, according to the CDC. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but rather neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the AFM outbreak in 2014 coincided with an outbreak of enterovirus D68, the CDC did not detect traces of the severe respiratory virus in the AFM specimens collected that year. Among the people with AFM in 2015, the CDC also did not detect the virus in the specimens collected, and only limited sporadic cases of the virus have been detected in the United States in 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As health officials investigate the current rise of AFM cases, to prevent illness, they are advising people wash their hands with soap and water, avoid close contact with sick people, and clean surfaces with a disinfectant, especially those that a sick person has touched.

Most patients were found to have distinctive abnormalities of the central spinal cord (i.e., gray matter) on magnetic resonance imaging, and most reported a respiratory or febrile illness preceding the onset of neurologic symptoms. On September 12, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment alerted CDC about this cluster. These cases coincided with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) (2). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On September 26, CDC issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing (3). A case was defined as acute onset of focal limb weakness occurring on or after August 1, 2014, and a magnetic resonance image showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to gray matter in a patient aged \u226421 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of November 13, CDC had verified reports of 88 cases in 32 states (Figure). The median age of patients was 7.6 years (range = 5 months\u201320 years), and 54 (61%) were males. Limb weakness was asymmetrical in most patients. Cranial nerve motor dysfunction was reported in 30 (34%) cases. Six (7%) patients had altered mental status, and three (3%) had seizures. Most patients reported a respiratory illness (81%), a febrile illness (68%), or both, occurring before neurologic symptom onset; 8% had neither condition. Among 86 patients for whom past medical history was reported, 65 (76%) were previously healthy, and 21 (24%) had underlying illnesses, most commonly asthma (nine [10%]). All but one patient was hospitalized because of neurologic illness, and 17 (19%) required ventilator support. Among 80 patients from whom cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, 68 (85%) showed a moderate pleocytosis and normal or mildly elevated protein. Information regarding current clinical status was reported for 77 patients (median follow-up = 19 days). Of those, 49 (64%) reported some symptom improvement, and 28 (36%) showed no improvement; none were fully recovered. No deaths were reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among 71 patients with cerebrospinal fluid testing performed by their health care providers, state and local public health departments, or CDC, no enteroviruses or other pathogens have been confirmed to date. Among 41 patients whose upper respiratory tract samples were available for enterovirus/rhinovirus testing at CDC, 17 (41%) tested positive: eight (20%) for EV-D68 and nine (22%) for eight other enterovirus/rhinovirus types. Of the 19 patients whose upper respiratory tract samples were obtained <14 days from respiratory illness onset, 10 (53%) were positive: seven (37%) for EV-D68 and three (16%) for rhinoviruses. Laboratory testing for other pathogens is ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On November 7, CDC published interim clinical management considerations, summarizing expert opinion based on current evidence on management and care of children with acute flaccid myelitis (4). CDC continues to collaborate with partners nationally to investigate reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of this condition. Although the specific causes of this illness are still under investigation, and causal relationship to EV-D68 has not yet been substantiated, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent a number of severe diseases. Vaccine-preventable diseases include poliomyelitis, which is caused by poliovirus; infection with this enterovirus can present with acute flaccid paralysis. There are also numerous other vaccine-preventable diseases that can result in severe illness. Prevention of viral infections includes general hygienic measures, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.

What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing. About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling. The CDC reports 121 cases of AFM were confirmed in 2014, but that was followed by just 21 cases in 2015, reports Fox News. From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully. A CDC study found 68% of patients had a fever and 81% had a respiratory illness before AFM symptoms appeared.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nA blood pattern analysis of the Shroud of Turin has revealed that there's just absolutely no way the stains could have been made by a body laying flat on the fabric. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pair of researchers have found that the blood-like splotches on the linen cloth are inconsistent with each other - some can only have occurred by a person standing upright, while another is completely unrealistic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The famous length of fabric, which bears the image of a man, has long been thought to be the cloth that once wrapped the body of Christian figurehead Jesus of Nazareth. The imprint is said to have been transferred during the three days his body was interred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientific analysis has not yet yielded an answer as to how the image was created on the fabric, but several reddish stains consistent with the reported crucifixion wounds of Jesus of Nazareth contain iron oxide - which could be from pigment, or could be from blood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, radiocarbon techniques have dated the shroud to between 1260 and 1390 CE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The weave and the fabricweave and the fabric are both consistent with the Jesus of Nazareth time frame, as well as the Middle Ages; analysis of the cloth shows inconclusive evidence for pigment; and research determining a Middle Eastern provenance for pollen found on the cloth was later disavowed by one of its authors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Radiocarbon dating notwithstanding, it would be fascinating to know exactly how the shroud was made; and, if it's real, it could reveal new information about crucifixion techniques. Because evidence for the shroud's authenticity has been so inconclusive, there has been recent scientific interest in using forensic techniques to investigate it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is where forensic anthropologist Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and organic chemist Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences enter the picture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rather than testing the substance itself, the researchers used a live subject and a mannequin to analyse the blood flow on wounds on the left hand, the forearms, the \"lance wound\" in the torso, and blood stains around the figure's waist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The technique is called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis; for this, they used two types of blood: human blood donated for the research, and synthetic blood with the same fluid properties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers studied the flow for different positions: on the back of the hand in contact with wood, to observe the pattern left on the hand; on the left forearm, with blood trickling from the hand, in a standing position, and again in a supine (lying on the back) position with the hand covering the groin, as seen on the shroud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They also investigated the short trickles on the back of the left hand; and the blood over the spear wound, as well as the lumbar region, thought to be blood flow from that wound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wood test was inconclusive, but the blood flow tests show that the shroud is a mess. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For starters, the trickles on the back of the hand and the flow along the arm occurred at two completely different angles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trickles from the hand as seen on the shroud occurred in the tests with the arms at a 45 degree angle, but that just doesn't work for the supposed position of the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The angle between the arm and the body must be greater than 80\u00b0 and smaller than 100\u00b0 in order for the rivulets to flow from the wrist toward the elbow on the outer part of the forearm, as it appears on the Shroud,\" the researchers wrote in their paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Borrini & Garlaschelli/Journal of Forensic Science) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spear wound bled in a direction consistent with the Shroud image when the test subject was upright, as would occur if the victim were pierced while hanging crucified, but with one key difference: it formed rivulets, rather than a solidly filled stain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for the lower back stain, the scientists could not replicate it at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They attempted it with both bleeding from a supine position, as well as a test subject that had been standing and then laid on its back, and nothing managed to produce a \"blood belt\" in the lower back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Assuming that the red stains on the Turin linen are actually blood from the crucifixion wounds, the results of the experiments demonstrate that the alleged flowing patterns from different areas of the body are not consistent with each other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Even supposing possible different episodes of bleeding (e.g., movements of the body, postmortem bleeding), these are not only non-documented, but also, as for the lumbar stains, they appear to be unrealistic,\" the researchers wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The inconsistencies identified by the authors seem not only to point against their own reality, but against the authenticity of the Shroud itself, suggesting that the Turin linen was an artistic or 'didactic' representation from the XIV century.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That doesn't mean the show is entirely over yet: until scientists are able to figure out exactly how the image was formed on the fabric, it's going to remain a tantalising scientific mystery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their findings have been published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences.\nPassage 2:\nThe Shroud of Turin, which has been revered by some Christians as the burial cloth of Jesus, could be a fake, according to a new forensic investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investigation into the bloodstain pattern on the cloth was reported Tuesday in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and is apparently the first such analysis of the controversial shroud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, the shroud shows the image of a crucified man and has been analyzed and scrutinized for many, many years. The Vatican regards it as an icon, rather than a religious relic\u2014and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, more than 2 million people saw the Shroud of Turin, which is 14-feet-long, 3.5-feet-wide and kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case. The cloth has long been the subject of debate and study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers concluded that the linen seems to be patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, reports BuzzFeed News, adding evidence to claims that it is a fraud.

By pumping blood onto a model at wound points shown on the shroud, researchers could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction depicted on the linen.

Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees. A simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone. \u201cThis is just not what happens to a person on a cross,\u201d Borrini said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cOverall, the approach is founded in science and the methodology sound,\u201d bloodstain pattern expert Jonathyn Priest of Bevel, Gardner and Associates Inc. told BuzzFeed News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Priest cautioned that the conclusions were based on body parts held in a fixed position, rather than accounting for carrying a body, cleaning a body, or preparing a body for burial, which might bear more study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe fact that flowing bloodstains exist at all on a deceased body that was reportedly cleaned also raises questions,\u201d he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although this latest research is not definitive, generations of the faithful will continue to be fascinated by the Shroud of Turin.\nPassage 3:\n\u201cThis is just not what happens to a person on a cross,\u201d said a forensic investigator.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nThis story appears in the December 12, 2017 issue of Forbes. Subscribe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fresh off a tour through Thailand, Laos and China, United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr. picked up the phone on a Sunday afternoon in October to discuss something deeply personal: how much money he has. A year earlier, Forbes had listed his net worth at $2.9 billion on The Forbes 400, a number Ross claimed was far too low: He maintained he was closer to $3.7 billion. Now, after examining the financial-disclosure forms he filed after his nomination to President Donald Trump's Cabinet, which showed less than $700 million in assets, Forbes was intent on removing him entirely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross protested, citing trusts for his family that he said he did not have to disclose in federal filings. \"You're apparently not counting those, which are more than $2 billion,\" he said. When asked for documentation, the 79-year-old demurred, citing \"privacy issues.\" Told that Forbes nonetheless planned to remove him from the list for the first time in 13 years, he responded: \"As long as you explain that the reason is that assets were put into trust, I'm fine with that.\" And when did he make the transfer that allowed him to not disclose over $2 billion? \"Between the election and the nomination.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So began the mystery of Wilbur Ross' missing $2 billion. And after one month of digging, Forbes is confident it has found the answer: That money never existed. It seems clear that Ross lied to us, the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with Forbes since 2004. In addition to just padding his ego, Ross' machinations helped bolster his standing in a way that translated into business opportunities. And based on our interviews with ten former employees at Ross' private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., who all confirmed parts of the same story line, his penchant for misleading extended to colleagues and investors, resulting in millions of dollars in fines, tens of millions refunded to backers and numerous lawsuits. Additionally, according to six U.S. senators, Ross failed to initially mention 19 suits in response to a questionnaire during his confirmation process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly a week before this article went to press, both Ross and his team at the Commerce Department were sent a detailed list of questions. \"Secretary Ross has filed all required disclosures in accordance with the law and in consultation with both legal counsel and ethics officials at the Department of Commerce and Office of Government Ethics. As we have said before, any misunderstanding from your previous conversation with Secretary Ross is unfortunate.\" They declined to provide further answers on the record. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ross' questionable assertions to Forbes, combined with a recent controversy about a multimillion-dollar stake in a shipping company that does big business with close associates of Vladimir Putin, paint a clearer picture of the commerce secretary's tactics. His slippery statements during his confirmation hearings--\"I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt\"--came as no surprise to those who have known Ross for decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" says David Wax, who worked alongside Ross for 25 years and served as the No. 3 person in his firm. Another former colleague, who requested anonymity, was less circumspect: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Listen to Wilbur Ross apparently lie to Forbes: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty-six years before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, Wilbur Ross disappeared. It was 1990, corporate America was sick on junk bonds, and Ross was a top bankruptcy negotiator. But one November day, he failed to show up at an important meeting to brief bondholders in a furniture company's bankruptcy. They didn't know where he had gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until they went home and turned on the television. There was Ross, with Donald Trump, announcing a deal to recapitalize Trump's Taj Mahal casino, which was then careening toward bankruptcy. They were technically adversaries, with Ross representing one group of bondholders--at one point Trump asked them to fire Ross after he dismissed a Trump proposal to keep 100% of his equity, saying, \"It's too early for Christmas.\" But Ross eventually brokered a deal among Trump, debt holder Carl Icahn and Ross' own clients that allowed Trump to keep a 50% stake. \"I think [Ross] is very talented, a fantastic negotiator,\" Trump said at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The son of a judge, he always has been. He grew up in New Jersey, attended Yale and then Harvard Business School and eventually wound up as the bankruptcy work-out specialist at the investment bank Rothschild, where he was known for his ability to quickly distill complex situations. \"He was very, very sharp,\" says someone who worked with him back then. \"Very tough.\" By the early 1990s, his unit was bringing in around $18 million a year, with Ross personally pocketing more than a third of that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross was an extremely well-paid professional, but he yearned for the big money and big spotlight that come with having your own shop. \"People knew of him,\" says another former colleague, \"but not on his own.\" At first, he worked within Rothschild, raising $200 million for an internal private equity fund that would leverage his bankruptcy expertise to pick up companies on the cheap. Three years later, in 2000, he bought out the fund and slapped his name on the door. At 62, when most investment bankers start dabbling in golf and vineyards, Ross was poised to claim some glory for himself. Says Wax: \"He viewed it as an opportunity to have a pulpit, to name something after himself and to potentially make a lot of money.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross quickly accomplished all three of those things. In 2002, his firm invested in the bankrupt steelmaker LTV. According to a Harvard Business School case study, LTV had put $1.2 billion into new plants and equipment but laid off 7,500 union employees and faced a $3.4 billion pension burden. As a master of work-outs, Ross knew he could get the federal government to take over the pensions. According to people who worked at the firm then, Ross told the unions he'd buy the business if they let him hire back just 3,500 workers. Figuring 3,500 jobs were better than none, the union agreed, and WL Ross picked up most of LTV's assets, without the pension headaches, for $135 million and about $165 million in annual environmental liabilities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross' timing was impeccable. One week later, President George W. Bush issued a stiff tariff on steel imports, sending U.S. prices soaring and making Ross look like a genius. He rolled up several more steel companies, including Bethlehem Steel, into International Steel Group, which filed for an IPO in 2003. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross was technically the beneficial owner of nearly $1 billion worth of the stock. But most of that belonged to his investors, not Ross personally. In 2005, Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal bought the business for around $4.5 billion in cash and stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross personally invested only about $3 million in his firm's first two funds, according to former employees. Buoyed by International Steel Group, he roughly tripled that money, but the bigger payout came from carried interest--the manager's cut of overall profits, typically 20%. In all, Ross made an estimated $260 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A huge score, yes, though not nearly enough to be one of the 400 richest people in America. But when a Forbes reporter reached out to Ross, apparently crediting him with his investors' money, the future commerce secretary did nothing to clarify the situation, according to notes at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I just spoke to Ross,\" the reporter wrote. \"He's one of the easiest new guys I've put on [The Forbes 400] in a while. Very low-key, said he didn't really want to be on, but at the same time wasn't going to fight success. He says he doesn't want to juice up his numbers at all.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I told him we're going to start him at $1 billion,\" added the reporter, who no longer works at Forbes . \"And he said 'Yep, fine, thank you.' \" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross appeared on The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2004, with a net worth listed at $1 billion. It was nearly four times as much as he was likely worth. \"Everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" says a former colleague of Ross. A legend was born, and like most legends, this one had its roots in a myth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within days of that fateful issue of Forbes, Ross married for the third time at a beachside church in Southampton, New York. His bride, Hilary, 12 years younger, had spent much of her life in the Hamptons and Palm Beach, two of the East Coast's most famous billionaire playgrounds. \"She brought him a certain kind of prominence, socially,\" says David Patrick Columbia, who publishes Hilary's musings on his website, New York Social Diary. \"It was a perfect merger.\" Adds another contemporary: \"She wants her husband to be on The Forbes 400.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Life began to change for Ross. Once known for quirky suspenders, he now wore impeccable suits. A workaholic for most of his career, he began spending much of the year outside of New York. He started flying private, built up a collection of paintings by the Belgian artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte and bought a Palm Beach estate for $13 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His fundraising kept pace with his spending. In 2005, he raised a $1.1 billion flagship fund, his largest yet. The next year, he sold WL Ross & Co. to the publicly traded investment-management company Invesco for $100 million up front and the ability to earn an additional $275 million, depending on how much money he was able to raise in later funds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Invesco and a big incentive behind him, Ross raised a massive $4.1 billion fund in 2007, putting roughly $70 million of his own money into that one and the 2005 predecessor, according to three former employees. His net worth at this time was likely around $400 million, thanks to the sale of WL Ross & Co. But when contacted by Forbes that year, he gave valuations for his firm's investments as if the money belonged to him. The myth, with Forbes compounding it based on our original mistake and Ross' exhortations, got bigger. Now Forbes listed Ross with a net worth of $1.7 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That wasn't enough. \"I would say the total now is a bit more than $2 billion,\" Ross wrote in a 2011 email, according to notes taken at the time. In 2013, a different Forbes reporter realized that prior estimates seemed to include not just Ross' money but that of the investors in his funds. Ross strung us along, leading us to believe he would provide evidence of his assets, but never did. Just months later, he was insisting that he was even richer, and Forbes continued to largely fall for it. \"2.75 [billion] is a bit low but probably close enough,\" he wrote in an email around the start of 2014. In September, he was arguing for a valuation of $3.45 billion but begrudgingly accepted a smaller figure: \"3.1 [billion] is low, but I understand why you wish to be conservative.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why wouldn't Ross be satisfied with $400 million? \"You're talking about someone as egotistical as they come,\" Wax says. Five other former employees add a more tangible reason: The more money Ross appeared to be worth, the more money investors seemed willing to give him. \"Really, for us, it was a bet on him, \" says Sam Green, who helped put $300 million into Ross' funds on behalf of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, citing his personal wealth as one factor. \"I don't know of any better indicator of future success than having been successful in the past.\" Ross had seemed to figure out how to make fake numbers generate real assets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2010, Ross set out to raise a new private equity fund, hoping to come up with another $4 billion. It was an audacious goal in the wake of the financial crisis, far more than many of his partners thought would be possible. After two years of fundraising, Ross closed it with just $640 million of investments. Still, he told the media he had raised $2.2 billion. Technically true but also misleading. Most of the other $1.6 billion or so came from other funds or accounts that paid little or no fee to Invesco. Given that shareholders might assume that the firm had an extra $2.2 billion of assets generating fees for its private equity arm, which was not true, Invesco later clarified the matter on an earnings call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were also charges related to transparency inside the funds. In August 2016, the SEC announced a settlement with Invesco-owned WL Ross after investigating whether the firm had charged its investors improper fees from 2001 to 2011. WL Ross agreed to pay a $2.3 million fine, without admitting or denying the findings of the investigation. It also agreed to refund $11.8 million to investors. And that was small potatoes: Buried in its 2015 annual report, Invesco disclosed that it had paid an additional $43 million in reimbursements and regulatory expenses associated with its private equity business in the previous two years. The filings don't explicitly connect that money to WL Ross--and these payments have never before been reported--but four former employees said they were all tied to Wilbur Ross' firm. Invesco declined to comment for this story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012, Ross' longtime No. 2, David Storper, left the firm but said he retained interests in many of the funds. Three years later, Storper alleged in a lawsuit that the firm sent him inaccurate financial information after his departure and that Wilbur Ross stole his interests outright. Ross denied the allegations, and the lawsuit remains ongoing. A few years earlier, a vice chairman of WL Ross sued Wilbur Ross for more than $20 million, alleging that Ross tried to cut him out of interest and fees he had been promised. The parties had reached a settlement by 2007, which former employees say cost about $10 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Storper case has other ex-employees looking back to be sure they were sent proper information. Joseph Mullin, a former member of WL Ross' 15-person investment team, filed his own suit against WL Ross & Co., also alleging that Ross took his interests after he left. The firm filed a motion to dismiss in February, but the case remains active. A third ex-colleague, who is not in litigation, argues that Ross' tactics went beyond hard-nosed negotiating: \"Everybody does some cheating, everybody does some lying. Not everybody steals from their employees.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On November 8, 2016, the night that upended American politics, Wilbur Ross was with Donald Trump, his family and top backers in New York City. The relationships inside this inner sanctum ran deep. Billionaire Phillip Ruffin, the president's Las Vegas partner who had Trump serve as best man at his wedding, was there. So was Icahn and apparently Richard LeFrak, the real estate tycoon who was part of the Palm Beach circle that included Trump and Ross. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ross was the only one who left his day job to join Trump in government. \"I'd rather hang myself,\" Ruffin told Forbes earlier this year. \"I don't know why Wilbur took it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But viewed in the context of Ross' career arc, it makes perfect sense. The steel deal made him rich, but his returns have been mediocre since, so much so that WL Ross filed documents to raise a sixth flagship fund last year, but nothing seemed to come of it. Trump, the guy he kept afloat 26 years before, offered his fellow attention-seeking dealmaker a lifeline to relevance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross' appointment as secretary of commerce came with one catch: He had to disclose his assets, providing evidence that he was not as rich as he had long claimed. In 2015, he sent Forbes a detailed breakdown of his supposed holdings, listing $1.25 billion in partnership interests, $1.1 billion in municipal bonds, $500 million in equities, $200 million in art, $110 million in real estate and $200 million in cash, for a fanciful total of $3.4 billion, according to notes taken at the time. We eventually listed him at $2.9 billion. Last year, Ross' assistant claimed $3.7 billion; we stuck with $2.9 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His former colleagues saw the moment of reckoning coming as soon as he accepted a Cabinet role. \"It was surprising because he would have to reveal to the world that he wasn't a billionaire,\" one ex-employee said. \"I was surprised that he would take that risk.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ross was ready to double down, even while he was a Cabinet member, telling Forbes about the putative $2 billion asset transfer to his family members after the election. That opened up a storm of questions from ethics and tax experts. If Ross had owned $2 billion of additional assets before the election, wouldn't they have produced income that he was required to disclose, even if he no longer owned the assets? And why would someone apparently transfer $2 billion to his family, thereby triggering more than $800 million in gift taxes, especially with a president in the White House who was prepared to eliminate the estate tax and therefore much of the cost of transferring fortunes to later generations? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I am aware of the ethics and tax rules and have complied with all of them,\" Ross wrote in an October email to Forbes . \"Aren't you going a bit overboard on this? I have explained my situation to you and am surprised and disappointed by the seemingly accusatory tone of your email. For more than 50 years I have had a good relationship with your publication and with the Forbes family. And never have had a bad experience with either. In fact I was just the featured speaker at your magazine's hundredth anniversary CEO conference in Hong Kong.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Forbes published an online story on October 16 laying out those questions, six Senate Democrats wrote a letter to the top ethics official in the federal government, asking him to figure out what was going on with Ross' finances. \"It is imperative that Congress and the Office of Government Ethics know the full extent of Mr. Ross's holdings to ensure he is not putting personal gain ahead of the interests of the American people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Department of Commerce issued a statement saying the $2 billion gift never happened. \"Contrary to the report in Forbes, there was no major asset transfer to a trust in the period between the election and Secretary Ross's confirmation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only problem with that statement: The person who told Forbes that the transfer had taken place, that it had happened after the election and that it had meant more than $2 billion of family assets weren't on the disclosure was none other than the sitting secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross.\nPassage 2:\nDefending his appointment of a billionaire to promote the country\u2019s economic growth, Donald Trump has said that he does not want poor people to hold economic roles in his administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking at a rally in Iowa, the President declared: \u201cSomebody said why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy? No it\u2019s true. And Wilbur\u2019s [commerce secretary Wilbur Ross] a very rich person in charge of commerce.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Associated Press contributed to this report\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThis story appears in the December 12, 2017 issue of Forbes. Subscribe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fresh off a tour through Thailand, Laos and China, United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr. picked up the phone on a Sunday afternoon in October to discuss something deeply personal: how much money he has. A year earlier, Forbes had listed his net worth at $2.9 billion on The Forbes 400, a number Ross claimed was far too low: He maintained he was closer to $3.7 billion. Now, after examining the financial-disclosure forms he filed after his nomination to President Donald Trump's Cabinet, which showed less than $700 million in assets, Forbes was intent on removing him entirely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross protested, citing trusts for his family that he said he did not have to disclose in federal filings. \"You're apparently not counting those, which are more than $2 billion,\" he said. When asked for documentation, the 79-year-old demurred, citing \"privacy issues.\" Told that Forbes nonetheless planned to remove him from the list for the first time in 13 years, he responded: \"As long as you explain that the reason is that assets were put into trust, I'm fine with that.\" And when did he make the transfer that allowed him to not disclose over $2 billion? \"Between the election and the nomination.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So began the mystery of Wilbur Ross' missing $2 billion. And after one month of digging, Forbes is confident it has found the answer: That money never existed. It seems clear that Ross lied to us, the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with Forbes since 2004. In addition to just padding his ego, Ross' machinations helped bolster his standing in a way that translated into business opportunities. And based on our interviews with ten former employees at Ross' private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., who all confirmed parts of the same story line, his penchant for misleading extended to colleagues and investors, resulting in millions of dollars in fines, tens of millions refunded to backers and numerous lawsuits. Additionally, according to six U.S. senators, Ross failed to initially mention 19 suits in response to a questionnaire during his confirmation process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly a week before this article went to press, both Ross and his team at the Commerce Department were sent a detailed list of questions. \"Secretary Ross has filed all required disclosures in accordance with the law and in consultation with both legal counsel and ethics officials at the Department of Commerce and Office of Government Ethics. As we have said before, any misunderstanding from your previous conversation with Secretary Ross is unfortunate.\" They declined to provide further answers on the record. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ross' questionable assertions to Forbes, combined with a recent controversy about a multimillion-dollar stake in a shipping company that does big business with close associates of Vladimir Putin, paint a clearer picture of the commerce secretary's tactics. His slippery statements during his confirmation hearings--\"I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt\"--came as no surprise to those who have known Ross for decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" says David Wax, who worked alongside Ross for 25 years and served as the No. 3 person in his firm. Another former colleague, who requested anonymity, was less circumspect: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Listen to Wilbur Ross apparently lie to Forbes: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty-six years before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, Wilbur Ross disappeared. It was 1990, corporate America was sick on junk bonds, and Ross was a top bankruptcy negotiator. But one November day, he failed to show up at an important meeting to brief bondholders in a furniture company's bankruptcy. They didn't know where he had gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until they went home and turned on the television. There was Ross, with Donald Trump, announcing a deal to recapitalize Trump's Taj Mahal casino, which was then careening toward bankruptcy. They were technically adversaries, with Ross representing one group of bondholders--at one point Trump asked them to fire Ross after he dismissed a Trump proposal to keep 100% of his equity, saying, \"It's too early for Christmas.\" But Ross eventually brokered a deal among Trump, debt holder Carl Icahn and Ross' own clients that allowed Trump to keep a 50% stake. \"I think [Ross] is very talented, a fantastic negotiator,\" Trump said at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The son of a judge, he always has been. He grew up in New Jersey, attended Yale and then Harvard Business School and eventually wound up as the bankruptcy work-out specialist at the investment bank Rothschild, where he was known for his ability to quickly distill complex situations. \"He was very, very sharp,\" says someone who worked with him back then. \"Very tough.\" By the early 1990s, his unit was bringing in around $18 million a year, with Ross personally pocketing more than a third of that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross was an extremely well-paid professional, but he yearned for the big money and big spotlight that come with having your own shop. \"People knew of him,\" says another former colleague, \"but not on his own.\" At first, he worked within Rothschild, raising $200 million for an internal private equity fund that would leverage his bankruptcy expertise to pick up companies on the cheap. Three years later, in 2000, he bought out the fund and slapped his name on the door. At 62, when most investment bankers start dabbling in golf and vineyards, Ross was poised to claim some glory for himself. Says Wax: \"He viewed it as an opportunity to have a pulpit, to name something after himself and to potentially make a lot of money.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross quickly accomplished all three of those things. In 2002, his firm invested in the bankrupt steelmaker LTV. According to a Harvard Business School case study, LTV had put $1.2 billion into new plants and equipment but laid off 7,500 union employees and faced a $3.4 billion pension burden. As a master of work-outs, Ross knew he could get the federal government to take over the pensions. According to people who worked at the firm then, Ross told the unions he'd buy the business if they let him hire back just 3,500 workers. Figuring 3,500 jobs were better than none, the union agreed, and WL Ross picked up most of LTV's assets, without the pension headaches, for $135 million and about $165 million in annual environmental liabilities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross' timing was impeccable. One week later, President George W. Bush issued a stiff tariff on steel imports, sending U.S. prices soaring and making Ross look like a genius. He rolled up several more steel companies, including Bethlehem Steel, into International Steel Group, which filed for an IPO in 2003. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross was technically the beneficial owner of nearly $1 billion worth of the stock. But most of that belonged to his investors, not Ross personally. In 2005, Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal bought the business for around $4.5 billion in cash and stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross personally invested only about $3 million in his firm's first two funds, according to former employees. Buoyed by International Steel Group, he roughly tripled that money, but the bigger payout came from carried interest--the manager's cut of overall profits, typically 20%. In all, Ross made an estimated $260 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A huge score, yes, though not nearly enough to be one of the 400 richest people in America. But when a Forbes reporter reached out to Ross, apparently crediting him with his investors' money, the future commerce secretary did nothing to clarify the situation, according to notes at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I just spoke to Ross,\" the reporter wrote. \"He's one of the easiest new guys I've put on [The Forbes 400] in a while. Very low-key, said he didn't really want to be on, but at the same time wasn't going to fight success. He says he doesn't want to juice up his numbers at all.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I told him we're going to start him at $1 billion,\" added the reporter, who no longer works at Forbes . \"And he said 'Yep, fine, thank you.' \" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross appeared on The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2004, with a net worth listed at $1 billion. It was nearly four times as much as he was likely worth. \"Everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" says a former colleague of Ross. A legend was born, and like most legends, this one had its roots in a myth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within days of that fateful issue of Forbes, Ross married for the third time at a beachside church in Southampton, New York. His bride, Hilary, 12 years younger, had spent much of her life in the Hamptons and Palm Beach, two of the East Coast's most famous billionaire playgrounds. \"She brought him a certain kind of prominence, socially,\" says David Patrick Columbia, who publishes Hilary's musings on his website, New York Social Diary. \"It was a perfect merger.\" Adds another contemporary: \"She wants her husband to be on The Forbes 400.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Life began to change for Ross. Once known for quirky suspenders, he now wore impeccable suits. A workaholic for most of his career, he began spending much of the year outside of New York. He started flying private, built up a collection of paintings by the Belgian artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte and bought a Palm Beach estate for $13 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His fundraising kept pace with his spending. In 2005, he raised a $1.1 billion flagship fund, his largest yet. The next year, he sold WL Ross & Co. to the publicly traded investment-management company Invesco for $100 million up front and the ability to earn an additional $275 million, depending on how much money he was able to raise in later funds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Invesco and a big incentive behind him, Ross raised a massive $4.1 billion fund in 2007, putting roughly $70 million of his own money into that one and the 2005 predecessor, according to three former employees. His net worth at this time was likely around $400 million, thanks to the sale of WL Ross & Co. But when contacted by Forbes that year, he gave valuations for his firm's investments as if the money belonged to him. The myth, with Forbes compounding it based on our original mistake and Ross' exhortations, got bigger. Now Forbes listed Ross with a net worth of $1.7 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That wasn't enough. \"I would say the total now is a bit more than $2 billion,\" Ross wrote in a 2011 email, according to notes taken at the time. In 2013, a different Forbes reporter realized that prior estimates seemed to include not just Ross' money but that of the investors in his funds. Ross strung us along, leading us to believe he would provide evidence of his assets, but never did. Just months later, he was insisting that he was even richer, and Forbes continued to largely fall for it. \"2.75 [billion] is a bit low but probably close enough,\" he wrote in an email around the start of 2014. In September, he was arguing for a valuation of $3.45 billion but begrudgingly accepted a smaller figure: \"3.1 [billion] is low, but I understand why you wish to be conservative.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why wouldn't Ross be satisfied with $400 million? \"You're talking about someone as egotistical as they come,\" Wax says. Five other former employees add a more tangible reason: The more money Ross appeared to be worth, the more money investors seemed willing to give him. \"Really, for us, it was a bet on him, \" says Sam Green, who helped put $300 million into Ross' funds on behalf of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, citing his personal wealth as one factor. \"I don't know of any better indicator of future success than having been successful in the past.\" Ross had seemed to figure out how to make fake numbers generate real assets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2010, Ross set out to raise a new private equity fund, hoping to come up with another $4 billion. It was an audacious goal in the wake of the financial crisis, far more than many of his partners thought would be possible. After two years of fundraising, Ross closed it with just $640 million of investments. Still, he told the media he had raised $2.2 billion. Technically true but also misleading. Most of the other $1.6 billion or so came from other funds or accounts that paid little or no fee to Invesco. Given that shareholders might assume that the firm had an extra $2.2 billion of assets generating fees for its private equity arm, which was not true, Invesco later clarified the matter on an earnings call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were also charges related to transparency inside the funds. In August 2016, the SEC announced a settlement with Invesco-owned WL Ross after investigating whether the firm had charged its investors improper fees from 2001 to 2011. WL Ross agreed to pay a $2.3 million fine, without admitting or denying the findings of the investigation. It also agreed to refund $11.8 million to investors. And that was small potatoes: Buried in its 2015 annual report, Invesco disclosed that it had paid an additional $43 million in reimbursements and regulatory expenses associated with its private equity business in the previous two years. The filings don't explicitly connect that money to WL Ross--and these payments have never before been reported--but four former employees said they were all tied to Wilbur Ross' firm. Invesco declined to comment for this story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012, Ross' longtime No. 2, David Storper, left the firm but said he retained interests in many of the funds. Three years later, Storper alleged in a lawsuit that the firm sent him inaccurate financial information after his departure and that Wilbur Ross stole his interests outright. Ross denied the allegations, and the lawsuit remains ongoing. A few years earlier, a vice chairman of WL Ross sued Wilbur Ross for more than $20 million, alleging that Ross tried to cut him out of interest and fees he had been promised. The parties had reached a settlement by 2007, which former employees say cost about $10 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Storper case has other ex-employees looking back to be sure they were sent proper information. Joseph Mullin, a former member of WL Ross' 15-person investment team, filed his own suit against WL Ross & Co., also alleging that Ross took his interests after he left. The firm filed a motion to dismiss in February, but the case remains active. A third ex-colleague, who is not in litigation, argues that Ross' tactics went beyond hard-nosed negotiating: \"Everybody does some cheating, everybody does some lying. Not everybody steals from their employees.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On November 8, 2016, the night that upended American politics, Wilbur Ross was with Donald Trump, his family and top backers in New York City. The relationships inside this inner sanctum ran deep. Billionaire Phillip Ruffin, the president's Las Vegas partner who had Trump serve as best man at his wedding, was there. So was Icahn and apparently Richard LeFrak, the real estate tycoon who was part of the Palm Beach circle that included Trump and Ross. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ross was the only one who left his day job to join Trump in government. \"I'd rather hang myself,\" Ruffin told Forbes earlier this year. \"I don't know why Wilbur took it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But viewed in the context of Ross' career arc, it makes perfect sense. The steel deal made him rich, but his returns have been mediocre since, so much so that WL Ross filed documents to raise a sixth flagship fund last year, but nothing seemed to come of it. Trump, the guy he kept afloat 26 years before, offered his fellow attention-seeking dealmaker a lifeline to relevance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross' appointment as secretary of commerce came with one catch: He had to disclose his assets, providing evidence that he was not as rich as he had long claimed. In 2015, he sent Forbes a detailed breakdown of his supposed holdings, listing $1.25 billion in partnership interests, $1.1 billion in municipal bonds, $500 million in equities, $200 million in art, $110 million in real estate and $200 million in cash, for a fanciful total of $3.4 billion, according to notes taken at the time. We eventually listed him at $2.9 billion. Last year, Ross' assistant claimed $3.7 billion; we stuck with $2.9 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His former colleagues saw the moment of reckoning coming as soon as he accepted a Cabinet role. \"It was surprising because he would have to reveal to the world that he wasn't a billionaire,\" one ex-employee said. \"I was surprised that he would take that risk.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ross was ready to double down, even while he was a Cabinet member, telling Forbes about the putative $2 billion asset transfer to his family members after the election. That opened up a storm of questions from ethics and tax experts. If Ross had owned $2 billion of additional assets before the election, wouldn't they have produced income that he was required to disclose, even if he no longer owned the assets? And why would someone apparently transfer $2 billion to his family, thereby triggering more than $800 million in gift taxes, especially with a president in the White House who was prepared to eliminate the estate tax and therefore much of the cost of transferring fortunes to later generations? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I am aware of the ethics and tax rules and have complied with all of them,\" Ross wrote in an October email to Forbes . \"Aren't you going a bit overboard on this? I have explained my situation to you and am surprised and disappointed by the seemingly accusatory tone of your email. For more than 50 years I have had a good relationship with your publication and with the Forbes family. And never have had a bad experience with either. In fact I was just the featured speaker at your magazine's hundredth anniversary CEO conference in Hong Kong.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Forbes published an online story on October 16 laying out those questions, six Senate Democrats wrote a letter to the top ethics official in the federal government, asking him to figure out what was going on with Ross' finances. \"It is imperative that Congress and the Office of Government Ethics know the full extent of Mr. Ross's holdings to ensure he is not putting personal gain ahead of the interests of the American people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Department of Commerce issued a statement saying the $2 billion gift never happened. \"Contrary to the report in Forbes, there was no major asset transfer to a trust in the period between the election and Secretary Ross's confirmation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only problem with that statement: The person who told Forbes that the transfer had taken place, that it had happened after the election and that it had meant more than $2 billion of family assets weren't on the disclosure was none other than the sitting secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross.\nPassage 2:\nDefending his appointment of a billionaire to promote the country\u2019s economic growth, Donald Trump has said that he does not want poor people to hold economic roles in his administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking at a rally in Iowa, the President declared: \u201cSomebody said why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy? No it\u2019s true.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Associated Press contributed to this report\n", "answers": ["Earlier this year, President Trump noted \"I just don't want a poor person\" in charge of economic posts in his administration, then touted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as \"a very rich person\" who was up to the task. But just how rich Ross really is is now up in the air, Forbes reports, noting it's yanked Ross off its billionaires list after a one-month probe revealed that $2 billion or so or Ross' alleged fortune \"never existed,\" and that Ross had engaged in an \"apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications, and whoppers\" with the magazine going back 13 years. The discovery came when Ross, 79, contacted Forbes in October to refute his ranking: Last year he was listed with a net worth of $2.9 billion on the Forbes 400; he claimed he was worth closer to $3.7 billion. Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The actress, who has been a vocal part of the #MeToo movement, took to Twitter on Saturday to call the actor out for his controversial statements made during an interview with ABC News Thursday about the sex scandals wracking Hollywood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the interview, Damon says there is a \"spectrum\" to behavior, and that we live in a \"culture of outrage.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"All of that behavior needs to be confronted, but there is a continuum. On this end of the continuum where you have rape and child molestation or whatever, you know, that\u2019s prison,\" he said. \"That\u2019s criminal behavior and it needs to be dealt with that way. The other stuff is just kind of shameful and gross... I just think that we have to start delineating between what these behaviors are.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Milano spoke up about Damon's comments in a series of tweets addressed to the actor.

And it is righteous,\" she wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clarence Thomas accuser Anita Hill to spearhead fight against harassment in Hollywood Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver was discussing comments by Matt Damon, whom she once dated and with whom she starred in the Oscar-winning 1997 film Good Will Hunting. In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved \u201ca spectrum of behaviour\u201d. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damon said there was \u201ca difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that society was in a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and said it was \u201cwonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it\u2019s totally necessary\u201d. But he said: \u201cWe live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we\u2019re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, \u2018Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.\u2019\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: \u201cGod God, seriously? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cGosh it\u2019s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women\u2019s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver\u2019s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: \u201cThere are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it\u2019s still cancer.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: \u201cI felt I desperately needed to say something. I\u2019ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can\u2019t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it\u2019s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver\u2019s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat\u2019s the sign of somebody who \u2013 well, we can work with that,\u201d Damon said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know Louis CK. I\u2019ve never met him. I\u2019m a fan of his, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he\u2019s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... \u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me that he thinks that because he didn\u2019t rape somebody \u2013 so far as we know \u2013 that what he did do wasn\u2019t as bad.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said \u201cthese stories are true\u201d but did not specifically apologise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat\u2019s a problem,\u201d Driver continued. \u201cIf good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we\u2019re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,\u201d she said. \u201cPut abuse in there \u2026 that all abuse is equal but some is worse.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She added: \u201cThere is no hierarchy of abuse \u2013 that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn\u2019t want or ask for \u2026 you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAnd it certainly can\u2019t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Jackson: I blacklisted Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino under pressure from Weinstein Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHow about: it\u2019s all fucking wrong and it\u2019s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it\u2019s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not. Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere is not a woman I know,\u201d Driver said, \u201cmyself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn\u2019t sleep with.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIn the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,\u201d she said, \u201cI feel that\u2019s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cMen can rally and they can support, but I don\u2019t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse. Ever.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\nPassage 3:\nMatt Damon addressed the sexual allegations against Harvey Weinstein, saying, \u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t want him married to anyone close to me.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interested in Harvey Weinstein? Add Harvey Weinstein as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Harvey Weinstein news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cBut that was the extent of what we knew. I mean, and that wasn\u2019t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that \u2014 I mean, look at the guy. Of course he\u2019s a womanizer,\u201d Damon continued in an interview for ABC News\u2019 \u201cPopcorn With Peter Travers.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damon, who stars in the upcoming film \u201cDownsizing,\u201d worked with Weinstein on his Oscar-winning film \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d which was produced by Weinstein\u2019s production company Miramax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past year, several women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Weinstein has acknowledged inappropriate behavior but has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAny allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,\u201d his spokesman previously said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a wide-ranging discussion with Travers on Tuesday, Damon opened up about Weinstein and others inside and outside the entertainment world who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read part of Damon\u2019s conversation with Travers below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maryellen McGrath/ABC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Travers: We live now in a different age, in a political age. There\u2019s a lot of dissidence that goes on in the world that could affect you as an actor. We\u2019re also in the age of people charged with sexual misconduct. This is everywhere. How do you react to that? Especially you, as the father of four girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Matt Damon: I think we\u2019re in this watershed moment. I think it\u2019s great. I think it\u2019s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories, and it\u2019s totally necessary \u2026 I do believe that there\u2019s a spectrum of behavior, right? And we\u2019re going to have to figure \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated, right? You know, we see somebody like Al Franken, right? \u2014 I personally would have preferred if they had an Ethics Committee investigation, you know what I mean? It\u2019s like at what point \u2014 you know, we\u2019re so energized to kind of get retribution, I think. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And we live in this culture of outrage and injury, and, you know, that we\u2019re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, \u201cWait a minute. None of us came here perfect.\u201d You know what I mean? \u2026 The Louis C.K. thing, I don\u2019t know all the details. I don\u2019t do deep dives on this, but I did see his statement, which kind of, which [was] arresting to me. When he came out and said, \u201cI did this. I did these things. These women are all telling the truth.\u201d And I just remember thinking, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the sign of somebody who \u2014 well, we can work with that\u201d \u2026 Like, when I\u2019m raising my kids, this constant personal responsibility is as important as anything else they learn before they go off in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the fear for me is that right now, we\u2019re in this moment where at the moment \u2014 and I hope it doesn\u2019t stay this way \u2014 the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it. Because if you take responsibility for what you did, your life\u2019s going to get ruined \u2026 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I mean, look, as I said, all of that behavior needs to be confronted, but there is a continuum. And on this end of the continuum where you have rape and child molestation or whatever, you know, that\u2019s prison. Right? And that\u2019s what needs to happen. OK? And then we can talk about rehabilitation and everything else. That\u2019s criminal behavior, and it needs to be dealt with that way. The other stuff is just kind of shameful and gross, and I just think \u2026 I don\u2019t know Louis C.K.. I\u2019ve never met him. I\u2019m a fan of his, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he\u2019s paid at this point is so beyond anything that he \u2014 I just think that we have to kind of start delineating between what these behaviors are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: It\u2019s harder, isn\u2019t it, though, when you actually know someone who gets accused? We both know Harvey Weinstein. I\u2019ve worked with him. But I didn\u2019t see any of this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: When you see Al Franken taking a picture putting his hands on that woman\u2019s flak jacket and mugging for the camera, going like that, you know, that is just like a terrible joke, and it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s wrong, and he shouldn\u2019t have done that \u2026 But when you talk about Harvey and what he\u2019s accused of, there are no pictures of that. He knew he was up to no good. There\u2019s no witnesses. There\u2019s no pictures. There\u2019s no braggadocio \u2026 So they don\u2019t belong in the same category. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: I think it becomes for all of us, too, that are in any way around it, even though we\u2019re not seeing it, is, what\u2019s our responsibility to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: A lot of people said, \u2018Well, Harvey \u2014 everybody knew.\u2019 As you were saying, that\u2019s not true. Everybody knew what kind of guy he was in the sense that if you took a meeting with him, you knew that he was tough and he was a bully, and that was his reputation. And he enjoyed that reputation, because he was making the best movies out there \u2026 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [With regard to the rape allegations,] nobody who made movies for him knew \u2026 Any human being would have put a stop to that, no matter who he was. They would\u2019ve said absolutely no. You know what I mean? \u2026 I knew I wouldn\u2019t want him married to anyone close to me. But that was the extent of what we knew, you know? And that wasn\u2019t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that \u2014 I mean, look at the guy. Of course he\u2019s a womanizer \u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t hang out with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: But you can\u2019t live his life for him. Or be responsible for his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: Right. So the question is, at what point does somebody\u2019s behavior that you have a professional relationship with \u2026 away from the profession bother enough that you don\u2019t want to work with them? For me, I\u2019ve always kind of, you know, as long as nobody\u2019s committing a crime \u2014 well, that\u2019s your life, and you go live it. I don\u2019t need to be spending time with you, away from my professional life, at least. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maryellen McGrath/ABC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: [We\u2019ve seen] Ridley Scott, who directed you in \u201cThe Martian,\u201d having to erase Kevin Spacey from \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d and having to replace him with Christopher Plummer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: That was smart. That was a total business decision by Ridley. I haven\u2019t talked to him, but \u2026 it wasn\u2019t a creative choice for Ridley. Ridley has a big movie coming out \u2026 and nobody right now is in the mood to see a Kevin Spacey movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I think he\u2019s right about that. He\u2019s one of the few directors who could just turn on a dime and shoot for a week a month before a movie comes out and, you know, expunge an actor. And I don\u2019t disagree with his decision to do that. I mean, that movie, I think, will do much better without Kevin in it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Editor\u2019s note: In response to the allegations against him made by Anthony Rapp, Kevin Spacey released a statement on Oct. 29, saying, in part, \u201cI\u2019m beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter \u2026 But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\u201d In November a spokesperson for Spacey said he was \u201ctaking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.\u201d] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: When it\u2019s in that gray area and it\u2019s friends of yours or people that you do know, do you try to talk to them afterwards and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Can I help?\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: It depends on what the accusation is. It depends what\u2019s going on. If it\u2019s a friend of mine, I\u2019m always talking to them. I know the real story if it\u2019s my friend. If it\u2019s a colleague \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 I guess it depends on the situation and the allegation and how believable I think it is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: We\u2019re going to see the change in the making of movies now with people being so aware. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: I also think the day of the confidentiality agreements is over. I think it\u2019s just completely over. Ten years ago, you made a claim against me and I had a big movie coming out, OK? I have $100 million or I have a movie that is personally important to me coming out, and close to the release of that film, you say, \u201cMatt Damon grabbed my butt and stuck his tongue down my throat.\u201d We would then go to mediation and organize a settlement. I\u2019d go, \u201cI don\u2019t want this out there. Peter\u2019s going to go out and talk to the press and run his mouth, and it\u2019s going to be overshadowing the opening of this movie. How much money do you want?\u201d The lawyers would get together, and they do this cost-benefit analysis, and they\u2019d go, \u201cOh, this is what it\u2019s worth.\u201d And I look at the number and go, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll pay it, but you can never talk about this again. You\u2019re f------ lying about this, but never talk about this again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now \u2026 with social media, these stories get \u2014 it\u2019s like they get gasoline poured on them. So the moment a claim is made, if you make that same claim today to me, I would be scorched earth. I\u2019d go, \u201cI don\u2019t care if it costs $10 million to fight this in court with you for 10 years, you are not taking my name from me. You are not taking my name and my reputation from me. I\u2019ve worked too hard for it. And I earned it. You can\u2019t just blow me up like that.\u201d So I think once a claim is made, there will no longer be settlements. That\u2019s just my prediction, I mean, just based on what I\u2019ve seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: Isn\u2019t that a good thing? Women have been doing it, and they\u2019ve been told they can\u2019t express what happened to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: One hundred percent \u2026 I think that it\u2019s important, especially in that, you know, we believe every woman who\u2019s coming forward with one of these stories needs to be listened to and heard. I think one of the surprising things for me has been the extent to which my female friends, as, I think, of all the ones I\u2019ve talked to in the last year since all this stuff started happening \u2014 I can\u2019t think of any of them who don\u2019t have a story at some point in their life. And most of them have more than one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: I don\u2019t know how old your daughters are, but how do you deal with them living in this world where even they, whatever ages they are, can\u2019t escape this in the headlines? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: You just have to raise children with, like, self-esteem, because you\u2019re not going to be there to make all of their decisions for them. And you have to just hope that they have enough self-respect to make the best decisions they can. I mean, the Harvey situation is particularly horrible, because, you know, those women \u2014 when you say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s take a meeting in a hotel room.\u201d I mean, we auditioned, you know, for \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d in a hotel room. Like, it\u2019s common to take meetings in a hotel room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this is the most powerful man in the movie business at the time, like in the \u201990s, like Harvey was. That was the place to be. And if you get a thing from your agent on the letterhead of your agency that says, \u201cGo meet Harvey Weinstein, the rainmaker, the guy that makes these great movies, at the Peninsula Hotel,\u201d you\u2019re going to that meeting \u2026 You don\u2019t go into that meeting thinking something bad is going to happen to you \u2026 I don\u2019t know who\u2019s taking meetings in hotel rooms now. I mean, sometimes you\u2019re in a different city and you just don\u2019t have anywhere to meet. But, so no matter how smart my daughters are, no matter how prepared they are, there\u2019s still those situations that that\u2019s the nightmare kind of scenario. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Play NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: Do you worry about your daughters less because of the change in the industry? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: With social media, you know, and a Twitter account, you have the same platform as The New York Times now, so there aren\u2019t secrets. It\u2019s harder to do this type of thing. I would like to point out, though, that even though it feels like there\u2019s this avalanche of men \u2026 Well here\u2019s my optimistic spin, this is like 1 percent of the guys who are losing their careers. It\u2019s not everybody. It just feels like it. There\u2019s so many great men and women in the movie business. So many great people. It\u2019s such a wonderful collection of people overall. And these rotten horrible apples are getting weeded out right now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s progress. But again, when we go back to talking about our own growth and development as human beings. We have to get to a place where we\u2019re looking at one end of the spectrum and saying, \u201cWell, let\u2019s deal with this with some reflection and dialogue and some reconciliation, and let\u2019s all grow together and move on.\u201d And then I\u2019ll think we\u2019ll be making progress.

In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved \u201ca spectrum of behaviour\u201d. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damon said there was \u201ca difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that society was in a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and said it was \u201cwonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it\u2019s totally necessary\u201d. But he said: \u201cWe live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we\u2019re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, \u2018Wait a minute.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cGosh it\u2019s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women\u2019s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver\u2019s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: \u201cThere are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it\u2019s still cancer.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: \u201cI felt I desperately needed to say something. I\u2019ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can\u2019t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it\u2019s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver\u2019s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat\u2019s the sign of somebody who \u2013 well, we can work with that,\u201d Damon said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know Louis CK. I\u2019ve never met him. I\u2019m a fan of his, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he\u2019s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... \u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me that he thinks that because he didn\u2019t rape somebody \u2013 so far as we know \u2013 that what he did do wasn\u2019t as bad.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women.

Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat\u2019s a problem,\u201d Driver continued. \u201cIf good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we\u2019re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,\u201d she said. \u201cPut abuse in there \u2026 that all abuse is equal but some is worse.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She added: \u201cThere is no hierarchy of abuse \u2013 that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn\u2019t want or ask for \u2026 you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAnd it certainly can\u2019t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency.

Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere is not a woman I know,\u201d Driver said, \u201cmyself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn\u2019t sleep with.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIn the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,\u201d she said, \u201cI feel that\u2019s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cMen can rally and they can support, but I don\u2019t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse. Ever.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\nPassage 3:\nMatt Damon addressed the sexual allegations against Harvey Weinstein, saying, \u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t want him married to anyone close to me.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interested in Harvey Weinstein? Add Harvey Weinstein as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Harvey Weinstein news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cBut that was the extent of what we knew. I mean, and that wasn\u2019t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that \u2014 I mean, look at the guy. Of course he\u2019s a womanizer,\u201d Damon continued in an interview for ABC News\u2019 \u201cPopcorn With Peter Travers.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damon, who stars in the upcoming film \u201cDownsizing,\u201d worked with Weinstein on his Oscar-winning film \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d which was produced by Weinstein\u2019s production company Miramax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past year, several women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Weinstein has acknowledged inappropriate behavior but has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAny allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,\u201d his spokesman previously said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a wide-ranging discussion with Travers on Tuesday, Damon opened up about Weinstein and others inside and outside the entertainment world who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read part of Damon\u2019s conversation with Travers below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maryellen McGrath/ABC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Travers: We live now in a different age, in a political age. There\u2019s a lot of dissidence that goes on in the world that could affect you as an actor. We\u2019re also in the age of people charged with sexual misconduct. This is everywhere. How do you react to that? Especially you, as the father of four girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Matt Damon: I think we\u2019re in this watershed moment. I think it\u2019s great. I think it\u2019s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories, and it\u2019s totally necessary \u2026 I do believe that there\u2019s a spectrum of behavior, right? And we\u2019re going to have to figure \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated, right? You know, we see somebody like Al Franken, right? \u2014 I personally would have preferred if they had an Ethics Committee investigation, you know what I mean? It\u2019s like at what point \u2014 you know, we\u2019re so energized to kind of get retribution, I think. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And we live in this culture of outrage and injury, and, you know, that we\u2019re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, \u201cWait a minute. None of us came here perfect.\u201d You know what I mean? \u2026 The Louis C.K. thing, I don\u2019t know all the details. I don\u2019t do deep dives on this, but I did see his statement, which kind of, which [was] arresting to me. When he came out and said, \u201cI did this. I did these things. These women are all telling the truth.\u201d And I just remember thinking, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the sign of somebody who \u2014 well, we can work with that\u201d \u2026 Like, when I\u2019m raising my kids, this constant personal responsibility is as important as anything else they learn before they go off in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the fear for me is that right now, we\u2019re in this moment where at the moment \u2014 and I hope it doesn\u2019t stay this way \u2014 the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it. Because if you take responsibility for what you did, your life\u2019s going to get ruined \u2026 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I mean, look, as I said, all of that behavior needs to be confronted, but there is a continuum. And on this end of the continuum where you have rape and child molestation or whatever, you know, that\u2019s prison. Right? And that\u2019s what needs to happen. OK? And then we can talk about rehabilitation and everything else. That\u2019s criminal behavior, and it needs to be dealt with that way. The other stuff is just kind of shameful and gross, and I just think \u2026 I don\u2019t know Louis C.K.. I\u2019ve never met him. I\u2019m a fan of his, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he\u2019s paid at this point is so beyond anything that he \u2014 I just think that we have to kind of start delineating between what these behaviors are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: It\u2019s harder, isn\u2019t it, though, when you actually know someone who gets accused? We both know Harvey Weinstein. I\u2019ve worked with him. But I didn\u2019t see any of this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: When you see Al Franken taking a picture putting his hands on that woman\u2019s flak jacket and mugging for the camera, going like that, you know, that is just like a terrible joke, and it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s wrong, and he shouldn\u2019t have done that \u2026 But when you talk about Harvey and what he\u2019s accused of, there are no pictures of that. He knew he was up to no good. There\u2019s no witnesses. There\u2019s no pictures. There\u2019s no braggadocio \u2026 So they don\u2019t belong in the same category. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: I think it becomes for all of us, too, that are in any way around it, even though we\u2019re not seeing it, is, what\u2019s our responsibility to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: A lot of people said, \u2018Well, Harvey \u2014 everybody knew.\u2019 As you were saying, that\u2019s not true. Everybody knew what kind of guy he was in the sense that if you took a meeting with him, you knew that he was tough and he was a bully, and that was his reputation. And he enjoyed that reputation, because he was making the best movies out there \u2026 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [With regard to the rape allegations,] nobody who made movies for him knew \u2026 Any human being would have put a stop to that, no matter who he was. They would\u2019ve said absolutely no. You know what I mean? \u2026 I knew I wouldn\u2019t want him married to anyone close to me. But that was the extent of what we knew, you know? And that wasn\u2019t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that \u2014 I mean, look at the guy. Of course he\u2019s a womanizer \u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t hang out with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: But you can\u2019t live his life for him. Or be responsible for his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: Right. So the question is, at what point does somebody\u2019s behavior that you have a professional relationship with \u2026 away from the profession bother enough that you don\u2019t want to work with them? For me, I\u2019ve always kind of, you know, as long as nobody\u2019s committing a crime \u2014 well, that\u2019s your life, and you go live it. I don\u2019t need to be spending time with you, away from my professional life, at least. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maryellen McGrath/ABC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: [We\u2019ve seen] Ridley Scott, who directed you in \u201cThe Martian,\u201d having to erase Kevin Spacey from \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d and having to replace him with Christopher Plummer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: That was smart. That was a total business decision by Ridley. I haven\u2019t talked to him, but \u2026 it wasn\u2019t a creative choice for Ridley. Ridley has a big movie coming out \u2026 and nobody right now is in the mood to see a Kevin Spacey movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I think he\u2019s right about that. He\u2019s one of the few directors who could just turn on a dime and shoot for a week a month before a movie comes out and, you know, expunge an actor. And I don\u2019t disagree with his decision to do that. I mean, that movie, I think, will do much better without Kevin in it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Editor\u2019s note: In response to the allegations against him made by Anthony Rapp, Kevin Spacey released a statement on Oct. 29, saying, in part, \u201cI\u2019m beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter \u2026 But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\u201d In November a spokesperson for Spacey said he was \u201ctaking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.\u201d] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: When it\u2019s in that gray area and it\u2019s friends of yours or people that you do know, do you try to talk to them afterwards and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Can I help?\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: It depends on what the accusation is. It depends what\u2019s going on. If it\u2019s a friend of mine, I\u2019m always talking to them. I know the real story if it\u2019s my friend. If it\u2019s a colleague \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 I guess it depends on the situation and the allegation and how believable I think it is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: We\u2019re going to see the change in the making of movies now with people being so aware. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: I also think the day of the confidentiality agreements is over. I think it\u2019s just completely over. Ten years ago, you made a claim against me and I had a big movie coming out, OK? I have $100 million or I have a movie that is personally important to me coming out, and close to the release of that film, you say, \u201cMatt Damon grabbed my butt and stuck his tongue down my throat.\u201d We would then go to mediation and organize a settlement. I\u2019d go, \u201cI don\u2019t want this out there. Peter\u2019s going to go out and talk to the press and run his mouth, and it\u2019s going to be overshadowing the opening of this movie. How much money do you want?\u201d The lawyers would get together, and they do this cost-benefit analysis, and they\u2019d go, \u201cOh, this is what it\u2019s worth.\u201d And I look at the number and go, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll pay it, but you can never talk about this again. You\u2019re f------ lying about this, but never talk about this again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now \u2026 with social media, these stories get \u2014 it\u2019s like they get gasoline poured on them. So the moment a claim is made, if you make that same claim today to me, I would be scorched earth. I\u2019d go, \u201cI don\u2019t care if it costs $10 million to fight this in court with you for 10 years, you are not taking my name from me. You are not taking my name and my reputation from me. I\u2019ve worked too hard for it. And I earned it. You can\u2019t just blow me up like that.\u201d So I think once a claim is made, there will no longer be settlements. That\u2019s just my prediction, I mean, just based on what I\u2019ve seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: Isn\u2019t that a good thing? Women have been doing it, and they\u2019ve been told they can\u2019t express what happened to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: One hundred percent \u2026 I think that it\u2019s important, especially in that, you know, we believe every woman who\u2019s coming forward with one of these stories needs to be listened to and heard. I think one of the surprising things for me has been the extent to which my female friends, as, I think, of all the ones I\u2019ve talked to in the last year since all this stuff started happening \u2014 I can\u2019t think of any of them who don\u2019t have a story at some point in their life. And most of them have more than one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: I don\u2019t know how old your daughters are, but how do you deal with them living in this world where even they, whatever ages they are, can\u2019t escape this in the headlines? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: You just have to raise children with, like, self-esteem, because you\u2019re not going to be there to make all of their decisions for them. And you have to just hope that they have enough self-respect to make the best decisions they can. I mean, the Harvey situation is particularly horrible, because, you know, those women \u2014 when you say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s take a meeting in a hotel room.\u201d I mean, we auditioned, you know, for \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d in a hotel room. Like, it\u2019s common to take meetings in a hotel room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this is the most powerful man in the movie business at the time, like in the \u201990s, like Harvey was. That was the place to be. And if you get a thing from your agent on the letterhead of your agency that says, \u201cGo meet Harvey Weinstein, the rainmaker, the guy that makes these great movies, at the Peninsula Hotel,\u201d you\u2019re going to that meeting \u2026 You don\u2019t go into that meeting thinking something bad is going to happen to you \u2026 I don\u2019t know who\u2019s taking meetings in hotel rooms now. I mean, sometimes you\u2019re in a different city and you just don\u2019t have anywhere to meet. But, so no matter how smart my daughters are, no matter how prepared they are, there\u2019s still those situations that that\u2019s the nightmare kind of scenario. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Play NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: Do you worry about your daughters less because of the change in the industry? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: With social media, you know, and a Twitter account, you have the same platform as The New York Times now, so there aren\u2019t secrets. It\u2019s harder to do this type of thing. I would like to point out, though, that even though it feels like there\u2019s this avalanche of men \u2026 Well here\u2019s my optimistic spin, this is like 1 percent of the guys who are losing their careers. It\u2019s not everybody. It just feels like it. There\u2019s so many great men and women in the movie business. So many great people. It\u2019s such a wonderful collection of people overall. And these rotten horrible apples are getting weeded out right now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s progress. But again, when we go back to talking about our own growth and development as human beings. We have to get to a place where we\u2019re looking at one end of the spectrum and saying, \u201cWell, let\u2019s deal with this with some reflection and dialogue and some reconciliation, and let\u2019s all grow together and move on.\u201d And then I\u2019ll think we\u2019ll be making progress.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nAfter calling it Project Natal for more than a year, Microsoft finally gives its motion-control system a real name, formally unveiling Kinect during a special Cirque du Soleil performance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official product shot of Kinect, formally known as Project Natal, the new motion-control system from Microsoft. The company showed it off Sunday night in a special performance in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LOS ANGELES--After more than a year of speculation, we finally know what Microsoft's new motion-control system is called. For those that have referred to it for a year as Project Natal, meet Kinect for Xbox 360. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Sunday night, at the University of Southern California's Galen Center here, and during a special performance by Cirque du Soleil, Microsoft finally and formally pulled back the wraps on its much-anticipated system, now known as Kinect, but originally the work of the Israeli company 3DV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After sitting through (actually standing, as the press was placed on the floor of the arena for a couple of hours with no seats) the performance, in which the Cirque's performers acted out and demonstrated a number of ways that Kinect can be used, my first impression is that Microsoft has hit on something with some serious potential. But at least as demonstrated Sunday, that potential hasn't been fully realized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was tempting to think that Microsoft was taking Kinect a little too seriously during the performance, given the scale and scope of the event (more on that in a bit), but it's clear that the company has a system on its hands that it plans to incorporate widely across its video gaming and digital living room environments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while it's too soon to tell exactly how Kinect will be used, and what software is being developed for it--Microsoft will say a lot more Monday morning at its formal E3 press conference--one thing became clear Sunday night: with Kinect, and a sports game, and an exercise game for it, Microsoft is, among other things, putting Nintendo and its Wii, its Balance Board, its Wii Fit and Wii Sports squarely in its sights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clever entrance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After waiting in line for more than an hour, the thousands of people on hand for the Sunday night event were ushered inside the Galen Center. While we didn't know what was in store, we were first taken through mock living rooms, where \"normal\" American families greeted us. We didn't get to sit down, however, but were clearly being led to see how Kinect, nee Project Natal, is an integral part of the living room experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Everyone was then given a white poncho, with large shoulder pads, and awhile into the Cirque's performance, I looked around the arena and had a definite sense of being part of some sort of religious revival, what with thousands of people sitting and standing together, all wearing identical shimmering white ponchos. No individuality here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the performance finally began, a loud, all-encompassing voice boomed out of speakers and began spelling out homilies, among them that history was about to be rewritten and that for the first time, human beings would be in control and that the machines are going to have to adapt to us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"After 5 million years of evolution,\" the voice boomed, \"might the next step be the absence of an object?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR High on the walls of the arena were large digital screens, and these became the place where we were able to really see what Kinect is all about. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Far up one wall, a \"real\" living room was placed, and there, a \"family\" of mom and dad, brother and sister took turns playing all kinds of games and other experiences for Kinect. While not naming any of these games, it was clear that Microsoft was previewing what it would be showing off tomorrow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, a giant, glowing Xbox symbol rose out of the stage where the Cirque du Soleil performers were doing their thing. And on top of this stood one of the kids, who raised his arms and began to show how Kinect would mirror his movements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The kid yelled out, \"What's your name?\" And the disembodied system responded, with letters jumbled on a screen and then placed in order, \"Kinect.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Credit: Microsoft) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few minutes later, we saw how by walking in front of a Kinect system, your body movement is matched by that of an avatar on the screen. Then we saw how you can wave your arms to flip the pages of a large \"book, \"which in this case was used to embed photos Kinect was taking of the family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Game time NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And now it was time to play some games. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standing in front of the Kinect system, the young boy began miming out the movements for a river rafting game, and high on the walls, on digital representations of giant TVs, we saw his avatar riding a raft, dipping and weaving his way down a river of rapids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon, the raft morphed into a platform of sorts riding on rails and here, we saw one of the directions Microsoft and its developer partners are clearly going with Kinect: to score points, the kid had to wave his arms around in order to get his avatar to do the same and accurately hit a series of targets coming at him on different parts of the screen. If a target was high and to his left, that's where he had to put his arms. Low and right? He had to put his arms there. And so on. This looked pretty cool, and was definitely one of the things that showed the device's potential. It made me feel a little bit like it was Disneyland's Jungle Cruise on crack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next up was a driving game, and not surprisingly, controlling the vehicle by miming a steering wheel with your hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The game itself looked kind of cool, and at one point, as the car vaulted high into the air on the screen, it slowed down and took on freedom of movement in 360 degrees, and was able to totally change direction and aim at a different set of targets. And then it became a flying car, with wings, which was being controlled by both the \"brother\" and the \"sister,\" each standing on one of the \"wings.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then it was time for a \"Star Wars\" scene, and the avatar belonging to \"dad\" suddenly had a light saber in his hands, and \"dad\" was able to control it with nothing but his hands. First he was fending off Stormtroopers, and then, of course, it was time to battle Darth Vader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was all well and good for the kids and for men, but what about women? Well, then it was time for a yoga scene, and sure enough, Microsoft showed how Kinect can be used for a stylish yoga regimen, with the user's avatar almost exactly mirroring her body motions. How exactly that will work in consumer software is not entirely clear to me, but I'm sure we'll see on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By now I was seeing some of the strategy, and understanding how Microsoft seemed to be showing glimpses of its versions of the games and hardware that helped Nintendo's Wii become such a hit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The yoga demonstration and the flying car, for example, seemed to be aimed at Nintendo's Balance Board. And then we saw a big multi-sports competition game, in which the family faced off in sports like Hurdles (jumping), javelin (throwing), bowling, beach volleyball, soccer and the 100-meter sprint. This was Wii Sports writ for Kinect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was also a dancing game, in which the performers showed how it was necessary to mimic an on-screen avatar's moves precisely in order to get points--turning most of what we'd seen so far on its head, of course, in that the humans were now following the avatar, rather than the reverse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then, it was over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obviously, Sunday night's event wasn't meant to unveil specifics about the kinds of games that will be available when Kinect ships, likely this fall. That will come Monday, with Microsoft's press conference. Nor did Microsoft talk pricing Sunday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But what it did was issue a clear challenge, both to Nintendo and its hugely popular Wii system, and to Sony, which is also working on its own motion control system, known until now as Move. Sony will likely be showing a lot more about Move--including perhaps another brand name--with its own press conference on Tuesday. And Nintendo, too, will be showing off its goods on Tuesday. So one has to wonder how it and Sony will answer Microsoft's challenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My takeaway from Sunday night, as I alluded to above, is that Microsoft definitely thinks it has a game-changer with Kinect. And I surely see the potential. I hope that it will be showing a lot more on Monday, because with what we saw Sunday night, I'm impressed, but not all that much so. It was the sign of a nice addition to the motion controller wars, but not yet anything that completely upends things. And mainly that's because nothing Microsoft showed Sunday night was all that much of a surprise. We've known about Project Natal for more than a year. This all seemed like obvious directions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That might change on Monday, but unless it does, I'd have to say that Microsoft is going to have to work very hard in the coming months to live up to how seriously it is taking itself with Kinect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On June 24, CNET News reporter Daniel Terdiman and his Geek Gestalt blog will kick off Road Trip 2010. After driving more than 18,000 miles in the Rocky Mountains, the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest and the Southeast over the last four years, I'll be looking for the best in technology, science, military, nature, aviation and more throughout the American northeast. If you have a suggestion for someplace to visit, drop me a line. In the meantime, you can follow my preparations for the project on Twitter @GreeterDan and @RoadTrip.\nPassage 2:\nMaybe it was the Cirque du Soleil acrobats dancing to taiko drums, the 9-foot tall elephant puppet or the ponchos with illuminating shoulder pads for audience members, but Microsoft\u2019s much-anticipated Project Natal preview was a cross between a gospel revival and a Las Vegas show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the event was short on news, Microsoft did unveil a new name \u2014 Kinect \u2014 for Project Natal, the motion technology that lets users play videogames and interact with the Xbox 360 console with gestures and spoken commands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sunday night event, which kicked off the E3 Expo videogame industry tradeshow, was meant to be a way for audience members to get a sneak peek at Kinect. The details about pricing and availability are expected to be unveiled at its Monday press conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kinect is seen as Microsoft\u2019s answer to Nintendo Co.\u2019s Wii, which popularized game play. However, unlike the Wii, Kinect doesn\u2019t require a controller at all and, according to Microsoft, it can recognize a wider range of motion and even differentiate voices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Audience members were handed white silk ponchos with shoulder pads upon entering the University of Southern California basketball arena. In order to reach the event, certain audience members were told to walk into one of many fake living rooms where a family greeted them and pointed the way to the main stage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once there, hundreds of audience members, all wearing the white silky robes, milled about the floor of the arena until the show started. In one corner, a family sat on a sofa suspended about 50 feet in the air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Declaring that \u201chistory is about to be rewritten,\u201d the show started off with Cirque acrobats, dressed prehistorically, forming a procession with Japanese taiko drums beating in the background. Then a boy rode in on what appeared to be a mechanical elephant with a screen on the side. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once he reached the stage, the boy demonstrated the evolution from playing games with a controller to playing games with motion as the audience oohed and aahed. The final step revealed the boy standing on a giant black ball with a neon-green \u201cX,\u201d the Xbox logo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rest of the show was a parade of games, which the boy and \u201chis family\u201d demonstrated in a model living room, which occasionally rotated 360 degrees. There were also moments where the family would be playing with Kinect while what appeared to be a young girl walked upside down on the ceiling above them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the games previewed by Microsoft was whitewater rafting and a racing game, as well as virtual Tai Chi and a preview of a Star Wars game that lets players fight Darth Vader with a light saber. There was also a collection of sports games that lets players jump hurdles, run sprints, play volleyball, kick a soccer ball and bowl. Another let you train and play with a virtual tiger cub. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show ended with a grand finale demo of many different families playing dancing games where they learn various steps and moves with the help of a virtual instructor.

That will come Monday, with Microsoft's press conference. Nor did Microsoft talk pricing Sunday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But what it did was issue a clear challenge, both to Nintendo and its hugely popular Wii system, and to Sony, which is also working on its own motion control system, known until now as Move. Sony will likely be showing a lot more about Move--including perhaps another brand name--with its own press conference on Tuesday. And Nintendo, too, will be showing off its goods on Tuesday. So one has to wonder how it and Sony will answer Microsoft's challenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My takeaway from Sunday night, as I alluded to above, is that Microsoft definitely thinks it has a game-changer with Kinect. And I surely see the potential. I hope that it will be showing a lot more on Monday, because with what we saw Sunday night, I'm impressed, but not all that much so. It was the sign of a nice addition to the motion controller wars, but not yet anything that completely upends things. And mainly that's because nothing Microsoft showed Sunday night was all that much of a surprise. We've known about Project Natal for more than a year. This all seemed like obvious directions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That might change on Monday, but unless it does, I'd have to say that Microsoft is going to have to work very hard in the coming months to live up to how seriously it is taking itself with Kinect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On June 24, CNET News reporter Daniel Terdiman and his Geek Gestalt blog will kick off Road Trip 2010. After driving more than 18,000 miles in the Rocky Mountains, the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest and the Southeast over the last four years, I'll be looking for the best in technology, science, military, nature, aviation and more throughout the American northeast. If you have a suggestion for someplace to visit, drop me a line. In the meantime, you can follow my preparations for the project on Twitter @GreeterDan and @RoadTrip.\nPassage 2:\nMaybe it was the Cirque du Soleil acrobats dancing to taiko drums, the 9-foot tall elephant puppet or the ponchos with illuminating shoulder pads for audience members, but Microsoft\u2019s much-anticipated Project Natal preview was a cross between a gospel revival and a Las Vegas show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the event was short on news, Microsoft did unveil a new name \u2014 Kinect \u2014 for Project Natal, the motion technology that lets users play videogames and interact with the Xbox 360 console with gestures and spoken commands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sunday night event, which kicked off the E3 Expo videogame industry tradeshow, was meant to be a way for audience members to get a sneak peek at Kinect. The details about pricing and availability are expected to be unveiled at its Monday press conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kinect is seen as Microsoft\u2019s answer to Nintendo Co.\u2019s Wii, which popularized game play. However, unlike the Wii, Kinect doesn\u2019t require a controller at all and, according to Microsoft, it can recognize a wider range of motion and even differentiate voices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Audience members were handed white silk ponchos with shoulder pads upon entering the University of Southern California basketball arena. In order to reach the event, certain audience members were told to walk into one of many fake living rooms where a family greeted them and pointed the way to the main stage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once there, hundreds of audience members, all wearing the white silky robes, milled about the floor of the arena until the show started. In one corner, a family sat on a sofa suspended about 50 feet in the air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Declaring that \u201chistory is about to be rewritten,\u201d the show started off with Cirque acrobats, dressed prehistorically, forming a procession with Japanese taiko drums beating in the background. Then a boy rode in on what appeared to be a mechanical elephant with a screen on the side. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once he reached the stage, the boy demonstrated the evolution from playing games with a controller to playing games with motion as the audience oohed and aahed. The final step revealed the boy standing on a giant black ball with a neon-green \u201cX,\u201d the Xbox logo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rest of the show was a parade of games, which the boy and \u201chis family\u201d demonstrated in a model living room, which occasionally rotated 360 degrees. There were also moments where the family would be playing with Kinect while what appeared to be a young girl walked upside down on the ceiling above them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the games previewed by Microsoft was whitewater rafting and a racing game, as well as virtual Tai Chi and a preview of a Star Wars game that lets players fight Darth Vader with a light saber. There was also a collection of sports games that lets players jump hurdles, run sprints, play volleyball, kick a soccer ball and bowl. Another let you train and play with a virtual tiger cub. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show ended with a grand finale demo of many different families playing dancing games where they learn various steps and moves with the help of a virtual instructor.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kinect Adventures NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR River rafting with multiple players that move their bodies in the raft. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dance Central NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A dance-em-up game made by MTV Games. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Along with Kinect games using Disney and Star Wars characters, there were also dashboard apps showing motion controls used to interact with Netflix.

After walking through a set of fake living rooms, the white-poncho-wearing audience was treated to a performance by Cirque du Soleil acrobats dressed as cavemen, as a narrator declared that \u201chistory is about to rewritten\u201d and a boy, raising his arms, used his movements usher in the new motion-based way to play games, according to the Wall Street Journal. And what was this grand historical event all about? Well, mostly mimicking the Wii, according to CNET.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But 15 years after he was arrested at his remote cabin outside Lincoln, Mont., his twisted words seem to be worth less than his ratty sweatshirt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Marshall's office is currently holding an online auction of the personal effects of Ted Kaczynski, who, between 1978 and 1995, engaged in a mail bombing spree, killing three people and injuring 23 others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 68-year-old terrorist is currently serving a life sentence at a federal prison in Florence, Colo. The auction of his belongings ends June 2 and all the money raised will be used to pay off a $15 million restitution order to his victims and their families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since Kaczynski's actions were designed to protest modern society's \"industrial-technological system,\" there aren't nearly enough possessions on the auction block to raise $15 million, especially because his most valuable possession -- the cabin he built in the Montana wilderness -- is now on display in the Washington, D.C. Newseum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, at least two items are getting some serious bids: His 35,000 word handwritten manifesto currently has a bid of $17,525, while the iconic hoodie made famous by the artistic rendering in the FBI's \"Wanted\" poster is up to $20,025 -- though for that price, the successful bidder will also receive a pair of sunglasses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another item attracting interest is Kaczynski's Smith-Corona typewriter. Bids for that are currently around the $11,000 mark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story continues below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other items have attracted less attention. The top bid for a hand-bowed wood saw that Kaczynski used is currently only $310, while handwritten letters to his Aunt Frida are only getting bids around $250. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, some people might say it's a sad sign of the times that the auction is even taking place, and you won't get an argument from art historian and appraiser Elyse Luray, who is best known for her work on the PBS series \"History Detectives.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But she still believes there is value to be found in the auction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I hate to say it, but there is some collectibility in this auction,\" Luray told AOL Weird News. \"This is one of the most tragic events in U.S. history and the manifesto has historical value as does the typewriter that he used to type his two manifestos. You have to take the emotion out of it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Luray dismisses most of what is being sold, figuring it is only going to be of value to \"some weird who wants something belonging to the Unabomber.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, she can see why something as mundane as Kaczynski's hand saw might be selling for much more than its actually worth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Hype increases value,\" she said. \"On the other hand, things like Marilyn Monroe's dresses or Liz Taylor's jewelry will retain value over the years.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, crime memorabilia collectors like Scott Michaels think there is a lot of value in being able to tell friends and neighbors that the saw they are borrowing was once used by the Unabomber. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michaels is the proprietor of Dearly Departed Tours, a company that shows crime aficionados visiting Los Angeles all the city's most infamous crime-oriented sights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Michaels is also a collector who has in his possession some extraordinary pieces of macabre memorabilia, including a piece of John Denver's plane, a hunk of the Hindenberg, and a tile from the swimming pool where Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones drowned. He also owns a clown painting made by serial killer John Wayne Gacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michaels makes no bones about his hobby (unless, of course, he chooses to buy one for his collection), but admits he often has to defend it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is history I choose to embrace,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I don't understand why people collect coins. You know, this is more common than people want to admit.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That hoodie is iconic,\" he said. \"It really is the 'tah-dah' item, but the documents are interesting too.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet if he were to bid on an item himself, Michaels knows which one he'd choose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'd gravitate towards the saw,\" Michaels said. \"I like the human touch, knowing that he probably used it. I remember when they were doing a Marilyn Monroe auction. I never could have afforded the dresses, but I did purchase some golf course pencils that were stuck in her junk drawer.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sadly, Michaels doesn't have the room in his house to hold his entire collection.

Spacey issued a statement saying he was \"beyond horrified\" to hear the accusation, insisting he didn't remember the encounter but apologizing to Rapp. In the same statement, he came out as gay for the first time in public, infuriating gay rights advocates who viewed his acknowledgment as a false conflation of homosexuality with pedophilia in an attempt to distract attention from the underlying accusation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Within minutes, wordlessly, he was up and all over me,\" Holtzman, now a 64-year-old marketing consultant, recalled. \"The aggression was certainly more than a grope.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was the look on his face that was really shocking and then scary,\" Holtzman said. \"The anger was undeserved.

If confirmed, his case would be the first under police investigation in America. And as the most recent, it could potentially lead to criminal charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 15. Andy Holtmzan: In 1981, the NYU grad was working at The Public Theater in New York when Spacey, then 22 and an up-and-coming actor with a minor role in their production of Henry IV, Part 1, committed what he termed a \"wordless assault.\" Holtzman told USA TODAY he was on a phone call when Spacey began his attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Within minutes, wordlessly, he was up and all over me,\" Holtzman, now a 64-year-old marketing consultant, recalled. \"The aggression was certainly more than a grope. When I was finally able to push him off and scream (at him), he theatrically stepped back, incredibly angry, grabbed his coat and bag, stormed out and slammed the door.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holtzman said the encounter, which happened when he was 27, left him more stunned than traumatized. He was gay and comfortable with his sexuality but said he wasn't interested in Spacey, who was then in the closet. He couldn't fathom why the actor would do such a thing to him and then react the way he did when he was rebuffed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was the look on his face that was really shocking and then scary,\" Holtzman said. \"The anger was undeserved. If you ask for something and get a no, then I can understand the anger, but you ask for nothing and then try to take everything? Where is that anger coming from?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you have ever experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct while working in the entertainment industry, we\u2019d like to hear from you.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former news anchor says Spacey assaulted her son NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heather Unruh, a former TV news anchor in Boston, said in a press conference Wednesday that the Oscar-winning actor assaulted her son, who was 18 at the time. Holding back tears, Unruh said in July 2016 that Spacey stuck his hand in her son\u2019s pants and on his genitals at a bar in Nantucket, Mass. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unruh said her son told Spacey he was of legal age to drink, and \"Spacey bought him drink after drink after drink and when my son was drunk, Spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She continued, saying Spacey urged her intoxicated son to go to a private after-party to continue drinking, but a concerned bystander asked her son if he was OK. When he relayed that he was not, Unruh said the woman told her son to run and he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nothing could\u2019ve prepared my son for how that sexual assault would make him feel as a man,\" she said. \"It harmed him and it cannot be undone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unruh said her son filed a police report last week and provided evidence to Nantucket police. She says a criminal investigation was opened, though the Nantucket Police Department declined to confirm that to USA TODAY, citing Massachusetts law forbidding it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tara Miltimore , assistant district attorney and spokeswoman for the Cape & Islands District Attorney's Office, confirmed to USA TODAY that \"an individual has provided information to the Nantucket Police regarding an allegation of an indecent assault and battery.\" She said the state statute of limitations for indecent assault and battery is six years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unruh said her son did not report the encounter to police because he was embarrassed and fearful. Now, she said, her son is \"committed to doing what he can to stop Kevin Spacey from victimizing anyone else.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also had a message for the actor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"To Kevin Spacey I want to say this: Shame on you for what you did to my son and shame on you for using your apology to Anthony Rapp to come out as a gay man,\" she said. \"That was an appalling attempt to distract attention away from what you really are: a sexual predator. Your actions are criminal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unruh appeared with attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who has represented victims of clergy sexual abuse, at a downtown Boston hotel. Garabedian, who also has represented an accuser of Bill Cosby, was portrayed in the Oscar-winning film, Spotlight, about The Boston Globe's investigation of clergy sexual abuse in the Boston Catholic archdiocese. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The civil claim against Kevin Spacey happened in Massachusetts and is well within the civil statute of limitations,\" Garabedian said. \"It is also within the criminal statute of limitations. I am informed that my client did speak to the Nantucket police department and they are conducting an investigation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spacey's reps did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment. Spacey issued a statement on Twitter following Rapp's allegations, saying he was \"beyond horrified\" and insisting he didn't remember the encounter. In the same statement, he came out as gay for the first time in public.
