{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nAdam's apple\nThe laryngeal prominence (commonly referred to as Adam's apple), a feature of the human neck, is the lump or protrusion that is formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx.\n\nStructure\n\nThe structure of the laryngeal prominence forms a bump under the skin. It is larger in adult men, in whom it is usually clearly visible and palpable. In women, the bump is much less visible and is hardly perceived on the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. \n\nThe meeting point of the two portions of the cartilage generally forms an acute angle (of about 90\u00b0) in men, while in women it forms an open arc (of about 120\u00b0).\n\nSex difference\n\nAlthough both sexes have it, the Adam's apple is considered to be a characteristic feature of adult men, because its size tends to increase considerably during puberty. \n\nIts development is considered a secondary sexual characteristic of males that appears as a result of hormonal activity. Its level of development varies among individuals and the widening of that area in the larynx can occur very suddenly and quickly.\n\nThe laryngeal prominence is more prominent in adult males than in females because of the difference in the size of the angle: 90\u00b0 in males and 120\u00b0 in females.\n\nFunction \n\nThe Adam's apple, in conjunction with the thyroid cartilage which forms it, helps to protect the walls and the frontal part of the larynx, including the vocal cords (which are located directly behind it). It is found in both women and men.\n\nAnother function of the laryngeal prominence is related to the deepening of the voice. During adolescence, the thyroid cartilage grows together with the larynx. Consequently, the laryngeal prominence grows in size mainly in men. Together, a larger soundboard is made up in phonation apparatus and, as a result, the man gets a deeper voice note.  \n\nSociety and culture\n\nCosmetic surgery to reduce the size of laryngeal prominence is called chondrolaryngoplasty (thyroid chondroplasty).  The surgery is effective, such that complications tend to be few and, if present, transient. \n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThere are two main theories as to the origin of the term \"Adam's apple\". \nThe \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" and the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary point at an ancient belief that a piece of forbidden fruit was embedded in Adam's throat (the first man, according to Abrahamic religions).  However, neither the Bible nor other Judeo-Christian Islamic writings mention such a story. In fact, the biblical story does not even specify the type of fruit that Adam ate. \n\nLinguist Alexander Gode claimed that the Latin phrase to designate the laryngeal prominence was very probably translated incorrectly from the beginning. The phrase in Latin was \"pomum Adami\" (literally: 'Adam's apple'). This, in turn, came from the Hebrew \"tappuach ha adam\" meaning \"apple of man\". The confusion lies in the fact that in Hebrew language the proper name \"Adam\" (\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd) literally means \"man\", while the late Hebrew word used to refer  \"bump\" is very similar to the word used to refer \"apple\".   Proponents of this version contend that the subsequent phrases in Latin and other Romance languages represent a mistranslation from the start. \n\nThe medical term \"prominentia laryngea\" was introduced by the Basle Nomina Anatomica in 1895. \n\nIn the American South, goozle is used colloquially to describe the Adam's apple, likely derived from guzzle.    \n\nAdditional images\n\nFile:Slide9lll.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nFile:Slide5mmm.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nFile:Slide7ooo.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nQuestion:\nWhat is the common name for the laryngeal prominence in the body?\nAnswer:\nAdams Apple\nPassage:\nUranophobia\nFear of heaven, also known by its Greek-derived name uranophobia or ouranophobia, is a phobia that makes its sufferer fear heaven or the sky. \n\nThe origin of the word urano is Greek, meaning heaven, while phobia is Greek for fear.\n\nCauses\n\nThe causes of Uranophobia, as with other phobias, can be linked to a combination of external events and internal susceptibility - of brain chemistry and life experiences.\n\nFear of heaven may more specifically be related to the dread of punishment in the afterlife.

The work was scored for a small chamber orchestra and was performed in 1917.\n\nAs El sombrero de tres picos\n\nSergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes, saw the premiere of El corregidor y la molinera and commissioned Falla to rewrite it. The outcome was a two-act ballet scored for large orchestra called The Three-Cornered Hat (El sombrero de tres picos). This was first performed in London at the Alhambra Theatre on 22 July 1919. Sets and costumes were created by Pablo Picasso. Choreography was by L\u00e9onide Massine. Diaghilev asked Falla to conduct the premiere but the composer felt he was not experienced enough to conduct a work so complex and he handed the baton to Ernest Ansermet after one rehearsal. \nSynopsis \n\nAct One \n\nAfter a short fanfare the curtain rises revealing a mill in Andalusia. The miller is trying to teach a pet blackbird to tell the time. He tells the bird to chirp twice, but instead it chirps three times. Annoyed, the miller scolds the bird and tells it to try again. The  bird now chirps four times. The miller gets angry at the bird again and his wife offers it a grape. The bird takes the grape and chirps twice. The miller and his wife laugh over this and continue their work. \n\nSoon the magistrate, his wife, and their bodyguard pass by, taking their daily walk. The procession goes by and the couple returns to their work. The dandified, but lecherous, magistrate is heard coming back. The miller tells his wife that he will hide and that they will play a trick on the magistrate. \n\nThe miller hides and the magistrate sees the miller's wife dancing. After her dance she offers him some grapes. When the magistrate gets the grapes the miller's wife runs away with the magistrate following her. Finally he catches her, and the miller jumps out of a bush with a stick. The miller chases the magistrate away and the miller and his wife continue working.\n\nAct Two \n\nThat night, guests are at the miller's house. The miller dances to entertain them. His dance is interrupted by the magistrate's bodyguard, who has come to arrest him on trumped-up charges. After the miller is taken away, the guests leave one by one. The miller's wife goes to sleep and soon the magistrate comes to the mill. On his way to the door the magistrate trips and falls in the river. The miller's wife wakes up and runs away. \n\nThe magistrate undresses and hangs his clothes on a tree and goes to sleep in the miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison and sees the magistrate in his bed. The miller thinks that the magistrate is sleeping with his wife and plans to switch clothes with the magistrate and avenge himself by seducing the magistrate's wife. The miller leaves, dressed as the magistrate, and the magistrate soon wakes up. He goes outside and sees that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes. The bodyguard comes and sees the magistrate dressed as the miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller comes back and sees his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. The magistrate explains the entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing the magistrate up and down in a blanket.\n\nThe Music \n\nThroughout the ballet Falla uses traditional Andalusian folk music. The two songs sung by the mezzo-soprano are examples of cante jondo singing; this typically accompanies flamenco music and tells a sad story. At one point he quotes the opening of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. \n\nRecordings \n\nThere are many recordings of the complete ballet, as well as of the suites extracted from it. In the early 1960s Ernest Ansermet, the original conductor of the work, recorded it in stereo for London Records (aka Decca). The music was played by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the cante-jondo soloist was Teresa Berganza. It has also been recorded by such conductors as Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos, and Leonard Bernstein has recorded the two suites from the ballet with the New York Philharmonic.\n\nThe original pantomime El corregidor y la molinera has been recorded by Josep Pons and Orquestra del Teatro Lliure for Harmonia Mundi.\n\nFilm versions \n\nThe Paris Opera Ballet has recently issued a performance of the complete ballet on a DVD entitled Picasso and Dance. The performance uses not only Massine's original choreography, but actual reproductions of Picasso's sets and costumes. It is, so far, the only performance of the ballet issued on video.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the music for the ballet 'The Three-Cornered Hat'?\nAnswer:\nManuel de Fallas\nPassage:\nArctic Circle\nThe Arctic Circle is the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic, and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone. North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon); this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Circle.\n\nThe position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed; as of , it runs  north of the Equator.  Its latitude depends on the Earth's axial tilt, which fluctuates within a margin of 2\u00b0 over a 40,000-year period, due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon.  Consequently, the Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about 15 m per year.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe word \"arctic\" comes from the Greek word \u1f00\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (arktikos: \"near the Bear, northern\")  and that from the word \u1f04\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (arktos: \"bear\").  The name refers either to the constellation Ursa Major, the \"Great Bear\", which is prominent in the northern portion of the celestial sphere, or to the constellation Ursa Minor, the \"Little Bear\", which contains Polaris, the Pole star, also known as the North Star. \n\nMidnight sun and polar night\n\nThe Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for twenty-four hours; as a result, at least once each year at any location within the Arctic Circle the sun is visible at local midnight, and at least once it is not visible at local noon.  \n\nDirectly on the Arctic Circle these events occur, in principle, exactly once per year: at the June and December solstices, respectively. However, because of atmospheric refraction and mirages, and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50 minutes (\u2032) (90 km) south of the Arctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the northern winter solstice, part of the sun may be seen up to about 50\u2032 north of the Arctic Circle. That is true at sea level; those limits increase with elevation above sea level, although in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the true horizon.\n\nHuman habitation\n\nRelatively few people live north of the Arctic Circle due to the severe climate; nonetheless, some areas have been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. Tens of thousands of years ago, waves of people migrated from eastern Siberia across the Bering Strait into North America and gradually eastward to settle. Much later, in the historic period, there has been migration into some Arctic areas by Europeans and other immigrants.\n\nThe largest communities north of the Arctic Circle are situated in Russia and Norway: Murmansk (population 307,257), Norilsk (175,365), Troms\u00f8 (71,295) and Vorkuta (70,548). Rovaniemi (61,329) in Finland is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic Circle lying slightly south of the line.\n\nIn contrast, the largest North American community north of the Arctic Circle, Sisimiut (Greenland), has approximately 5,000 inhabitants. Of the Canadian and United States Arctic communities, Barrow, Alaska is the largest settlement with about 4,000 inhabitants.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Arctic Circle is roughly  long.  (A different source says . ) The area north of the Circle is about  and covers roughly 4% of Earth's surface. \n\nThe Arctic Circle passes through the Arctic Ocean, the Scandinavian Peninsula, North Asia, Northern America and Greenland. The land within the Arctic Circle is divided among eight countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland (where it passes through the small offshore island of Gr\u00edmsey).\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long. In the interior, summers can be quite warm, while winters are extremely cold. For example, summer temperatures in Norilsk (Russia) will sometimes reach as high as 30 C, while the winter temperatures frequently fall below .\n\nSites along the Arctic Circle\n\nStarting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards, the Arctic Circle passes through:\nQuestion:\nWhich is the largest city within the Arctic Circle?\nAnswer:\nMurmansk\nPassage:\nWhat a Country!\nWhat a Country! is an American sitcom that aired in syndication from September 27, 1986 to May 23, 1987.

The outcome was a two-act ballet scored for large orchestra called The Three-Cornered Hat (El sombrero de tres picos). This was first performed in London at the Alhambra Theatre on 22 July 1919. Sets and costumes were created by Pablo Picasso. Choreography was by L\u00e9onide Massine. Diaghilev asked Falla to conduct the premiere but the composer felt he was not experienced enough to conduct a work so complex and he handed the baton to Ernest Ansermet after one rehearsal. \nSynopsis \n\nAct One \n\nAfter a short fanfare the curtain rises revealing a mill in Andalusia. The miller is trying to teach a pet blackbird to tell the time. He tells the bird to chirp twice, but instead it chirps three times. Annoyed, the miller scolds the bird and tells it to try again. The  bird now chirps four times. The miller gets angry at the bird again and his wife offers it a grape. The bird takes the grape and chirps twice. The miller and his wife laugh over this and continue their work. \n\nSoon the magistrate, his wife, and their bodyguard pass by, taking their daily walk. The procession goes by and the couple returns to their work. The dandified, but lecherous, magistrate is heard coming back. The miller tells his wife that he will hide and that they will play a trick on the magistrate. \n\nThe miller hides and the magistrate sees the miller's wife dancing. After her dance she offers him some grapes. When the magistrate gets the grapes the miller's wife runs away with the magistrate following her. Finally he catches her, and the miller jumps out of a bush with a stick. The miller chases the magistrate away and the miller and his wife continue working.\n\nAct Two \n\nThat night, guests are at the miller's house. The miller dances to entertain them. His dance is interrupted by the magistrate's bodyguard, who has come to arrest him on trumped-up charges. After the miller is taken away, the guests leave one by one. The miller's wife goes to sleep and soon the magistrate comes to the mill. On his way to the door the magistrate trips and falls in the river. The miller's wife wakes up and runs away. \n\nThe magistrate undresses and hangs his clothes on a tree and goes to sleep in the miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison and sees the magistrate in his bed. The miller thinks that the magistrate is sleeping with his wife and plans to switch clothes with the magistrate and avenge himself by seducing the magistrate's wife. The miller leaves, dressed as the magistrate, and the magistrate soon wakes up. He goes outside and sees that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes. The bodyguard comes and sees the magistrate dressed as the miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller comes back and sees his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. The magistrate explains the entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing the magistrate up and down in a blanket.\n\nThe Music \n\nThroughout the ballet Falla uses traditional Andalusian folk music. The two songs sung by the mezzo-soprano are examples of cante jondo singing; this typically accompanies flamenco music and tells a sad story. At one point he quotes the opening of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. \n\nRecordings \n\nThere are many recordings of the complete ballet, as well as of the suites extracted from it. In the early 1960s Ernest Ansermet, the original conductor of the work, recorded it in stereo for London Records (aka Decca). The music was played by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the cante-jondo soloist was Teresa Berganza. It has also been recorded by such conductors as Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos, and Leonard Bernstein has recorded the two suites from the ballet with the New York Philharmonic.\n\nThe original pantomime El corregidor y la molinera has been recorded by Josep Pons and Orquestra del Teatro Lliure for Harmonia Mundi.\n\nFilm versions \n\nThe Paris Opera Ballet has recently issued a performance of the complete ballet on a DVD entitled Picasso and Dance. The performance uses not only Massine's original choreography, but actual reproductions of Picasso's sets and costumes. It is, so far, the only performance of the ballet issued on video.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the music for the ballet 'The Three-Cornered Hat'?\nAnswer:\nManuel de Fallas\nPassage:\nArctic Circle\nThe Arctic Circle is the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic, and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone. North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon); this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Circle.\n\nThe position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed; as of , it runs  north of the Equator.  Its latitude depends on the Earth's axial tilt, which fluctuates within a margin of 2\u00b0 over a 40,000-year period, due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon.  Consequently, the Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about 15 m per year.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe word \"arctic\" comes from the Greek word \u1f00\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (arktikos: \"near the Bear, northern\")  and that from the word \u1f04\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (arktos: \"bear\").  The name refers either to the constellation Ursa Major, the \"Great Bear\", which is prominent in the northern portion of the celestial sphere, or to the constellation Ursa Minor, the \"Little Bear\", which contains Polaris, the Pole star, also known as the North Star. \n\nMidnight sun and polar night\n\nThe Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for twenty-four hours; as a result, at least once each year at any location within the Arctic Circle the sun is visible at local midnight, and at least once it is not visible at local noon.  \n\nDirectly on the Arctic Circle these events occur, in principle, exactly once per year: at the June and December solstices, respectively. However, because of atmospheric refraction and mirages, and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50 minutes (\u2032) (90 km) south of the Arctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the northern winter solstice, part of the sun may be seen up to about 50\u2032 north of the Arctic Circle. That is true at sea level; those limits increase with elevation above sea level, although in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the true horizon.\n\nHuman habitation\n\nRelatively few people live north of the Arctic Circle due to the severe climate; nonetheless, some areas have been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. Tens of thousands of years ago, waves of people migrated from eastern Siberia across the Bering Strait into North America and gradually eastward to settle. Much later, in the historic period, there has been migration into some Arctic areas by Europeans and other immigrants.\n\nThe largest communities north of the Arctic Circle are situated in Russia and Norway: Murmansk (population 307,257), Norilsk (175,365), Troms\u00f8 (71,295) and Vorkuta (70,548). Rovaniemi (61,329) in Finland is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic Circle lying slightly south of the line.\n\nIn contrast, the largest North American community north of the Arctic Circle, Sisimiut (Greenland), has approximately 5,000 inhabitants. Of the Canadian and United States Arctic communities, Barrow, Alaska is the largest settlement with about 4,000 inhabitants.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Arctic Circle is roughly  long.  (A different source says . ) The area north of the Circle is about  and covers roughly 4% of Earth's surface. \n\nThe Arctic Circle passes through the Arctic Ocean, the Scandinavian Peninsula, North Asia, Northern America and Greenland. The land within the Arctic Circle is divided among eight countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland (where it passes through the small offshore island of Gr\u00edmsey).\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long. In the interior, summers can be quite warm, while winters are extremely cold. For example, summer temperatures in Norilsk (Russia) will sometimes reach as high as 30 C, while the winter temperatures frequently fall below .\n\nSites along the Arctic Circle\n\nStarting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards, the Arctic Circle passes through:\nQuestion:\nWhich is the largest city within the Arctic Circle?\nAnswer:\nMurmansk\nPassage:\nWhat a Country!\nWhat a Country! is an American sitcom that aired in syndication from September 27, 1986 to May 23, 1987.

It was in his Menlo Park laboratory that Thomas Edison invented both the phonograph and a commercially viable incandescent light bulb filament. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first street in the world to use electric lights for illumination.  The Menlo Park lab has been called one of the greatest laboratories ever.  Edison left Menlo Park and moved his home and laboratory to West Orange in 1887.  After his death, the Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum was constructed near his old Menlo Park lab and dedicated in 1938.

The author of works like The Raven and the The Black Cat was found in a confused state on the streets of Baltimore in October 1849 and died in a city hospital a few days later at the age of 40.\nA life-size replica of Poe's body went on display in a pine casket at the Poe House in Baltimore on October 7 for visitors to pay their respects, according to Jeff Jerome, curator of the Poe Museum.\n\"This actually is the bicentennial of Poe's birth and there was very little we could do with the birth so we thought we would recreate Poe's funeral since his original funeral was very quick.

It began broadcasting in June 1940 during World War II, with the intention of helping the war effort. It was perceived that the productivity of manual labour could be raised by offering a non-stop medley of popular music played at an even tempo, to accompany the working day in factories. For a certain period, a recorded version was rebroadcast in the late evening, to entertain night-shift workers. After the war, the broadcasts continued on the newly-formed BBC Light Programme.\nMusic While You Work was discontinued in 1967 when most Light Programme offerings were transitioned to BBC Radio 2. However, it was revived in the 1980s; initially for one week to mark the BBC's 60th anniversary in October 1982 and then as a regular part of the Radio 2 schedules from January 1983 to January 1984\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWhich radio programme used 'Calling All Workers' as its theme tune?\nAnswer:\nMusic While You Work\nPassage:\nPhlebitis\nPhlebitis or venitis is the inflammation of a vein, usually in the legs. It most commonly occurs in superficial veins. Phlebitis often occurs in conjunction with thrombosis and is then called \"thrombophlebitis\" or \"superficial thrombophlebitis\". Unlike deep vein thrombosis, the probability that superficial thrombophlebitis will cause a clot to break up and be transported in pieces to the lung is very low. \n\nSigns and symptoms\n\n* Localized redness and swelling\n* Pain or burning along the length of the vein \n* Vein being hard and cord-like \n\nCause\n\nPhlebitis is typically caused by local trauma to a vein, usually from the insertion of an intravenous catheter.  However, phlebitis can also occur due to a complication of connective tissue disorders such as lupus, or of pancreatic, breast, or ovarian cancers. Phlebitis can also result from certain medications and drugs that irritate the veins, such as desomorphine. \n\nSuperficial phlebitis often presents as an early sign in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), a vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins in distal extremities often associated with cigarette smoking. \n\nManagement\n\nTreatment usually consists of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and local compression (e.g., by compression stockings or a compress).

During 2007, he played an unexpected role in the international arbitration hearing that eventually decided American cyclist Floyd Landis should forfeit his 2006 Tour de France title due to testing that found abnormally high levels of testosterone. LeMond testified that he had spoken with Landis after his \"A\" urine sample had tested positive, urging him that if his \"B\" sample was also positive, he should come clean, help his sport, and \"more importantly, help himself.\" Before his testimony, LeMond had been threatened by Landis' manager.\nThe doping problem has been most public in the Tour de France - two stage winners of the 2007 Tour withdrew from the race amid doping allegations - but its influence is so pervasive that T-Mobile recently withdrew its sponsorship of a professional cycling team, stating that the company did not want to associate its brand with doping. - Santa Clara University\nGreg LeMond is a former professional road bicycle racer from the United States and a three time winner of the Tour de France in 1986, 1989, and 1990.\nGwen Knapp is a staff writer for the sports section of the San Francisco Chronicle.\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWith which sport would you associate Greg Le Mond?\nAnswer:\nCyclist\nPassage:\nPiculet\nThe piculets are a distinctive subfamily of small woodpeckers which occur mainly in tropical South America, with just three Asian and one African  species.\n\nLike the true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues which they use to extract their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, but they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.\n\nTheir bills are shorter and less dagger-like than  the true woodpeckers, so they look for insects and grubs mainly in decaying wood. Similarly, they re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.\n\nTypically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.\n\nSystematics and evolution\n\nAlthough not well known from fossils, the evolution of piculets is now considered rather straightforward. The disjunct occurrence of the genera, with one African species of the Southeast Asian Sasia and one Southeast Asian species of the American Picumnus is of comparatively recent origin. Molecular dating, calibrated with geographic events in the absence of a good fossil record, points at the Late Miocene, c. 8 MYA, as the point where the two genera divided into their two respective lineages. At that time, there was a notable global cooling period. The molecular distances between piculets and woodpeckers are comparatively small for subfamilies, agreeing with the hypothesis that the split between the three groups of woodpecker-like picids subfamilies occurred only during the Miocene climate optimum, around 15 MYA. The later radiation of South American piculets is probably due to changes in topology and climate fluctuations during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The genus Verreauxia may be accepted because of pronounced morphological similarities, but the two Picumnus lineages, despite having diverged long ago, are virtually alike except for head coloration (Fuchs et al., 2006).\n\nThe Antillean piculet (Nesoctites micromegas) has proven to be a very distinct species evolutionarily between piculets and woodpeckers (Benz et al., 2006) and thus is nowadays placed in a subfamily of its own.\n\nThe arrangement of species in the genera follows del Hoyo et al. (2002).\n\nGenus Picumnus\n* Speckled piculet,  Picumnus innominatus (sometimes Vivia)\n* Bar-breasted piculet,  Picumnus aurifrons\n* Orinoco piculet,  Picumnus pumilus\n* Lafresnaye's piculet,  Picumnus lafresnayi\n* Golden-spangled piculet,  Picumnus exilis\n* Black-spotted piculet,  Picumnus nigropunctatus\n* Ecuadorian piculet,  Picumnus sclateri\n* Scaled piculet,  Picumnus squamulatus\n* White-bellied piculet,  Picumnus spilogaster\n* Arrowhead piculet,  Picumnus minutissimus\n* Spotted piculet,  Picumnus pygmaeus\n* Speckle-chested piculet,  Picumnus steindachneri\n* Varzea piculet,  Picumnus varzeae\n* White-barred piculet,  Picumnus cirratus\n* Ocellated piculet,  Picumnus dorbygnianus\n* Ochre-collared piculet,  Picumnus temminckii\n* White-wedged piculet,  Picumnus albosquamatus\n* Rusty-necked piculet,  Picumnus fuscus\n* Rufous-breasted piculet,  Picumnus rufiventris\n* Tawny piculet,  Picumnus fulvescens\n* Ochraceous piculet,  Picumnus limae\n* Mottled piculet,  Picumnus nebulosus\n* Plain-breasted piculet,  Picumnus castelnau\n* Fine-barred piculet,  Picumnus subtilis\n* Olivaceous piculet,  Picumnus olivaceus\n* Greyish piculet,  Picumnus granadensis\n* Chestnut piculet,  Picumnus cinnamomeus\n\nGenus Verreauxia (sometimes included in Sasia)\n* African piculet,  Verreauxia africana\n\nGenus Sasia\n* Rufous piculet,  Sasia abnormis\n* White-browed piculet,  Sasia ochracea\nQuestion:\nA piculet is which type of creature?\nAnswer:\nAvians\nPassage:\nLoch Ness\nLoch Ness (; ,) is a large, deep, freshwater loch in the Scottish Highlands extending for approximately 37 km southwest of Inverness. Its surface is 52 ft above sea level. Loch Ness is best known for alleged sightings of the cryptozoological Loch Ness Monster, also known affectionately as \"Nessie\". It is connected at the southern end by the River Oich and a section of the Caledonian Canal to Loch Oich. At the northern end there is the Bona Narrows which opens out into Loch Dochfour, which feeds the River Ness and a further section of canal to Inverness. It is one of a series of interconnected, murky bodies of water in Scotland; its water visibility is exceptionally low due to a high peat content in the surrounding soil.\n\nLoch Ness is the second largest Scottish loch by surface area at 56 sqkm after Loch Lomond, but due to its great depth, it is the largest by volume in the British Isles. Its deepest point is 755 ft,   making it the second deepest loch in Scotland after Loch Morar. A 2016 survey claimed to have discovered a crevice that pushed the depth to 889 ft but further research determined it to be a sonar anomaly.    It contains more fresh water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined, and is the largest body of water on the Great Glen Fault, which runs from Inverness in the north to Fort William in the south.\n\nVillages and places\n\nAt Drumnadrochit is the \"Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition\"  which examines the natural history and legend of Loch Ness. Boat cruises operate from various locations on the loch shore, giving visitors the chance to look for the \"monster\".\n\nUrquhart Castle is located on the western shore, 1 mi east of Drumnadrochit.\n\nLighthouses are located at Lochend (Bona Lighthouse) and Fort Augustus.\n\nMonster\n\nLoch Ness is thought by some to be the home of the Loch Ness Monster (also known as \"Nessie\"), a cryptid, reputedly a large unknown animal. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. Popular interest and belief in the animal's existence has varied since it was first brought to the world's attention in 1933. \n\nFish species\n\nThe following fish species are native to Loch Ness. A number of others such as perch and roach have been introduced in the Loch or Caledonian Canal with various levels of success. \n\nIsland \n\nThe only island on Loch Ness is Cherry Island, visible at its southwestern end, near Fort Augustus. It is a crannog, which is a form of artificial island. Most crannogs were constructed during the Iron Age.\n\nThere was formerly a second island (Dog Island) which was submerged when the water level was raised during the construction of the Caledonian Canal.\n\nHydroelectricity\n\nLoch Ness serves as the lower storage reservoir for the Foyers pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme, which was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The turbines were originally used to provide power for a nearby aluminium smelting plant, but now electricity is generated and supplied to the National Grid. Another scheme, the 100 MW Glendoe Hydro Scheme near Fort Augustus, began generation in June 2009 producing 76 gigawatt hours in its first months of operation, It was out of service between 2009 and 2012 for repair of the tunnels connecting the reservoir to the turbines \n\nGeology\n\nLoch Ness lies along the Great Glen Fault, which forms a line of weakness in the rocks which has been excavated by glacial erosion, forming the Great Glen and the basins of Loch Lochy, Loch Oich and Loch Ness. \n\nImage gallery\n\nImage:Wt9 schleuse3 augustus locks.jpg|Locks on Caledonian Canal in Fort Augustus, Loch Ness in the background\nImage:Loch Ness 0406.JPG|Loch Ness looking south, taken in May 2006.\nImage:Loch_Ness_Panorama.png|Sunrise over Loch Ness, taken at Urquhart Castle\nImage:Loch_Ness_Panoramin_July_2008.JPG|Loch Ness panorama from a ship in 2008\n\nLoch Ness records\n\nJohn Cobb died in an attempt at the water speed record when his boat Crusader struck an unexplained wake on the surface of the loch in 1952. His accident was recorded by the BBC reporters on site at the time.  Nearby, there is a memorial to him erected by the people of Glenurquhart\n\nOn 31 August 1974, David Scott Munro, of Ross-shire Caberfeidh Water Ski Club, became the first person in the world to water ski (mono ski) the length of Loch Ness. From Lochend to Fort Augustus and back, he covered the 48 miles in 77 minutes at an average speed of 37 mph. \n\nBrenda Sherratt was the first person to swim  along the length of Loch Ness in Scotland in 31 hours and 27 minutes in July 1966.\nQuestion:\nWhich canal joins Loch Ness to the Moray Firth\nAnswer:\nCaledonian Canal Commissioners\nPassage:\nPishon\nThe Pishon ( P\u00ee\u0161\u014dn) is one of four rivers (along with Hiddekel (Tigris), Phrath (Euphrates) and Gihon) mentioned in the Biblical Book of Genesis. In that passage, these rivers are described as arising within the Garden of Eden. The Pishon is described as encircling \"the entire land of Havilah.\" \n\nIdentification \n\nUnlike the Tigris and the Euphrates, the Pishon has never been clearly located. It is briefly mentioned together with the Tigris in the Wisdom of Sirach (24:25), but this reference throws no more light on the location of the river. The Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus, in the beginning of his Antiquities of the Jews (1st century AD) identified the Pishon with the Ganges.  The medieval French rabbi Rashi identified it with the Nile.\n\nSome early modern scholars, including A.D. Calumet (1672\u20131757), Rosenm\u00fcller (1768\u20131835), and Kell (1807\u20131888), believed the source river [for Eden] was a region of springs: \"The Pishon and Gihon were mountain streams.  The former may have been the Phasis or Araxes, and the latter the Oxus.\" \nJames A. Sauer, former curator of the Harvard Semitic Museum, made an argument from geology and history that Pishon referred to what is now the Wadi Bisha, a dry channel which begins in the Hijaz Mountains near Medina to run northeast to Kuwait.  With the aid of satellite photos, Farouk El-Baz of Boston University traced the dry channel from Kuwait up the Wadi Al-Batin and the Wadi Al-Rummah system originating near Medina. \n\nDavid Rohl identified Pishon with the Uizhun, placing Havilah to the northeast of Mesopotamia. The Uizhun is known locally as the Golden River. Rising near Mt. Sahand, it meanders between ancient gold mines and lodes of lapis lazuli before feeding the Caspian Sea. Such natural resources correspond to the ones associated with the land of Havilah in Genesis.\nQuestion:\nAccording to the Old Testament, which place is the source of the river that divides into four other rivers - the Pishon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates?\nAnswer:\nEden (Bible)\nPassage:\nBlue Cross (animal charity)\nBlue Cross is a registered animal welfare charity  in the United Kingdom, founded in 1897 as Our Dumb Friends League.  The charity provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership.\n\nThe charity works closely with a number of other organizations to promote animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.\n\nHistory\n\nThe organisation was founded on 10 May 1897 in London as Our Dumb Friends League, to care for working horses on the streets of the British capital.  It opened its first animal hospital, in Victoria, London, on 15 May 1906.\n\nIn 1912, the league launched The Blue Cross Fund to care for horses during the Balkan War. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, it was quickly reopened again. By the armistice in 1918, the Blue Cross Fund had raised nearly \u00a3170,000 \u2013 the equivalent of almost \u00a36.5 million today \u2013 to care for the animals of conflict. Over 50,000 horses were treated in Blue Cross hospitals in France, and the charity had sent vital veterinary supplies to 3,500 units of the British Army. \n\nDonations to the Fund enabled the charity to care for more than 350,000 animals during the Second World War, many of who were wounded during the Blitz. \nThe name of the appeal fund became more widely known than the official charity title and the league officially changed its name to \"The Blue Cross\" in 1950. In 2011 the charity dropped \"The\" from its name and is now simply known as \"Blue Cross.\"\n\nSally de la Bedoyere became the charity\u2019s CEO in November 2014. \n\nOperations\n\nBlue Cross operates a number of services throughout the United Kingdom.  Its major services are: rehoming unwanted animals, providing veterinary services to pet owners who cannot afford the private fees charged by private veterinary surgeons, promoting animal welfare through education, and operating the Pet Bereavement Support Service, a free and confidential support line for those who have lost a pet.  They also operate a horse ambulance service, including at large equestrian events.\n\nBlue Cross operates four animal hospitals, three of which are in London, at Victoria, Merton and Hammersmith, and a fourth in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, as well as running mobile clinics throughout the country. In 2014 it opened a pet care clinic in Derby.   Blue Cross carried out over 97,000 treatments, operations and diagnostic investigations in 2010.\n\nBlue Cross is also heavily involved in animal adoption, arranging adoption for companion animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits and small rodents, as well as larger species such as horses.   In 2013, the charity rehomed 8,191 animals. \n\nThe organisation also works to improve the lives of animals through promotion to pet owners and work in animal behaviour therapy. Every pet owner that rehomes a pet through the charity can benefit from free behaviour advice for the pet\u2019s lifetime. The Pet Bereavement Support Service is available 365 days a year to help people who are struggling to cope with the loss of a pet.\n\nProposed closure of two animal centres\n\nOn 26 January 2010, Blue Cross announced the proposed closure of the two animal adoption centres (Felixstowe and Northiam, East Sussex), both of which had been in existence for over 50 years. Final decisions on both sites were announced on 4 May 2010. After an extensive publicity campaign by locals, it was announced that plans to close the Felixstowe centre had been dropped.  The centre will relocate to a brand new site near Ipswich. Work on the purpose-built rehoming centre is due to begin in 2014. \n\nPartnerships\n\nThe Irish Blue Cross is a related party of Blue Cross.\n\nAwards\n\nMedals have been awarded by Blue Cross to animals and people who have demonstrated bravery or heroism. While the first medals were awarded to people who helped to rescue animals, medals were awarded in 1918 to honour a number of horses which had served in the First World War. Medals were then given out between 1940 and 1951 to a number of dogs, including Juliana who reportedly extinguished an incendiary bomb by urinating on it. In 2006 Jake, a police explosives dog, was given the honour after helping to clear out the London Underground after the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\nQuestion:\n\"Founded in 1897, which animal welfare charity was formerly known As \"\"Our Dumb Friends League\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nBlue Cross (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nKid Ory\nEdward \"Kid\" Ory (December 25, 1886 \u2013 January 23, 1973) was a jazz trombonist and bandleader. He was born in Woodland Plantation near La Place, Louisiana.\n\nBiography\n\nOry started playing music with home-made instruments in his childhood, and by his teens was leading a well-regarded band in Southeast Louisiana. He kept La Place, Louisiana, as his base of operations due to family obligations until his twenty-first birthday, when he moved his band to New Orleans, Louisiana. He was one of the most influential trombonists of early jazz.\n\nOry was a banjo player during his youth and it is said that his ability to play the banjo helped him develop \"tailgate\", a particular style of playing the trombone. In \"tailgate\" style the trombone plays a rhythmic line underneath the trumpets and cornets.\n\nWhile Ory was living on Jackson Avenue, he was discovered by Buddy Bolden, playing his first New trombone, instead of the old civil war trombone. But his sister said he was too young to play with Bolden.\n\nOry had one of the best-known bands in New Orleans in the 1910s, hiring many of the great jazz musicians of the city, including cornetists Joe \"King\" Oliver, Mutt Carey, and Louis Armstrong, who joined the band in 1919;  and clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone.\n\nIn 1919 he moved to Los Angeles\u2014one of a number of New Orleans musicians to do so near that time\u2014and he recorded there in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey, clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson, and string bassist Ed Garland. Garland and Carey were longtime associates who would still be playing with Ory during his 1940s comeback. While in Los Angeles Ory and his band recorded two instrumentals, \"Ory's Creole Trombone\" and \"Society Blues\", as well as a number of songs. They were the first jazz recordings made on the west coast by an African-American jazz band from New Orleans. His band recorded with the recording company Nordskog and Ory paid them for the pressings and then sold them under his own label of \"Kid Ory's Sunshine Orchestra\" at a store in Los Angeles called Spikes Brothers Music Store. In 1925, Ory moved to Chicago, where he was very active, working and recording with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and many others. He mentored Benny Goodman, and later Charles Mingus.\n\nDuring the Great Depression Ory retired from music and did not play again until 1943. From 1944 to about 1961 he led one of the top New Orleans style bands of the period. In addition to Mutt Carey and Ed Garland, trumpeters Alvin Alcorn and Teddy Buckner; clarinetists Darnell Howard, Jimmie Noone, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, and George Probert; pianists Buster Wilson, Cedric Haywood, and Don Ewell; and drummer Minor Hall were among his sidemen during this period. All but Probert, Buckner, and Ewell were originally from New Orleans.\n\nThe Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz, making popular 1940s radio broadcasts\u2014among them a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program (beginning March 15, 1944).    In 1944\u201345 the group made a series of recordings on the Crescent Records label, founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory's band. \n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Ory and his group appeared at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles.\n\nOry retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii, with the assistance of Trummy Young. Ory died in Honolulu. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. \nDiscography\n\nWith Red Allen \n*Red Allen, Kid Ory & Jack Teagarden at Newport (Verve, 1957)\nQuestion:\nWith which instrument do you associate the jazz musician Kid Ory?\nAnswer:\nHarmonic glissando\nPassage:\nnew VW Scirocco \u2013 Volkswagen UK\nScirocco : Volkswagen UK\n\u2020At the end of the agreement there are three options: i) own the vehicle: pay the optional final payment; ii) return the vehicle: subject to fair wear and tear, charges may apply; or iii) replace: part exchange the vehicle.\n1\u00a32,000 towards your deposit when purchased on Solutions PCP (excluding Scirocco base trim).\n2 Acceptance fee is not required\n3Payable with optional final payment.\nFinance subject to status. 18s and over.

Pangrams have been used to display typefaces, test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and keyboarding.\n\nThe best known English pangram is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" It has been used since at least the late 19th century, was utilized by Western Union to test Telex / TWX data communication equipment for accuracy and reliability,  and is now used by a number of computer programs (most notably the font viewer built into Microsoft Windows) to display computer fonts. An example in another language is ', containing all letters used in German , including every umlaut (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) plus the \u00df.  It has been used since before 1800.\n\nShort pangrams in English are more difficult to come up with and tend to use uncommon words. A perfect pangram contains every letter of the alphabet only once and can be considered an anagram of the alphabet; it is the shortest possible pangram.  An example is the phrase \"Cwm fjord bank glyphs vext quiz\" (', a loan word from Welsh, means a steep-sided valley, particularly in Wales). However, such examples are not usually understood even by native English speakers, and so arguably are not really English pangrams. \n\nHere are some short pangrams using standard written English, not involving abbreviations or proper nouns:\n# \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.\" (32 letters)\n# \"Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.\" (31 letters)\n# \"The five boxing wizards jump quickly.\" (31 letters)\n# \"How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!\" (30 letters)\n# \"Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.\" (29 letters)\n\nLonger pangrams may afford more opportunity for humor, cleverness, or thoughtfulness.   \n\nIn a sense, the pangram is the opposite of the lipogram, in which the aim is to omit one or more letters.\n\nLogographic scripts \n\nLogographic scripts, that is, writing systems composed principally of logograms, cannot be used to produce pangrams in the literal sense, since they are radically different from alphabets or other phonetic writing systems. In such scripts, the total number of signs is large and imprecisely defined, so producing a text with every possible sign is impossible. However, various analogies to pangrams are feasible, including traditional pangrams in a romanization. In Japanese, although typical orthography uses kanji (logograms), pangrams are required to contain every kana (syllabic character) when written out in kana alone: the Iroha is a classic example.\n\nIn addition, it is possible to create pangrams that demonstrate certain aspects of logographic characters.\n\nIn Chinese, the Thousand Character Classic is a 1000-character poem in which each character is used exactly once; however, it does not include all Chinese characters. The single character  (permanence) incorporates every basic stroke used to write Chinese characters exactly once, as described in the Eight Principles of Yong.\n\nSelf-enumerating pangrams \n\nA self-enumerating pangram is a pangrammatic autogram, or a sentence that inventories its own letters, each of which occurs at least once. The first example was produced by Rudy Kousbroek, a Dutch journalist and essayist, who publicly challenged Lee Sallows, a British recreational mathematician resident in the Netherlands, to produce an English translation of his Dutch pangram. In the sequel, Sallows built an electronic \"pangram machine\", that performed a  systematic search among millions of candidate solutions. The machine was successful in identifying the following 'magic' translation:   \nThis pangram contains four As, one B, two Cs, one D, thirty Es, six Fs, five Gs, seven Hs, eleven Is, one J, one K, two Ls, two Ms, eighteen Ns, fifteen Os, two Ps, one Q, five Rs, twenty-seven Ss, eighteen Ts, two Us, seven Vs, eight Ws, two Xs, three Ys, & one Z.\n\nChris Patuzzo, a British computer scientist was able to reduce the problem of finding a self-enumerating pangram to the Boolean satisfiability problem. He did this by using a bespoke Hardware description language as a stepping stone and then applied the Tseitin transformation to the resulting chip. \n\nPangrams in literature\n\nThe pangram \"The quick brown fox...\" and searches for a shorter pangram are the cornerstone of the plot of the novel Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn.  The search successfully comes to an end when the phrase \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs\" is discovered.\nQuestion:\nComplete the following pangram: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy what?\"\nAnswer:\ndog\nPassage:\nSWOT Analysis - What it is and how to use it\nSWOT Analysis - What it is and how to use it\nHome > Goal Setting > SWOT Analysis\nSWOT Analysis for Goal Setting\nSWOT, which stands for Strengths,     Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats, is a way to     analyze and evaluate your current situation and environment. While     it's typically used for strategic planning in business settings, it can also     be used in goal setting to help you identify goals that will give     you the most benefit. It is a way of matching your internal     capabilities, resources and liabilities with the external factors     you are facing.\nSWOT analysis works best when focused on a     particular result area .\nPerforming a SWOT Analysis\nYou start by identifying your strengths,     which represent your internal capabilities and resources in this     result area. Here are some questions you can use to help you get     started:\nWhat are your core competencies in this area?\nWhat relevant skills, talents or abilities do      you poses?\nWhat resources do you have at your disposal?\nWhat specialized knowledge or expertise do you have access      to?\nWho can you ask for advice, support or help?\nWhat special/proprietary tools can you use or develop?\nWhat is already working well in this area? What      related strengths does that reveal?\nKeep in mind that not all of these questions will     apply to every result area. Just use the ones that make sense to     help you identify your strengths.\nA SWOT analysis is essential for any goal in a              business. If you ever plan to run your own business, consider a              Business Administration degree from Anna Maria College online to learn how to do properly prepare a SWOT analysis.\nThe next step is to identify your weaknesses,     which represent your internal liabilities. In many cases, the lack of a     strength or resource can be considered a weakness. Here are some     ideas to help you identify your weaknesses:\nWhat are your main liabilities in this area?\nList all the relevant skills, abilities and      talents that you would find helpful in this result area. Which      ones are you the least good or proficient at?\nList the specialized knowledge or expertise that      you would find helpful in this result area. Any knowledge or      expertise that you lack could be considered a weakness.\nAre there any resources (money, time, help) that      you currently don't have access to?\nWhat is not working in this area right now? What      related weaknesses does that reveal?\nYour strengths and weaknesses give you     an idea of your internal capabilities, resources and liabilities.     The next step in SWOT analysis is to identify your external opportunities for profit, growth and improvement. Here are some     ideas to help you identify them:\nList the opportunities that you have been      considering.\nWhat things could you improve in this result      area?\nThink of one thing you could do that would      significantly improve your situation in this area.\nWhat important goals could you pursue?\nHow can you take advantage of your strengths?\nCan you take advantage of any changes in your      environment or circumstances?\nWhat opportunities would become available to you      if you eliminate some of your weaknesses?\nNow identify your threats, which represent     external events, environmental factors, or changes that could affect     you negatively. Here are some ideas to help you identify some     threats:\nMake a list of serious risks you are facing in      this area if you continue along your current path.\nWhat obstacles or roadblocks are impeding your      progress?\nWhat environmental factors are affecting you      negatively?\nThink about how current changes to your      environment or circumstances could affect you negatively.\nUsing SWOT Analysis to Identify Targets and     Strategies\nThe whole point of doing a SWOT analysis is to help     you identify the most beneficial targets and strategies to pursue     right now based on your current situation, and to identify     strategies that will help you prepare for the future.\nYou do this by analyzing the four quadrants of the     SWOT matrix.\nSWOT Quadrant I - Strengths/Opportunities (SO)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     take advantage of your core strengths to aggressively pursue the     best opportunities at your disposal. This is particularly important     if the opportunities are short-lived. An example would be to utilize     a temporary competitive advantage to gain market share in your     business.\nSWOT Quadrant II - Strengths/Threats (ST)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     utilize your strengths to actively eliminate or reduce threats you     are facing.\nSWOT Quadrant III-Weaknesses/Opportunities (WO)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you open up opportunities down the road by working to     reduce some of your weaknesses (or making your strengths even     stronger). You can use this quadrant to help you prepare a long-term     improvement plan.\nSWOT Quadrant IV - Weaknesses/Threats (WT)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you mitigate and avoid threats that could result from your     weaknesses. You could do this by eliminating the weaknesses and     turning them into strengths, or by developing defensive strategies     to reduce the likelihood or severity of the threat.\nSummary\nThe four SWOT quadrants provide different     perspectives to help you identify targets and strategies:\nSO Quadrant - Opportunities to Pursue\nST Quadrant - Threats to Eliminate\nWO Quadrant - Things to Improve\nWT Quadrant - Risk Mitigation & Avoidance\nOver the long term, you should include goals from     each of the four quadrants for balance. In the short term, you may     want to focus on one or two quadrants to take advantage of any     circumstances you are currently facing.\nSuccesses/Failures Analysis\nWhile SWOT analysis is a good way to examine you     current situation looking forward, it doesn't always reveal past     trends that you can learn from. A successes/failures analysis     complements the SWOT matrix and can give you more insight into your     strengths and weaknesses.\nYou start by listing all your successes and     achievements in this result area, followed by listing all your     failures or missteps. Once you've listed them, you can identify     additional strengths and weaknesses based on the trends that they     show you.\nQuestion:\nIn SWOT analysis used in business, for what does the 'S' stand?\nAnswer:\nSTRENGTHS, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats\nPassage:\nEndothermic process\nThe term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings; usually, but not always, in the form of heat. The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo-, derived from the word \"endon\" (\u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd) meaning \"within\" and the root \"therm\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc-) meaning \"hot.\" The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed. The opposite of an  endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases, \"gives out\" energy in the form of (usually, but not always) heat. Thus in each term (endothermic & exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs, though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes, without necessarily being in the form of heat.\n\nThe concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to, for example, chemical reactions, where thermal energy (heat) is converted to chemical bond energy.\n\nEndothermic (and exothermic) analysis only accounts for the enthalpy change (\u2206H) of a reaction. The full energy analysis of a reaction is the Gibbs free energy (\u2206G), which includes an entropy (\u2206S) and temperature term in addition to the enthalpy. A reaction will be a spontaneous process at a certain temperature if the products have a lower Gibbs free energy (an exergonic reaction) even if the enthalpy of the products is higher. Entropy and enthalpy are different terms, so the change in entropic energy can overcome an opposite change in enthalpic energy and make an endothermic reaction favorable.\n\nExamples\n\n* Photosynthesis\n* Melting ice\n* Evaporating liquid water\n* Sublimation of carbon dioxide (dry ice)\n* Cracking of alkanes\n* Thermal decomposition reactions\n* Electrolytic decomposition of sodium chloride into sodium hydroxide and hydrogen chloride \n* Dissolving ammonium chloride in water\n* Nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than nickel in stellar cores\n* High-energy neutrons can produce tritium from lithium-7 in an endothermic reaction, consuming 2.466 MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield.\n\n* Nuclear fusion of elements heavier than iron in supernovae\nQuestion:\nWhat is absorbed in an endothermic reaction?\nAnswer:\nHeat as energy\nPassage:\nBelgrade Theatre\nThe Belgrade Theatre is a live performance venue seating 858 and situated in Coventry, England. It was the first civic theatre to be built after the Second World War in Britain and as such was more than a place of entertainment. It joined the new Coventry Cathedral as a symbol of optimism and culture in one of the largest re-development projects then undertaken, to rebuild the city of Coventry, which had been almost totally destroyed by bombing. The building is now a grade II listed building. In 1963 the Belgrade was registered as a charity by the Charity Commission (number 219163). \nThe Belgrade acquired its name in recognition and thanks for a gift of timber from the Yugoslavian (today Serbian) capital city of Belgrade (Coventry's official sister city), that was used extensively in the construction of the auditorium. Since opening in 1958, the theatre has established itself as a centre for the new and innovative productions.\n\nHaving pioneered the Theatre-in-Education movement in the 1960s the theatre continues to work with disadvantaged young people and uses drama as a tool to develop personal and social skills. Their most successful programme \"Acting Out\" has been commissioned by Coventry's LEA for the last 10 years and has been replicated across the UK. One graduate of the course credits \"Acting Out\" with saving her life. \n\nThe theatre reopened in September 2007 after undergoing a \u00a312\u00a0million refurbishment with a 7-storey extension to provide a second auditorium.\n\nPrince Edward officially opened the refurbishment of the Belgrade's B2 studio on 5 February 2008, this also marked the 50th anniversary of the Belgrade's opening performed by Princess Alexandra.\nQuestion:\nIn which English city did the Belgrade Theatre open in 1958?\nAnswer:\nCofantre\nPassage:\nSomething Rotten\nSomething Rotten is the fourth\nbook in the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde.  It continues the story some two years after the point where The Well of Lost Plots leaves off.\n\nPlot introduction\n\nThe book sees Thursday return from the world of fiction to the alternative Swindon that Fforde introduced in The Eyre Affair; she is accompanied by Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, whose excursion from the world of fiction with Thursday forms the main sub-plot.\n\nThe title is taken from Hamlet I.iv:  \"Something is rotten in the State of Denmark\".\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947.  Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old.\n\nThursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him.  Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenberg cake, has some curious house guests:  Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos.  Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them.\n\nDespite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues.  She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the ageing English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike.\n\nThursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him.  On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\").  Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday.\n\nGoliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO\u2014at their headquarters in the Isle of Man\u2014and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness.  Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband.  Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilise. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly.\n\nOn top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy).\n\nShe succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.\nQuestion:\nWhich sport is played by the Reading Thwackers and the Swindon Mallets in the Jasper Fforde book \u2018Something Rotten\u2019?\nAnswer:\nCroquet mallet\nPassage:\nPresident George H. W. Bush - The White House | whitehouse.gov\nGeorge H. W. Bush | whitehouse.gov\nAir Force One\nGeorge H. W. Bush\nGeorge H. W. Bush, as the 41st President (1989-1993), brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States \"a kinder and gentler nation\" in the face of a dramatically changing world.\nGeorge Bush brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States \"a kinder and gentler nation.\" In his Inaugural Address he pledged in \"a moment rich with promise\" to use American strength as \"a force for good.\"\nComing from a family with a tradition of public service, George Herbert Walker Bush felt the responsibility to make his contribution both in time of war and in peace. Born in Milton, Massachusetts, on June 12, 1924, he became a student leader at Phillips Academy in Andover. On his 18th birthday he enlisted in the armed forces. The youngest pilot in the Navy when he received his wings, he flew 58 combat missions during World War II. On one mission over the Pacific as a torpedo bomber pilot he was shot down by Japanese antiaircraft fire and was rescued from the water by a U. S. submarine. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action.\nBush next turned his energies toward completing his education and raising a family. In January 1945 he married Barbara Pierce. They had six children-- George, Robin (who died as a child), John (known as Jeb), Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy.\nAt Yale University he excelled both in sports and in his studies; he was captain of the baseball team and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation Bush embarked on a career in the oil industry of West Texas.\nLike his father, Prescott Bush, who was elected a Senator from Connecticut in 1952, George became interested in public service and politics. He served two terms as a Representative to Congress from Texas. Twice he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate. Then he was appointed to a series of high-level positions: Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U. S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\nIn 1980 Bush campaigned for the Republican nomination for President. He lost, but was chosen as a running mate by Ronald Reagan. As Vice President, Bush had responsibility in several domestic areas, including Federal deregulation and anti-drug programs, and visited scores of foreign countries. In 1988 Bush won the Republican nomination for President and, with Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate, he defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the general election.\nBush faced a dramatically changing world, as the Cold War ended after 40 bitter years, the Communist empire broke up, and the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union ceased to exist; and reformist President Mikhail Gorbachev, whom Bush had supported, resigned. While Bush hailed the march of democracy, he insisted on restraint in U. S. policy toward the group of new nations.\nIn other areas of foreign policy, President Bush sent American troops into Panama to overthrow the corrupt regime of General Manuel Noriega, who was threatening the security of the canal and the Americans living there. Noriega was brought to the United States for trial as a drug trafficker.\nBush's greatest test came when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, then threatened to move into Saudi Arabia. Vowing to free Kuwait, Bush rallied the United Nations, the U. S. people, and Congress and sent 425,000 American troops. They were joined by 118,000 troops from allied nations. After weeks of air and missile bombardment, the 100-hour land battle dubbed Desert Storm routed Iraq's million-man army.\nDespite unprecedented popularity from this military and diplomatic triumph, Bush was unable to withstand discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending. In 1992 he lost his bid for reelection to Democrat William Clinton.\nThe Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from \u201cThe Presidents of the United States of America,\u201d by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey.

Six streets converge at the junction: Park Lane (from the north), Piccadilly (northeast), Constitution Hill (southeast), Grosvenor Place (south), Grosvenor Crescent (southwest) and Knightsbridge (west).\n\nHyde Park Corner tube station, a London Underground station served by the Piccadilly line, is located at the junction as well as a number of notable monuments.\n\nImmediately to the north of the junction is Apsley House, the home of the first Duke of Wellington, and several monuments to the Duke were erected in the vicinity in his lifetime and subsequently.\n\nEvolution and development \n\n \nIn the centre of the Hyde Park Corner traffic island stands the Wellington Arch (or Constitution Arch), designed by Decimus Burton and planned as a northern gate to the grounds of Buckingham Palace.  In execution, it was laid out as a gate into the Green Park and was originally sited directly opposite Burton's Ionic Screen (also known as the Hyde Park Corner Screen) which still provides a gate into Hyde Park.  Originally, the arch was topped with an equestrian statue of the Duke (by Matthew Cotes Wyatt).  \n\nBecause of traffic congestion, the arch was moved south and realigned to the axis of Constitution Hill in 1883. The boundary of Buckingham Palace's garden were moved south, and a new road named Duke of Wellington Place was created separating the space containing the arch from the rest of the Green Park. At this time the large equestrian statue was removed to Sandhurst.  It was subsequently replaced with the current work, entitled The Angel of Peace descending on the Quadriga of Victory, dated 1912, by the sculptor Adrian Jones. \n\nFollowing the passage of the Park Lane Improvement Act 1958, Park Lane was widened in the early 1960s.  For most of its length this was achieved by converting the former East Carriage Drive of Hyde Park into the northbund lanes of a dual carriageway, but at Hyde Park Corner, all lanes of traffic came together on a line immediately to the east of Apsley House that required demolition of houses on Piccadilly. This left Apsley House on an island site.  The InterContinental London hotel was subsequently built on the cleared site between the new route of Park Lane and Hamilton Place.\n\nAt part of the same scheme, a tunnel was constructed beneath the junction to allow traffic to flow freely between Knightsbridge and Piccadilly.   As a result, the area around the arch became a large traffic island, mostly laid to grass, and accessible only by pedestrian underpassess, and formally ceased to be part of the Green Park.\n\nSubsequent changes to the road layout in the 1990s reinstated a route between Hyde Park and the Green Park for pedestrians, cyclists and horseriders using surface level crossings.\n\nThe traffic island includes a smaller equestrian statue of Wellington by Edgar Boehm unveiled in 1888, the Machine Gun Corps Memorial, the Royal Artillery Memorial, the Australian War Memorial and the New Zealand War Memorial. \n\nOther monuments in the vicinity of Hyde Park Corner include  Adrian Jones's Monument to the Cavalry of the Empire (off the west side of Park Lane),  Alexander Munro's Boy and Dolphin statue (in a rose garden parallel to Rotten Row, going west from Hyde Park Corner), the Queen Elizabeth Gate (behind Apsley House), the Wellington Monument (off the west side of Park Lane), and a statue of Lord Byron (on a traffic island opposite the Wellington Monument).\n\nThe term is often erroneously used for Speakers' Corner, which is located at the north-eastern corner of Hyde Park.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n*The 1935 film Hyde Park Corner takes its name from the area, where it is set.\n*\"Hyde Park Corner\" was used as a codeword to announce to the government the death of King George VI in 1952. \n\nGallery of memorials\n\nFile:Australian War Memorial, Hyde Park Corner - geograph.org.uk - 1463114.jpg|Australian War Memorial\nFile:Byron Statue - geograph.org.uk - 1574255.jpg|Statue of Lord Byron\nFile:Statue of the Duke of Wellington - geograph.org.uk - 397832.jpg|Equestrian Statue of the Duke of Wellington\nFile:DavidLondon.JPG|Machine Gun Corps Memorial\nFile:NZ war memorial, London.JPG|New Zealand War Memorial\nFile:Royal Artillery Memorial, outside Aspley House, London.JPG|Royal Artillery Memorial\nQuestion:\nNamed after the 16/17th century fancy collar that made a fortune for Robert Baker, which London street starts at Hyde Park Corner and ends at a famous statue ?

Anatomy of seed plants. John Wiley and Sons, New York. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of Gaultheria procumbens or Syzygium jambos. Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, with much of the fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium.  Other example could be the anthocarps specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls).\n\nFruit with fleshy seeds, such as pomegranate or mamoncillo, are not considered to be accessory fruit.\n\nThe terms false fruit, spurious fruit, and pseudocarp are older terms for accessory fruit that have been criticized as \"inapt\", and are not used by botanists today.\nQuestion:\nPseudocarp relates to which type of crop?\nAnswer:\nFruiting\n\n\nPassage:\n2009 Songs in Popular Music - Pop Culture Madness\n2009 Songs in Popular Music\n2009's Biggest Artists,              Albums and Songs\n\u266b Adele (Best New Artist            Grammy Winner) \u266b Robert Plant & Alison Krauss (Grammy for Album of the Year)\nPlease Read The Letter - Alison Krauss and Robert Plant (Grammy for            Record of the Year)\n2009's Retro Top 10 Hits\n1. \u266b Fire Burning - Sean Kingston 2. \u266b Fireflies - Owl City 3. \u266b Whatcha Say - Jason Derulo 4. \u266b Don't Stop Believin - Glee Cast 5. \u266b Chasing Pavements - Adele 6. \u266b Good Girls Gone Bad - Cobra Starship with Leighton Meester 7. \u266b Right Round - Flo Rida (with Kesha) 8. \u266b Don't Trust Me - 3OH!3 9. \u266b I Love College - Asher Roth 10. \u266b My Life Would Suck Without You - Kelly Clarkson\n2009's Dance Top 10              Hit List\n1. \u266b I Gotta Feeling - Black Eyed Peas 2. \u266b Bad Romance - Lady Gaga 3. \u266b I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho) - Pitbull 4. \u266b Just Dance - Lady Gaga 5. \u266b Evacuate The Dancefloor - Cascada 6. \u266b Boom Boom Pow - Black Eyed Peas 7. \u266b Poker Face - Lady Gaga 8. \u266b 3 - Britney Spears 9. \u266b Hotel Room Service - Pitbull 10. \u266b Heartless - Kanye West\n2009's Bubblegum 10              Hit List\n1. \u266b Party In The USA - Miley Cyrus 2. \u266b Love Story - Taylor Swift 3. \u266b Say Hey (I Love You) - Micheal Franti and Spearhead with Cherine Anderson 4. \u266b Favorite Girl - Justin Beiber 5. \u266b Fifteen - Taylor Swift 6. \u266b The Climb - Miley Cyrus 7. \u266b One Less Lonely Girl - Justin Beiber 8. \u266b Paranoid - Jonas Brothers 9. \u266b Hoedown Throwdown - Miley Cyrus 10. \u266b Jai Ho!

The author of works like The Raven and the The Black Cat was found in a confused state on the streets of Baltimore in October 1849 and died in a city hospital a few days later at the age of 40.\nA life-size replica of Poe's body went on display in a pine casket at the Poe House in Baltimore on October 7 for visitors to pay their respects, according to Jeff Jerome, curator of the Poe Museum.\n\"This actually is the bicentennial of Poe's birth and there was very little we could do with the birth so we thought we would recreate Poe's funeral since his original funeral was very quick. There were only seven people in attendance,\" Jerome told Reuters Television.\n\"I thought this would be Baltimore's chance to make it right, to do it the right way.\"\nThe casket was loaded onto an old fashioned hearse and taken through the city to Westminster Burying Ground where the writer is buried.\nMany Poe fans gathered to bid a proper farewell to the writer whose life had been a struggle as he made very little money from his writing.\nMany dressed in period costumes to join the funeral procession, some dressed as famous people who had either known Poe or had been inspired by him, such as Walt Whitman, Charles Baudelaire, and Alfred Hitchcock.\n\"Personally Edgar Allan Poe has meant so much to me as far as his creativity and originality so it is great to be here. It's a privilege to be here and honour him,\" said one Poe fan, Roger Bow, who had come from New York for the event.\nTOP\nQuestion:\nWhich author's funeral took place in Baltimore US, 160 years after his death?\nAnswer:\nEdgar alen poe\nPassage:\nClassic BBC Radio Theme ~ Music While You Work - YouTube\nClassic BBC Radio Theme ~ Music While You Work - YouTube\nClassic BBC Radio Theme ~ Music While You Work\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

It began broadcasting in June 1940 during World War II, with the intention of helping the war effort. It was perceived that the productivity of manual labour could be raised by offering a non-stop medley of popular music played at an even tempo, to accompany the working day in factories. For a certain period, a recorded version was rebroadcast in the late evening, to entertain night-shift workers. After the war, the broadcasts continued on the newly-formed BBC Light Programme.\nMusic While You Work was discontinued in 1967 when most Light Programme offerings were transitioned to BBC Radio 2. However, it was revived in the 1980s; initially for one week to mark the BBC's 60th anniversary in October 1982 and then as a regular part of the Radio 2 schedules from January 1983 to January 1984\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWhich radio programme used 'Calling All Workers' as its theme tune?\nAnswer:\nMusic While You Work\nPassage:\nPhlebitis\nPhlebitis or venitis is the inflammation of a vein, usually in the legs. It most commonly occurs in superficial veins. Phlebitis often occurs in conjunction with thrombosis and is then called \"thrombophlebitis\" or \"superficial thrombophlebitis\". Unlike deep vein thrombosis, the probability that superficial thrombophlebitis will cause a clot to break up and be transported in pieces to the lung is very low. \n\nSigns and symptoms\n\n* Localized redness and swelling\n* Pain or burning along the length of the vein \n* Vein being hard and cord-like \n\nCause\n\nPhlebitis is typically caused by local trauma to a vein, usually from the insertion of an intravenous catheter.  However, phlebitis can also occur due to a complication of connective tissue disorders such as lupus, or of pancreatic, breast, or ovarian cancers. Phlebitis can also result from certain medications and drugs that irritate the veins, such as desomorphine. \n\nSuperficial phlebitis often presents as an early sign in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), a vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins in distal extremities often associated with cigarette smoking. \n\nManagement\n\nTreatment usually consists of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and local compression (e.g., by compression stockings or a compress).  If the phlebitis is associated with local bacterial infection, antibiotics may be used. \n\nFor acute infusion superficial thrombophlebitis there is not enough evidence as of 2015 to determine treatment. \n\nHistory\n\nPhlebitis was first described by John Hunter in 1784.\nQuestion:\nWhat specific part of the body is affected by phlebitis?\nAnswer:\nVein valves\nPassage:\nGreg LeMond - How Have Steroids Changed Cycling ... - YouTube\nGreg LeMond - How Have Steroids Changed Cycling? - YouTube\nGreg LeMond - How Have Steroids Changed Cycling?\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nThe interactive transcript could not be loaded.\nLoading...\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

During 2007, he played an unexpected role in the international arbitration hearing that eventually decided American cyclist Floyd Landis should forfeit his 2006 Tour de France title due to testing that found abnormally high levels of testosterone. LeMond testified that he had spoken with Landis after his \"A\" urine sample had tested positive, urging him that if his \"B\" sample was also positive, he should come clean, help his sport, and \"more importantly, help himself.\" Before his testimony, LeMond had been threatened by Landis' manager.\nThe doping problem has been most public in the Tour de France - two stage winners of the 2007 Tour withdrew from the race amid doping allegations - but its influence is so pervasive that T-Mobile recently withdrew its sponsorship of a professional cycling team, stating that the company did not want to associate its brand with doping. - Santa Clara University\nGreg LeMond is a former professional road bicycle racer from the United States and a three time winner of the Tour de France in 1986, 1989, and 1990.\nGwen Knapp is a staff writer for the sports section of the San Francisco Chronicle.\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWith which sport would you associate Greg Le Mond?\nAnswer:\nCyclist\nPassage:\nPiculet\nThe piculets are a distinctive subfamily of small woodpeckers which occur mainly in tropical South America, with just three Asian and one African  species.\n\nLike the true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues which they use to extract their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, but they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.\n\nTheir bills are shorter and less dagger-like than  the true woodpeckers, so they look for insects and grubs mainly in decaying wood. Similarly, they re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.\n\nTypically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.\n\nSystematics and evolution\n\nAlthough not well known from fossils, the evolution of piculets is now considered rather straightforward. The disjunct occurrence of the genera, with one African species of the Southeast Asian Sasia and one Southeast Asian species of the American Picumnus is of comparatively recent origin. Molecular dating, calibrated with geographic events in the absence of a good fossil record, points at the Late Miocene, c. 8 MYA, as the point where the two genera divided into their two respective lineages. At that time, there was a notable global cooling period. The molecular distances between piculets and woodpeckers are comparatively small for subfamilies, agreeing with the hypothesis that the split between the three groups of woodpecker-like picids subfamilies occurred only during the Miocene climate optimum, around 15 MYA. The later radiation of South American piculets is probably due to changes in topology and climate fluctuations during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The genus Verreauxia may be accepted because of pronounced morphological similarities, but the two Picumnus lineages, despite having diverged long ago, are virtually alike except for head coloration (Fuchs et al., 2006).\n\nThe Antillean piculet (Nesoctites micromegas) has proven to be a very distinct species evolutionarily between piculets and woodpeckers (Benz et al., 2006) and thus is nowadays placed in a subfamily of its own.\n\nThe arrangement of species in the genera follows del Hoyo et al.

Its surface is 52 ft above sea level. Loch Ness is best known for alleged sightings of the cryptozoological Loch Ness Monster, also known affectionately as \"Nessie\". It is connected at the southern end by the River Oich and a section of the Caledonian Canal to Loch Oich. At the northern end there is the Bona Narrows which opens out into Loch Dochfour, which feeds the River Ness and a further section of canal to Inverness. It is one of a series of interconnected, murky bodies of water in Scotland; its water visibility is exceptionally low due to a high peat content in the surrounding soil.\n\nLoch Ness is the second largest Scottish loch by surface area at 56 sqkm after Loch Lomond, but due to its great depth, it is the largest by volume in the British Isles. Its deepest point is 755 ft,   making it the second deepest loch in Scotland after Loch Morar. A 2016 survey claimed to have discovered a crevice that pushed the depth to 889 ft but further research determined it to be a sonar anomaly.    It contains more fresh water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined, and is the largest body of water on the Great Glen Fault, which runs from Inverness in the north to Fort William in the south.\n\nVillages and places\n\nAt Drumnadrochit is the \"Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition\"  which examines the natural history and legend of Loch Ness. Boat cruises operate from various locations on the loch shore, giving visitors the chance to look for the \"monster\".\n\nUrquhart Castle is located on the western shore, 1 mi east of Drumnadrochit.\n\nLighthouses are located at Lochend (Bona Lighthouse) and Fort Augustus.\n\nMonster\n\nLoch Ness is thought by some to be the home of the Loch Ness Monster (also known as \"Nessie\"), a cryptid, reputedly a large unknown animal. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. Popular interest and belief in the animal's existence has varied since it was first brought to the world's attention in 1933. \n\nFish species\n\nThe following fish species are native to Loch Ness. A number of others such as perch and roach have been introduced in the Loch or Caledonian Canal with various levels of success. \n\nIsland \n\nThe only island on Loch Ness is Cherry Island, visible at its southwestern end, near Fort Augustus. It is a crannog, which is a form of artificial island. Most crannogs were constructed during the Iron Age.\n\nThere was formerly a second island (Dog Island) which was submerged when the water level was raised during the construction of the Caledonian Canal.\n\nHydroelectricity\n\nLoch Ness serves as the lower storage reservoir for the Foyers pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme, which was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The turbines were originally used to provide power for a nearby aluminium smelting plant, but now electricity is generated and supplied to the National Grid. Another scheme, the 100 MW Glendoe Hydro Scheme near Fort Augustus, began generation in June 2009 producing 76 gigawatt hours in its first months of operation, It was out of service between 2009 and 2012 for repair of the tunnels connecting the reservoir to the turbines \n\nGeology\n\nLoch Ness lies along the Great Glen Fault, which forms a line of weakness in the rocks which has been excavated by glacial erosion, forming the Great Glen and the basins of Loch Lochy, Loch Oich and Loch Ness. \n\nImage gallery\n\nImage:Wt9 schleuse3 augustus locks.jpg|Locks on Caledonian Canal in Fort Augustus, Loch Ness in the background\nImage:Loch Ness 0406.JPG|Loch Ness looking south, taken in May 2006.\nImage:Loch_Ness_Panorama.png|Sunrise over Loch Ness, taken at Urquhart Castle\nImage:Loch_Ness_Panoramin_July_2008.JPG|Loch Ness panorama from a ship in 2008\n\nLoch Ness records\n\nJohn Cobb died in an attempt at the water speed record when his boat Crusader struck an unexplained wake on the surface of the loch in 1952. His accident was recorded by the BBC reporters on site at the time.  Nearby, there is a memorial to him erected by the people of Glenurquhart\n\nOn 31 August 1974, David Scott Munro, of Ross-shire Caberfeidh Water Ski Club, became the first person in the world to water ski (mono ski) the length of Loch Ness. From Lochend to Fort Augustus and back, he covered the 48 miles in 77 minutes at an average speed of 37 mph. \n\nBrenda Sherratt was the first person to swim  along the length of Loch Ness in Scotland in 31 hours and 27 minutes in July 1966.\nQuestion:\nWhich canal joins Loch Ness to the Moray Firth\nAnswer:\nCaledonian Canal Commissioners\nPassage:\nPishon\nThe Pishon ( P\u00ee\u0161\u014dn) is one of four rivers (along with Hiddekel (Tigris), Phrath (Euphrates) and Gihon) mentioned in the Biblical Book of Genesis. In that passage, these rivers are described as arising within the Garden of Eden. The Pishon is described as encircling \"the entire land of Havilah.\" \n\nIdentification \n\nUnlike the Tigris and the Euphrates, the Pishon has never been clearly located. It is briefly mentioned together with the Tigris in the Wisdom of Sirach (24:25), but this reference throws no more light on the location of the river. The Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus, in the beginning of his Antiquities of the Jews (1st century AD) identified the Pishon with the Ganges.  The medieval French rabbi Rashi identified it with the Nile.\n\nSome early modern scholars, including A.D. Calumet (1672\u20131757), Rosenm\u00fcller (1768\u20131835), and Kell (1807\u20131888), believed the source river [for Eden] was a region of springs: \"The Pishon and Gihon were mountain streams.  The former may have been the Phasis or Araxes, and the latter the Oxus.\" \nJames A. Sauer, former curator of the Harvard Semitic Museum, made an argument from geology and history that Pishon referred to what is now the Wadi Bisha, a dry channel which begins in the Hijaz Mountains near Medina to run northeast to Kuwait.  With the aid of satellite photos, Farouk El-Baz of Boston University traced the dry channel from Kuwait up the Wadi Al-Batin and the Wadi Al-Rummah system originating near Medina. \n\nDavid Rohl identified Pishon with the Uizhun, placing Havilah to the northeast of Mesopotamia. The Uizhun is known locally as the Golden River. Rising near Mt. Sahand, it meanders between ancient gold mines and lodes of lapis lazuli before feeding the Caspian Sea. Such natural resources correspond to the ones associated with the land of Havilah in Genesis.\nQuestion:\nAccording to the Old Testament, which place is the source of the river that divides into four other rivers - the Pishon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates?\nAnswer:\nEden (Bible)\nPassage:\nBlue Cross (animal charity)\nBlue Cross is a registered animal welfare charity  in the United Kingdom, founded in 1897 as Our Dumb Friends League.  The charity provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership.\n\nThe charity works closely with a number of other organizations to promote animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.\n\nHistory\n\nThe organisation was founded on 10 May 1897 in London as Our Dumb Friends League, to care for working horses on the streets of the British capital.  It opened its first animal hospital, in Victoria, London, on 15 May 1906.\n\nIn 1912, the league launched The Blue Cross Fund to care for horses during the Balkan War. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, it was quickly reopened again. By the armistice in 1918, the Blue Cross Fund had raised nearly \u00a3170,000 \u2013 the equivalent of almost \u00a36.5 million today \u2013 to care for the animals of conflict. Over 50,000 horses were treated in Blue Cross hospitals in France, and the charity had sent vital veterinary supplies to 3,500 units of the British Army. \n\nDonations to the Fund enabled the charity to care for more than 350,000 animals during the Second World War, many of who were wounded during the Blitz. \nThe name of the appeal fund became more widely known than the official charity title and the league officially changed its name to \"The Blue Cross\" in 1950. In 2011 the charity dropped \"The\" from its name and is now simply known as \"Blue Cross.\"\n\nSally de la Bedoyere became the charity\u2019s CEO in November 2014. \n\nOperations\n\nBlue Cross operates a number of services throughout the United Kingdom.  Its major services are: rehoming unwanted animals, providing veterinary services to pet owners who cannot afford the private fees charged by private veterinary surgeons, promoting animal welfare through education, and operating the Pet Bereavement Support Service, a free and confidential support line for those who have lost a pet.  They also operate a horse ambulance service, including at large equestrian events.\n\nBlue Cross operates four animal hospitals, three of which are in London, at Victoria, Merton and Hammersmith, and a fourth in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, as well as running mobile clinics throughout the country. In 2014 it opened a pet care clinic in Derby.   Blue Cross carried out over 97,000 treatments, operations and diagnostic investigations in 2010.\n\nBlue Cross is also heavily involved in animal adoption, arranging adoption for companion animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits and small rodents, as well as larger species such as horses.   In 2013, the charity rehomed 8,191 animals. \n\nThe organisation also works to improve the lives of animals through promotion to pet owners and work in animal behaviour therapy. Every pet owner that rehomes a pet through the charity can benefit from free behaviour advice for the pet\u2019s lifetime. The Pet Bereavement Support Service is available 365 days a year to help people who are struggling to cope with the loss of a pet.\n\nProposed closure of two animal centres\n\nOn 26 January 2010, Blue Cross announced the proposed closure of the two animal adoption centres (Felixstowe and Northiam, East Sussex), both of which had been in existence for over 50 years. Final decisions on both sites were announced on 4 May 2010. After an extensive publicity campaign by locals, it was announced that plans to close the Felixstowe centre had been dropped.  The centre will relocate to a brand new site near Ipswich. Work on the purpose-built rehoming centre is due to begin in 2014. \n\nPartnerships\n\nThe Irish Blue Cross is a related party of Blue Cross.\n\nAwards\n\nMedals have been awarded by Blue Cross to animals and people who have demonstrated bravery or heroism. While the first medals were awarded to people who helped to rescue animals, medals were awarded in 1918 to honour a number of horses which had served in the First World War. Medals were then given out between 1940 and 1951 to a number of dogs, including Juliana who reportedly extinguished an incendiary bomb by urinating on it. In 2006 Jake, a police explosives dog, was given the honour after helping to clear out the London Underground after the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\nQuestion:\n\"Founded in 1897, which animal welfare charity was formerly known As \"\"Our Dumb Friends League\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nBlue Cross (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nKid Ory\nEdward \"Kid\" Ory (December 25, 1886 \u2013 January 23, 1973) was a jazz trombonist and bandleader. He was born in Woodland Plantation near La Place, Louisiana.\n\nBiography\n\nOry started playing music with home-made instruments in his childhood, and by his teens was leading a well-regarded band in Southeast Louisiana. He kept La Place, Louisiana, as his base of operations due to family obligations until his twenty-first birthday, when he moved his band to New Orleans, Louisiana. He was one of the most influential trombonists of early jazz.\n\nOry was a banjo player during his youth and it is said that his ability to play the banjo helped him develop \"tailgate\", a particular style of playing the trombone. In \"tailgate\" style the trombone plays a rhythmic line underneath the trumpets and cornets.\n\nWhile Ory was living on Jackson Avenue, he was discovered by Buddy Bolden, playing his first New trombone, instead of the old civil war trombone. But his sister said he was too young to play with Bolden.\n\nOry had one of the best-known bands in New Orleans in the 1910s, hiring many of the great jazz musicians of the city, including cornetists Joe \"King\" Oliver, Mutt Carey, and Louis Armstrong, who joined the band in 1919;  and clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone.\n\nIn 1919 he moved to Los Angeles\u2014one of a number of New Orleans musicians to do so near that time\u2014and he recorded there in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey, clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson, and string bassist Ed Garland. Garland and Carey were longtime associates who would still be playing with Ory during his 1940s comeback. While in Los Angeles Ory and his band recorded two instrumentals, \"Ory's Creole Trombone\" and \"Society Blues\", as well as a number of songs. They were the first jazz recordings made on the west coast by an African-American jazz band from New Orleans. His band recorded with the recording company Nordskog and Ory paid them for the pressings and then sold them under his own label of \"Kid Ory's Sunshine Orchestra\" at a store in Los Angeles called Spikes Brothers Music Store. In 1925, Ory moved to Chicago, where he was very active, working and recording with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and many others. He mentored Benny Goodman, and later Charles Mingus.\n\nDuring the Great Depression Ory retired from music and did not play again until 1943. From 1944 to about 1961 he led one of the top New Orleans style bands of the period. In addition to Mutt Carey and Ed Garland, trumpeters Alvin Alcorn and Teddy Buckner; clarinetists Darnell Howard, Jimmie Noone, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, and George Probert; pianists Buster Wilson, Cedric Haywood, and Don Ewell; and drummer Minor Hall were among his sidemen during this period. All but Probert, Buckner, and Ewell were originally from New Orleans.\n\nThe Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz, making popular 1940s radio broadcasts\u2014among them a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program (beginning March 15, 1944).    In 1944\u201345 the group made a series of recordings on the Crescent Records label, founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory's band. \n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Ory and his group appeared at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles.\n\nOry retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii, with the assistance of Trummy Young. Ory died in Honolulu. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. \nDiscography\n\nWith Red Allen \n*Red Allen, Kid Ory & Jack Teagarden at Newport (Verve, 1957)\nQuestion:\nWith which instrument do you associate the jazz musician Kid Ory?\nAnswer:\nHarmonic glissando\nPassage:\nnew VW Scirocco \u2013 Volkswagen UK\nScirocco : Volkswagen UK\n\u2020At the end of the agreement there are three options: i) own the vehicle: pay the optional final payment; ii) return the vehicle: subject to fair wear and tear, charges may apply; or iii) replace: part exchange the vehicle.\n1\u00a32,000 towards your deposit when purchased on Solutions PCP (excluding Scirocco base trim).\n2 Acceptance fee is not required\n3Payable with optional final payment.\nFinance subject to status. 18s and over.

Pangrams have been used to display typefaces, test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and keyboarding.\n\nThe best known English pangram is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" It has been used since at least the late 19th century, was utilized by Western Union to test Telex / TWX data communication equipment for accuracy and reliability,  and is now used by a number of computer programs (most notably the font viewer built into Microsoft Windows) to display computer fonts. An example in another language is ', containing all letters used in German , including every umlaut (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) plus the \u00df.  It has been used since before 1800.\n\nShort pangrams in English are more difficult to come up with and tend to use uncommon words. A perfect pangram contains every letter of the alphabet only once and can be considered an anagram of the alphabet; it is the shortest possible pangram.  An example is the phrase \"Cwm fjord bank glyphs vext quiz\" (', a loan word from Welsh, means a steep-sided valley, particularly in Wales). However, such examples are not usually understood even by native English speakers, and so arguably are not really English pangrams. \n\nHere are some short pangrams using standard written English, not involving abbreviations or proper nouns:\n# \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.\" (32 letters)\n# \"Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.\" (31 letters)\n# \"The five boxing wizards jump quickly.\" (31 letters)\n# \"How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!\" (30 letters)\n# \"Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.\" (29 letters)\n\nLonger pangrams may afford more opportunity for humor, cleverness, or thoughtfulness.   \n\nIn a sense, the pangram is the opposite of the lipogram, in which the aim is to omit one or more letters.\n\nLogographic scripts \n\nLogographic scripts, that is, writing systems composed principally of logograms, cannot be used to produce pangrams in the literal sense, since they are radically different from alphabets or other phonetic writing systems. In such scripts, the total number of signs is large and imprecisely defined, so producing a text with every possible sign is impossible. However, various analogies to pangrams are feasible, including traditional pangrams in a romanization. In Japanese, although typical orthography uses kanji (logograms), pangrams are required to contain every kana (syllabic character) when written out in kana alone: the Iroha is a classic example.\n\nIn addition, it is possible to create pangrams that demonstrate certain aspects of logographic characters.\n\nIn Chinese, the Thousand Character Classic is a 1000-character poem in which each character is used exactly once; however, it does not include all Chinese characters. The single character  (permanence) incorporates every basic stroke used to write Chinese characters exactly once, as described in the Eight Principles of Yong.\n\nSelf-enumerating pangrams \n\nA self-enumerating pangram is a pangrammatic autogram, or a sentence that inventories its own letters, each of which occurs at least once. The first example was produced by Rudy Kousbroek, a Dutch journalist and essayist, who publicly challenged Lee Sallows, a British recreational mathematician resident in the Netherlands, to produce an English translation of his Dutch pangram. In the sequel, Sallows built an electronic \"pangram machine\", that performed a  systematic search among millions of candidate solutions. The machine was successful in identifying the following 'magic' translation:   \nThis pangram contains four As, one B, two Cs, one D, thirty Es, six Fs, five Gs, seven Hs, eleven Is, one J, one K, two Ls, two Ms, eighteen Ns, fifteen Os, two Ps, one Q, five Rs, twenty-seven Ss, eighteen Ts, two Us, seven Vs, eight Ws, two Xs, three Ys, & one Z.\n\nChris Patuzzo, a British computer scientist was able to reduce the problem of finding a self-enumerating pangram to the Boolean satisfiability problem. He did this by using a bespoke Hardware description language as a stepping stone and then applied the Tseitin transformation to the resulting chip. \n\nPangrams in literature\n\nThe pangram \"The quick brown fox...\" and searches for a shorter pangram are the cornerstone of the plot of the novel Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn.  The search successfully comes to an end when the phrase \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs\" is discovered.\nQuestion:\nComplete the following pangram: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy what?\"\nAnswer:\ndog\nPassage:\nSWOT Analysis - What it is and how to use it\nSWOT Analysis - What it is and how to use it\nHome > Goal Setting > SWOT Analysis\nSWOT Analysis for Goal Setting\nSWOT, which stands for Strengths,     Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats, is a way to     analyze and evaluate your current situation and environment. While     it's typically used for strategic planning in business settings, it can also     be used in goal setting to help you identify goals that will give     you the most benefit.

Just use the ones that make sense to     help you identify your strengths.\nA SWOT analysis is essential for any goal in a              business. If you ever plan to run your own business, consider a              Business Administration degree from Anna Maria College online to learn how to do properly prepare a SWOT analysis.\nThe next step is to identify your weaknesses,     which represent your internal liabilities. In many cases, the lack of a     strength or resource can be considered a weakness. Here are some     ideas to help you identify your weaknesses:\nWhat are your main liabilities in this area?\nList all the relevant skills, abilities and      talents that you would find helpful in this result area. Which      ones are you the least good or proficient at?\nList the specialized knowledge or expertise that      you would find helpful in this result area. Any knowledge or      expertise that you lack could be considered a weakness.\nAre there any resources (money, time, help) that      you currently don't have access to?\nWhat is not working in this area right now? What      related weaknesses does that reveal?\nYour strengths and weaknesses give you     an idea of your internal capabilities, resources and liabilities.     The next step in SWOT analysis is to identify your external opportunities for profit, growth and improvement. Here are some     ideas to help you identify them:\nList the opportunities that you have been      considering.\nWhat things could you improve in this result      area?\nThink of one thing you could do that would      significantly improve your situation in this area.\nWhat important goals could you pursue?\nHow can you take advantage of your strengths?\nCan you take advantage of any changes in your      environment or circumstances?\nWhat opportunities would become available to you      if you eliminate some of your weaknesses?\nNow identify your threats, which represent     external events, environmental factors, or changes that could affect     you negatively. Here are some ideas to help you identify some     threats:\nMake a list of serious risks you are facing in      this area if you continue along your current path.\nWhat obstacles or roadblocks are impeding your      progress?\nWhat environmental factors are affecting you      negatively?\nThink about how current changes to your      environment or circumstances could affect you negatively.\nUsing SWOT Analysis to Identify Targets and     Strategies\nThe whole point of doing a SWOT analysis is to help     you identify the most beneficial targets and strategies to pursue     right now based on your current situation, and to identify     strategies that will help you prepare for the future.\nYou do this by analyzing the four quadrants of the     SWOT matrix.\nSWOT Quadrant I - Strengths/Opportunities (SO)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     take advantage of your core strengths to aggressively pursue the     best opportunities at your disposal. This is particularly important     if the opportunities are short-lived. An example would be to utilize     a temporary competitive advantage to gain market share in your     business.\nSWOT Quadrant II - Strengths/Threats (ST)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     utilize your strengths to actively eliminate or reduce threats you     are facing.\nSWOT Quadrant III-Weaknesses/Opportunities (WO)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you open up opportunities down the road by working to     reduce some of your weaknesses (or making your strengths even     stronger). You can use this quadrant to help you prepare a long-term     improvement plan.\nSWOT Quadrant IV - Weaknesses/Threats (WT)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you mitigate and avoid threats that could result from your     weaknesses. You could do this by eliminating the weaknesses and     turning them into strengths, or by developing defensive strategies     to reduce the likelihood or severity of the threat.\nSummary\nThe four SWOT quadrants provide different     perspectives to help you identify targets and strategies:\nSO Quadrant - Opportunities to Pursue\nST Quadrant - Threats to Eliminate\nWO Quadrant - Things to Improve\nWT Quadrant - Risk Mitigation & Avoidance\nOver the long term, you should include goals from     each of the four quadrants for balance. In the short term, you may     want to focus on one or two quadrants to take advantage of any     circumstances you are currently facing.\nSuccesses/Failures Analysis\nWhile SWOT analysis is a good way to examine you     current situation looking forward, it doesn't always reveal past     trends that you can learn from. A successes/failures analysis     complements the SWOT matrix and can give you more insight into your     strengths and weaknesses.\nYou start by listing all your successes and     achievements in this result area, followed by listing all your     failures or missteps. Once you've listed them, you can identify     additional strengths and weaknesses based on the trends that they     show you.\nQuestion:\nIn SWOT analysis used in business, for what does the 'S' stand?\nAnswer:\nSTRENGTHS, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats\nPassage:\nEndothermic process\nThe term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings; usually, but not always, in the form of heat. The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo-, derived from the word \"endon\" (\u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd) meaning \"within\" and the root \"therm\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc-) meaning \"hot.\" The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed. The opposite of an  endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases, \"gives out\" energy in the form of (usually, but not always) heat. Thus in each term (endothermic & exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs, though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes, without necessarily being in the form of heat.\n\nThe concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to, for example, chemical reactions, where thermal energy (heat) is converted to chemical bond energy.\n\nEndothermic (and exothermic) analysis only accounts for the enthalpy change (\u2206H) of a reaction. The full energy analysis of a reaction is the Gibbs free energy (\u2206G), which includes an entropy (\u2206S) and temperature term in addition to the enthalpy. A reaction will be a spontaneous process at a certain temperature if the products have a lower Gibbs free energy (an exergonic reaction) even if the enthalpy of the products is higher. Entropy and enthalpy are different terms, so the change in entropic energy can overcome an opposite change in enthalpic energy and make an endothermic reaction favorable.\n\nExamples\n\n* Photosynthesis\n* Melting ice\n* Evaporating liquid water\n* Sublimation of carbon dioxide (dry ice)\n* Cracking of alkanes\n* Thermal decomposition reactions\n* Electrolytic decomposition of sodium chloride into sodium hydroxide and hydrogen chloride \n* Dissolving ammonium chloride in water\n* Nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than nickel in stellar cores\n* High-energy neutrons can produce tritium from lithium-7 in an endothermic reaction, consuming 2.466 MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield.\n\n* Nuclear fusion of elements heavier than iron in supernovae\nQuestion:\nWhat is absorbed in an endothermic reaction?\nAnswer:\nHeat as energy\nPassage:\nBelgrade Theatre\nThe Belgrade Theatre is a live performance venue seating 858 and situated in Coventry, England. It was the first civic theatre to be built after the Second World War in Britain and as such was more than a place of entertainment. It joined the new Coventry Cathedral as a symbol of optimism and culture in one of the largest re-development projects then undertaken, to rebuild the city of Coventry, which had been almost totally destroyed by bombing. The building is now a grade II listed building. In 1963 the Belgrade was registered as a charity by the Charity Commission (number 219163). \nThe Belgrade acquired its name in recognition and thanks for a gift of timber from the Yugoslavian (today Serbian) capital city of Belgrade (Coventry's official sister city), that was used extensively in the construction of the auditorium. Since opening in 1958, the theatre has established itself as a centre for the new and innovative productions.\n\nHaving pioneered the Theatre-in-Education movement in the 1960s the theatre continues to work with disadvantaged young people and uses drama as a tool to develop personal and social skills. Their most successful programme \"Acting Out\" has been commissioned by Coventry's LEA for the last 10 years and has been replicated across the UK. One graduate of the course credits \"Acting Out\" with saving her life. \n\nThe theatre reopened in September 2007 after undergoing a \u00a312\u00a0million refurbishment with a 7-storey extension to provide a second auditorium.\n\nPrince Edward officially opened the refurbishment of the Belgrade's B2 studio on 5 February 2008, this also marked the 50th anniversary of the Belgrade's opening performed by Princess Alexandra.\nQuestion:\nIn which English city did the Belgrade Theatre open in 1958?\nAnswer:\nCofantre\nPassage:\nSomething Rotten\nSomething Rotten is the fourth\nbook in the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde.  It continues the story some two years after the point where The Well of Lost Plots leaves off.\n\nPlot introduction\n\nThe book sees Thursday return from the world of fiction to the alternative Swindon that Fforde introduced in The Eyre Affair; she is accompanied by Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, whose excursion from the world of fiction with Thursday forms the main sub-plot.\n\nThe title is taken from Hamlet I.iv:  \"Something is rotten in the State of Denmark\".\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947.  Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old.\n\nThursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him.  Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenberg cake, has some curious house guests:  Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos.  Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them.\n\nDespite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues.  She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the ageing English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike.\n\nThursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him.  On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\").  Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday.\n\nGoliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO\u2014at their headquarters in the Isle of Man\u2014and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness.  Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband.  Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilise. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly.\n\nOn top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy).\n\nShe succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.\nQuestion:\nWhich sport is played by the Reading Thwackers and the Swindon Mallets in the Jasper Fforde book \u2018Something Rotten\u2019?\nAnswer:\nCroquet mallet\nPassage:\nPresident George H. W. Bush - The White House | whitehouse.gov\nGeorge H. W. Bush | whitehouse.gov\nAir Force One\nGeorge H. W. Bush\nGeorge H. W. Bush, as the 41st President (1989-1993), brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States \"a kinder and gentler nation\" in the face of a dramatically changing world.\nGeorge Bush brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States \"a kinder and gentler nation.\" In his Inaugural Address he pledged in \"a moment rich with promise\" to use American strength as \"a force for good.\"\nComing from a family with a tradition of public service, George Herbert Walker Bush felt the responsibility to make his contribution both in time of war and in peace. Born in Milton, Massachusetts, on June 12, 1924, he became a student leader at Phillips Academy in Andover. On his 18th birthday he enlisted in the armed forces. The youngest pilot in the Navy when he received his wings, he flew 58 combat missions during World War II. On one mission over the Pacific as a torpedo bomber pilot he was shot down by Japanese antiaircraft fire and was rescued from the water by a U. S. submarine. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action.\nBush next turned his energies toward completing his education and raising a family. In January 1945 he married Barbara Pierce. They had six children-- George, Robin (who died as a child), John (known as Jeb), Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy.\nAt Yale University he excelled both in sports and in his studies; he was captain of the baseball team and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation Bush embarked on a career in the oil industry of West Texas.\nLike his father, Prescott Bush, who was elected a Senator from Connecticut in 1952, George became interested in public service and politics. He served two terms as a Representative to Congress from Texas. Twice he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate. Then he was appointed to a series of high-level positions: Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U. S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\nIn 1980 Bush campaigned for the Republican nomination for President. He lost, but was chosen as a running mate by Ronald Reagan. As Vice President, Bush had responsibility in several domestic areas, including Federal deregulation and anti-drug programs, and visited scores of foreign countries. In 1988 Bush won the Republican nomination for President and, with Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate, he defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the general election.\nBush faced a dramatically changing world, as the Cold War ended after 40 bitter years, the Communist empire broke up, and the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union ceased to exist; and reformist President Mikhail Gorbachev, whom Bush had supported, resigned. While Bush hailed the march of democracy, he insisted on restraint in U. S. policy toward the group of new nations.\nIn other areas of foreign policy, President Bush sent American troops into Panama to overthrow the corrupt regime of General Manuel Noriega, who was threatening the security of the canal and the Americans living there. Noriega was brought to the United States for trial as a drug trafficker.\nBush's greatest test came when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, then threatened to move into Saudi Arabia. Vowing to free Kuwait, Bush rallied the United Nations, the U. S. people, and Congress and sent 425,000 American troops. They were joined by 118,000 troops from allied nations. After weeks of air and missile bombardment, the 100-hour land battle dubbed Desert Storm routed Iraq's million-man army.\nDespite unprecedented popularity from this military and diplomatic triumph, Bush was unable to withstand discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending. In 1992 he lost his bid for reelection to Democrat William Clinton.\nThe Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from \u201cThe Presidents of the United States of America,\u201d by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey.

Six streets converge at the junction: Park Lane (from the north), Piccadilly (northeast), Constitution Hill (southeast), Grosvenor Place (south), Grosvenor Crescent (southwest) and Knightsbridge (west).\n\nHyde Park Corner tube station, a London Underground station served by the Piccadilly line, is located at the junction as well as a number of notable monuments.\n\nImmediately to the north of the junction is Apsley House, the home of the first Duke of Wellington, and several monuments to the Duke were erected in the vicinity in his lifetime and subsequently.\n\nEvolution and development \n\n \nIn the centre of the Hyde Park Corner traffic island stands the Wellington Arch (or Constitution Arch), designed by Decimus Burton and planned as a northern gate to the grounds of Buckingham Palace.  In execution, it was laid out as a gate into the Green Park and was originally sited directly opposite Burton's Ionic Screen (also known as the Hyde Park Corner Screen) which still provides a gate into Hyde Park.  Originally, the arch was topped with an equestrian statue of the Duke (by Matthew Cotes Wyatt).  \n\nBecause of traffic congestion, the arch was moved south and realigned to the axis of Constitution Hill in 1883. The boundary of Buckingham Palace's garden were moved south, and a new road named Duke of Wellington Place was created separating the space containing the arch from the rest of the Green Park. At this time the large equestrian statue was removed to Sandhurst.  It was subsequently replaced with the current work, entitled The Angel of Peace descending on the Quadriga of Victory, dated 1912, by the sculptor Adrian Jones. \n\nFollowing the passage of the Park Lane Improvement Act 1958, Park Lane was widened in the early 1960s.  For most of its length this was achieved by converting the former East Carriage Drive of Hyde Park into the northbund lanes of a dual carriageway, but at Hyde Park Corner, all lanes of traffic came together on a line immediately to the east of Apsley House that required demolition of houses on Piccadilly. This left Apsley House on an island site.  The InterContinental London hotel was subsequently built on the cleared site between the new route of Park Lane and Hamilton Place.\n\nAt part of the same scheme, a tunnel was constructed beneath the junction to allow traffic to flow freely between Knightsbridge and Piccadilly.   As a result, the area around the arch became a large traffic island, mostly laid to grass, and accessible only by pedestrian underpassess, and formally ceased to be part of the Green Park.\n\nSubsequent changes to the road layout in the 1990s reinstated a route between Hyde Park and the Green Park for pedestrians, cyclists and horseriders using surface level crossings.\n\nThe traffic island includes a smaller equestrian statue of Wellington by Edgar Boehm unveiled in 1888, the Machine Gun Corps Memorial, the Royal Artillery Memorial, the Australian War Memorial and the New Zealand War Memorial. \n\nOther monuments in the vicinity of Hyde Park Corner include  Adrian Jones's Monument to the Cavalry of the Empire (off the west side of Park Lane),  Alexander Munro's Boy and Dolphin statue (in a rose garden parallel to Rotten Row, going west from Hyde Park Corner), the Queen Elizabeth Gate (behind Apsley House), the Wellington Monument (off the west side of Park Lane), and a statue of Lord Byron (on a traffic island opposite the Wellington Monument).\n\nThe term is often erroneously used for Speakers' Corner, which is located at the north-eastern corner of Hyde Park.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n*The 1935 film Hyde Park Corner takes its name from the area, where it is set.\n*\"Hyde Park Corner\" was used as a codeword to announce to the government the death of King George VI in 1952. \n\nGallery of memorials\n\nFile:Australian War Memorial, Hyde Park Corner - geograph.org.uk - 1463114.jpg|Australian War Memorial\nFile:Byron Statue - geograph.org.uk - 1574255.jpg|Statue of Lord Byron\nFile:Statue of the Duke of Wellington - geograph.org.uk - 397832.jpg|Equestrian Statue of the Duke of Wellington\nFile:DavidLondon.JPG|Machine Gun Corps Memorial\nFile:NZ war memorial, London.JPG|New Zealand War Memorial\nFile:Royal Artillery Memorial, outside Aspley House, London.JPG|Royal Artillery Memorial\nQuestion:\nNamed after the 16/17th century fancy collar that made a fortune for Robert Baker, which London street starts at Hyde Park Corner and ends at a famous statue ?

Anatomy of seed plants. John Wiley and Sons, New York. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of Gaultheria procumbens or Syzygium jambos. Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, with much of the fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium.  Other example could be the anthocarps specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls).\n\nFruit with fleshy seeds, such as pomegranate or mamoncillo, are not considered to be accessory fruit.\n\nThe terms false fruit, spurious fruit, and pseudocarp are older terms for accessory fruit that have been criticized as \"inapt\", and are not used by botanists today.\nQuestion:\nPseudocarp relates to which type of crop?\nAnswer:\nFruiting\n", "answers": ["The Black Eyed Peas", "Yesterday (The Black Eyed Peas song)", "Black Eyed Peas", "Instant def", "The Black-Eyed Peas", "The black eyed peas", "Black Eyed Peas (band)", "TBEP", "Roots to Fruits", "Black eyed peas (band)", "Black-Eyed Peas", "Black Eyed Peas, The", "Black Eyed peas (group)", "Black eyed pees", "BLACK EYED PEAS", "Black-eyed Peas", "Yesterday (The Black Eyed Peas)", "Black Eye Peas"], "pred": "Check Out the Full PCM 2009. 2019. 2020. 2020. 2020. 2020. 2020", "length": 11494, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bf1556b2b68228cd71538d898121398f8e47fbaa45c6f717"}
{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nFatted calf\nFatted calf is a metaphor or symbol of festive celebration and rejoicing for someone's long-awaited return. It derives from the parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament.  In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal.  Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions.  Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father \"kills the fatted calf\" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.\n\nIn modern usage, \"killing the fatted calf\" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song \"Bennie and the Jets\".\nQuestion:\n\"In the Bible, whose return heralded the killing of \"\"the fatted calf\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nLoving Father\nPassage:\nKingdom of the Algarve\nThe Kingdom of the Algarve (Portuguese: Reino do Algarve, from the Arabic Gharb al-Andalus\u063a\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633), later the Kingdom of the Algarves (Portuguese: Reino dos Algarves), was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nIt was the second dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal, though in fact the Algarvian kingdom had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy. \nIn actuality, it was just an honorific title for the Algarve based on its history and was very similar to the rest of the Portuguese provinces. \n\nThe title King of Silves was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of Silves in 1189. As this conquest did not take all of the Algarve, D. Sancho never used the title King of Portugal and the Algarve, but instead it was adopted by his grandson Afonso III of Portugal as a part of the titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown.\n\nHistory\n\nReconquista\n\nDuring the Reconquista, Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to take lands from the Muslims that they claimed as theirs. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King Afonso III of Portugal.\n\nFirst conquest\n\nIn 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered Silves, one of the most prosperous cities in Al-Andalus, aligned at the time with the Almohad Caliphate. Portuguese control over Silves would be short, with the Almohads conquering the city again in 1191 in a massive counter-attack led by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur the Almohad Caliph in person.\n\nThe conquest of Algarve\n\nWith the decline of the Almohads, the southern taifa city-states united under a single Emir, M\u00fbs\u00e2 Ibn Muhammad Ibn Nassir Ibn Mahf\u00fbz, former governor of Niebla, and known among the Christians as Aben Mafom.\n\nAben Mafom, King of Niebla and Emir of Algarve, trying to counter the achievements made by the Portuguese in their territories, declared vassalage to Alfonso X of Castile (who thus titled himself the King of the Algarve). Through his vassals, Alfonso X hoped to claim dominion over the Algarve not yet conquered by the Portuguese. \n\nThe Emir's vow of vassalage to Castille however did not stop the knights of the Order of Santiago, under the command of the Grand-Master Paio Peres Correia, from conquering most of the region city by city, between 1242 and 1249, including Silves. In March 1249, King Afonso III of Portugal captured Faro, the last Muslim stronghold in Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista.\n\nThe entitlement of Afonso III of Portugal as King of Portugal and the Algarve would serve as a reaction to Alfonso X of Castile's claim to the Algarve and was designed to demonstrate the rights of the Portuguese monarch on the region concerned.\n\nThe issue between the sovereigns of Castille and Portugal was eventually settled by the Treaty of Badajoz (1267), where King Alfonso X gave up his claims of the Algarve, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne of the Algarve, which dictated the terms of its incorporation into the Portuguese crown. The treaty, though, allowed the use of the title of King of the Algarve for King Alfonso X and his descendants, since King Alfonso X had acquired the territories of Al-Gharb Al-Andalus on the other side of the Guadiana river. The kings of Castile, and then Spain, would add the title to their repertoire of titles until the ascent of Queen Isabel II of Spain to the throne.\n\nAge of Discoveries\n\nDuring the Age of Discoveries, the Algarve served as the location for the embarkment for many voyages, mainly those funded by the Infante D. Henrique. Prince Henry also set up his famous school of navigation at Sagres Point, though the idea of a real school building and campus is highly disputed. Most of the voyages set sail from Lagos.\n\nThe Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\n\nThe name of the Algarvian Kingdom suffered some minor changes due to the Portuguese North African conquests, which were considered an extension of the kingdom of Algarve. John I of Portugal added to the title of \"King of Portugal and the Algarve\", the title \"Lord of Ceuta\", and his grandson Afonso V of Portugal, in turn, styled himself \"Lord of Ceuta and Alcacer-Ceguer in Africa\" (after 1458). The 1471 conquest of Asilah, Tangiers and Larache, together with North African previous holdings, led to the creation of the title \"the Algarves from either side of the sea in Africa\", leaving the European Algarve to become \"the Algarve behind the sea.\"\n\nThus, it was not until 1471 that \"the Kingdom of the Algarve\" led to \"the Kingdom of the Algarves\", due to the increase of Portuguese possessions in Northern Africa, which were made as possessions of the Kingdom of the Algarve. The Portuguese monarchs therefore adopted the title that they would use until the fall of the monarchy in 1910: \"Kings of Portugal and the Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\". The title would continue to be used even after the abandonment of the last North African holding in Mazagan (Portuguese: Mazag\u00e3o; lost by Portugal in 1769).\n\n19th century conflicts\n\nDuring the 19th century, a serious clash between liberals and Miguelites, caused an exodus of people from the Algarvian inlands to the coastal cities. Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Sousa Reis, the Remexido, and fought in the inlands and attacked the coastal cities, bringing the urban population into turmoil. The turmoil of the Algarve intensified in the years between 1834 and 1838, when the Algarve saw battles on a level it had never seen before. On November 26, 1836, Miguel I of Portugal named Remexido Governor of the Kingdom of the Algarve and Acting Commander in Chief of all the Royalist Troops, Regular and Irregular Armies, and the Operations in the South. Remexido, however, was shot in Faro on August 2, 1838.\nQuestion:\n\"In which country is the area called \"\"the Algarve\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nPortoga\u0142o\nPassage:\nNanosecond\nA nanosecond (ns) is a SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (10 or 1/1,000,000,000 s). One nanosecond is to one second as one second is to 31.71\u00a0years.\n\nThe word nanosecond is formed by the prefix nano and the unit second. Its symbol is ns.\n\nA nanosecond is equal to 1000\u00a0picoseconds or \u00a0microsecond.  Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10 and 10 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds.\n\nTimes of this magnitude are commonly encountered in telecommunications, pulsed lasers and some areas of electronics.\n\nLight travels exactly 29.9792458 \u00a0centimeters in 1\u00a0nanosecond. This is equivalent to 11.8\u00a0inches, leading some to refer to a nanosecond as a light-foot.  A light-foot is actually ~1.0167033621639674471063578257196\u00a0nanoseconds. \nThe earliest use of the term is by George Gamow.  Another early reference commonly given  is to Admiral Grace Hopper, who used to give out pieces of wire about a foot long to illustrate the eventual problem of building very high speed computers.   If it takes light a nanosecond to go a foot (in a vacuum, slower in copper), then a computer built with parts connected by half this distance, 15 cm of wire, would take at least a nanosecond to send data to a part and get a response.  The solution, developed in Hopper's lifetime, was first the integrated circuit and later the multi-core processor.\n\n\"Once she presented a piece of wire about a foot long, and explained that it represented a nanosecond, since it was the maximum distance electricity could travel in wire in one-billionth of a second. She often contrasted this nanosecond with a microsecond - a coil of wire nearly a thousand feet long - as she encouraged programmers not to waste even a microsecond.\"\n\nCommon measurements \n\n* 0.5 nanoseconds (0.5\u00a0ns) \u2013 the average life of a molecule of positronium hydride\n* 1.0 nanosecond \u2013 cycle time for radio frequency 1\u00a0GHz (1 hertz), an inverse unit.

It is still used for special occasions.\n\nTo \"lay a h\u0101ngi\" or \"put down a h\u0101ngi\" involves digging a pit in the ground, heating stones in the pit with a large fire, placing baskets of food on top of the stones, and covering everything with earth for several hours before uncovering (or lifting) the h\u0101ngi. \n\nThere are many variations and details that can be altered. H\u0101ngi \"experts\" have developed and improved methods that often, like the stones themselves, have been handed down for generations. Another name sometimes used is umu, for instance the umu t\u012b, used in the South Island to cook Cabbage trees (Cordyline australis). \n\nThe evolution of h\u0101ngi methods \n\nEvidence from early Polynesian settler sites in New Zealand such as Wairau Bar and in coastal Otago Peninsula from about 1280 shows a significant number of large cooking pits or umu which were designed to cook Ti-pore or various species of Cordyline. This was a common east Polynesian practice in the Cook Islands and Society Islands. The remains of large umu have also been found in the Kermadec Islands. The .900 long, carrot shaped tap root was cooked in a large stone lined pit for between 1 and 2 days. Various sources say it was baked while some say steamed. The result was a fibrous mass of sweet pulp that had a bitter after taste. Investigation in Otago shows that most pits were used only once or perhaps twice before making a new pit. Some sources say the longer the cooking, the sweeter the pulp. This may have been due to the evaporation of the water content. The distinguishing feature of a Ti- pore was its large size compared to a normal cooking earth oven.  \nPrior to colonisation and the introduction of metals and wire, food was laid out on clean sticks, bark, large leaves and other vegetation to minimize direct contact with the hot rocks and reduce burning. Carved bowls and flat rocks were also used for this purpose.\nLeaves, sticks and vegetation were used to cover the food and to prevent crushing from the weight of the earth on top.\n\nMany different h\u0101ngi methods are now used. Wire baskets became widely used in the early 19th century with sacking and cloth replacing leaves and bark as the covering of choice. Red hot iron or steel may be used in addition to or instead of stones.\n\nIn the early 21st century, gas heated stainless steel \"h\u0101ngi machines\" are sometimes used to replicate the style of cooking without the need for a wood fire, rocks and a pit.\nQuestion:\nHangi is a traditional New Zealand Maori method of cooking using a?\nAnswer:\nPit\nPassage:\nPholadidae\nPholadidae, known as piddocks or angelwings, are a family of bivalve mollusc similar to a clam.\n\nBackground\n\nPidocks are unique in that each side of their shells is divided into 2 or 3 separate sections. Furthermore, one of the piddock's shells has a set of ridges or \"teeth\", which they use to grind away at clay or soft rock and create tubular burrows. The shape of these burrows is due to the rotating motion of the piddock as it grinds the rock to make its home. The piddock stays in the burrow it digs for the entirety of its eight-year lifespan, with only its siphon exposed to take in water that it filters for food. When the piddock dies and leaves an empty tubular burrow, other marine life such as sea anemone, crabs and other molluscs may use the burrow.\n\nSome species of Pholadidae may reach up to 18\u00a0cm (7\u2033). Their coloration is typically white, though through consumption of red tide algae some may develop a pink coloration.\n\n* The angelwing species Cyrtopleura costata has approximately 26 radiating ribs. Growth lines run horizontally over the surface of the shell. Angelwings have a spoon-shaped brace under the beak of the shell, called the apophysis, where the mollusc's foot muscles are attached. Cyrtopleura costata possesses long siphons which protrude from its burrow and circulate water as the source for its food supply. It cannot retract its siphons into the protection of its shell, so the two valves can never shut completely. The muscles fusing the shell's valves together are weak, making it rare to find angelwings with both halves still intact. Some shell hunters dig for the living clam, and if dug up, the fragile shell must be placed immediately into a container of water or it will close and shatter. The angelwing's shell is popular with collectors, as well as a delicious food staple. The angelwing lives offshore and in estuaries, sometimes as much as a metre (three feet) deep in the mud or clay.\n* The Atlantic mud-piddock, Barnea truncata, often referred to as the fallen angelwing, is classed among the angelwing varieties, growing up to 5.7\u00a0cm (2\u00bc\u2033) and is similar to other angelwings but with weaker sculpture. One end is squared off and the other end pointed. Loose accessory plates are located above the hinge on live specimens. It possesses a white exterior and interior. It burrows into mud, clay or softwood. Occasionally it is washed onto sounds and ocean beaches, and has a habitat range from Maine to Brazil. This fragile shell is rarely dug from mud without breaking. It burrows deeply and has long, united siphons.\n* The false angelwing Petricola pholadiformis, is also classed among varieties of angelwing, growing up to 7\u00a0cm (2\u00be\u2033). It has a thin, elongate shell resembling a small angelwing but lacks the rolled-out hinge area. Its beak is at one end of the shell with strong radial ribbing on the beak end. Teeth are located on hinge and a deep pallial sinus and partially united siphons. It has a white exterior and interior. It typically burrows into hard surfaces such as clay or peat in intertidal zones. It is commonly found on sounds and ocean beaches with a range from Canada to Uruguay.\n* The common piddock (Pholas dactylus) is known for its bioluminescence[http://www.marlin.ac.uk/species/Pholasdactylus.htm Basic information for Pholas dactylus (Common piddock)]  and was investigated by Rapha\u00ebl Dubois in his 1887 discovery of luciferin.\n\nGenera and selected species\n\n* Genus Barnea Risso, 1826\n** Barnea candida Linnaeus, 1758\n** Barnea fragilis\n** Barnea manilensis (Philippi, 1847)\n** Barnea parva Pennant, 1777\n** Barnea similis (Gray, 1835)\n** Barnea subtruncata (G.

It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. The site is in\nthe parish of Turners Puddle in Purbeck District.\n\nHistory\n\nThe small building has colourwashed brick walls and a tiled roof. It was probably built as forester's cottage in the early 19th century.  The lintel over the door now bears a Greek inscription \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 (\"Why Worry\"). It is now a Grade II* listed building as \"Clouds Hill (Lawrence of Arabia's Cottage)\"; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015. \n\nLawrence first rented the cottage in 1923 while stationed at nearby Bovington Camp with the Tank Corps.  He made it habitable with the help of a friend, then bought it in 1925 and used it as a holiday home. He described it as an earthly paradise and wrote \"Nothing in Clouds Hill is to be a care upon the world. While I have it there shall be nothing exquisite or unique in it. Nothing to anchor me.\" The cottage had no electric lights and three living rooms, described as an eating room, book room and music room. For heat insulation Lawrence had the eating room lined with asbestos that was covered in aluminium foil, and he kept his food under glass domes. In the book room he installed a large leather divan, and in the music room above it he had his gramophone \"with a huge amplifier horn\", a leather sofa and chair.\n\nIn 1935 Lawrence left the Royal Air Force and lived at Clouds Hill. A few weeks later, at the age of 46, he suffered severe head injuries in a motorcycle accident close to the cottage, and died in the Bovington Camp hospital on 19 May 1935. The following year, his heir, his brother A. W. Lawrence gave Clouds Hill to the National Trust. It is now a museum, dedicated to Lawrence. It is open to visitors from the end of March to the beginning of October, Thursday \u2013 Sunday.\n\nThe cottage remains largely as Lawrence left it at his death.  It features an exhibition detailing Lawrence's life, and most of his original furniture and possessions. The cottage reflects his complex personality and links to the Middle East.\n\nThe circular Lawrence of Arabia Trail starts and finishes at Bovington's The Tank Museum, taking in Clouds Hill and the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church in Moreton, Lawrence's final resting place. \n\nSleeping bags\n\nLawrence reserved a sleeping bag for guests and visitors who stayed overnight. In 1965 it was stolen. The bag's disappearance coincided with the release of Lawrence of Arabia, the film which popularised his story and it was thought the theft could have been inspired by the publicity and excitement generated by the film.\n\nIn 2001, the sleeping bag was returned. The Independent reported: \n\n\"The sleeping bag that served as a guest bed to some of the 20th century's most distinguished authors at TE Lawrence's weekend retreat has been returned 36 years after it was stolen. National Trust custodians of Clouds Hill, the author's cottage in Dorset, were amazed when a weather-beaten package from Belgium arrived containing the sleeping bag, along with a sheepish note that read: 'This is yours'. The bag, embroidered with the word 'tuum' ['yours'], was provided for guests at the cottage, while Lawrence slept on the floor in the other sleeping bag, marked 'meum' ['mine']. According to Jeremy Wilson, Lawrence's biographer, tuum's occupants included George Bernard Shaw, E. M.

Some versions are sculpted or slashed into a pattern resembling an ear of wheat.\n\nHistory and etymology\n\nIn ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flatbread baked in the ashes of the hearth (focus in Latin).  This became a diverse range of breads that include focaccia in Italian cuisine, hogaza in Spain, fogassa in Catalonia, fug\u00e0ssa in Ligurian, poga\u010da in the Balkans, pog\u00e1csa in Hungary, fougasse in Provence (originally spelled fogatza), fouace or fou\u00e9e in other French regions and on the Channel Islands.  The Provence version is more likely to have additions in the form of olives, cheese, or anchovies, which may be regarded as a primitive form of pizza without the tomato.\n\nThere is also in Portugal the foga\u00e7a, a sweet bread. In Brazil, p\u00e3o sovado is a typical big fougasse, while a recipe, typical of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Esp\u00edrito Santo and surrounding regions, that is halfway between fougasse and bolillo (in these regions known as p\u00e3o franc\u00eas or p\u00e3o-de-sal), somewhat resembling a savory small brioche, is called p\u00e3o su\u00ed\u00e7o. They are perhaps the sweetest of savory artisanal bread recipes commonly made in Brazil.\n\nFougasse was traditionally used to assess the temperature of a wood fired oven. The time it would take to bake gives an idea of the oven temperature and whether the rest of the bread can be loaded.\n\nFougasse is also a type of pastry from Monaco that is topped with almonds and nuts.\n\nUse in dishes\n\nIt is used to make the French version of calzone, which can have cheese and small squarish strips of bacon inside the pocket made by folding over the bread. Other variations include dried fruit, Roquefort and nuts or olives and goat cheese. It is known by extension as a fougasse even though it is more a sandwich than just a type of bread.\nQuestion:\nFougasse, associated with Provence, is what type of food?\nAnswer:\nSomun\nPassage:\nWaterborne diseases\nWaterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. Infection commonly results during bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food, or the consumption of food thus infected. Various forms of waterborne diarrheal disease probably are the most prominent examples, and affect mainly children in developing countries; according to the World Health Organization, such diseases account for an estimated 4.1% of the total DALY global burden of disease, and cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. \n\nOverview\n\nThe term \"waterborne disease\" is reserved largely for infections that predominantly are transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water. Trivially, many infections may be transmitted by microbes or parasites that accidentally, possibly as a result of exceptional circumstances, have entered the water, but the fact that there might be an occasional freak infection need not mean that it is useful to categorise the resulting disease as \"waterborne\". Nor is it common practice to refer to diseases such as malaria as \"waterborne\" just because mosquitoes have aquatic phases in their life cycles, or because treating the water they inhabit happens to be an effective strategy in control of the mosquitoes that are the vectors.\n\nMicroorganisms causing diseases that characteristically are waterborne prominently include protozoa and bacteria, many of which are intestinal parasites, or invade the tissues or circulatory system through walls of the digestive tract. Various other waterborne diseases are caused by viruses. (In spite of philosophical difficulties associated with defining viruses as \"organisms\", it is practical and convenient to regard them as microorganisms in this connection.)\n\nYet other important classes of water-borne diseases are caused by metazoan parasites. Typical examples include certain Nematoda, that is to say \"roundworms\". As an example of water-borne Nematode infections, one important waterborne nematodal disease is Dracunculiasis. It is acquired by swallowing water in which certain copepoda occur that act as vectors for the Nematoda. Anyone swallowing a copepod that happens to be infected with Nematode larvae in the genus Dracunculus, becomes liable to infection. The larvae cause guinea worm disease. \n\nAnother class of waterborne metazoan pathogens are certain members of the Schistosomatidae, a family of blood flukes. They usually infect victims that make skin contact with the water. Blood flukes are pathogens that cause Schistosomiasis of various forms, more or less seriously affecting hundreds of millions of people world-wide. \n\nLong before modern studies had established the germ theory of disease, or any advanced understanding of the nature of water as a vehicle for transmitting disease, traditional beliefs had cautioned against the consumption of water, rather favouring processed beverages such as beer, wine and tea. For example, in the camel caravans that crossed Central Asia along the Silk Road, the explorer Owen Lattimore noted, \"The reason we drank so much tea was because of the bad water. Water alone, unboiled, is never drunk. There is a superstition that it causes blisters on the feet.\" \n\nSocioeconomic impact\n\nWaterborne diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, locally as well as internationally. People who are infected by a waterborne disease are usually confronted with related costs and not seldom with a huge financial burden. This is especially the case in less developed countries. The financial losses are mostly caused by e.g. costs for medical treatment and medication, costs for transport, special food, and by the loss of manpower. Many families must even sell their land to pay for treatment in a proper hospital. On average, a family spends about 10% of the monthly households income per person infected. \n\nInfections by type of pathogen \n\nProtozoan \n\nParasitic \n\nBacterial \n\n*\n\nViral \n\n*\n\nAlgal \n\n*\nQuestion:\nThe devastating water-borne disease Schistosomiasis, or Snail Fever, is more commonly called what?\nAnswer:\nGenital schistosomiasis\nPassage:\nRochebaron\nRochebaron is a soft blue cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk, in the town of Beauzac in the Auvergne region, in the Massif Central, France.\n\nThis cheese is one of several that are made by curdling milk and separating the curds from the whey. Pressed into moulds, Rochebaron is then pierced with wires impregnated with Penicillium glaucum to produce blue veins through the soft whitish body of the cheese.

A Christian martyr is regarded as one who is put to death for his Christian faith or convictions. Confessors are people who died natural deaths. Date of Death: Saint Alban died in 305. Cause of Death - he was Beheaded.\u00a0\nHow Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art\nIt is helpful to be able to recognise Saint Alban in paintings, stained glass windows, illuminated manuscripts, architecture and other forms of Christian art. The artistic representations reflect the life or death of saints, or an aspect of life with which the person is most closely associated. Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art with a sword and a fountain.\nFeast Day of Saint Alban\nThe Feast Day of Saint Alban is June 22nd. The origin of Feast Days: most saints have specially designated feast days and are associated with a specific day of the year and these are referred to as the saint's feast day. The feast days first arose from the very early Christian custom of the annual commemoration of martyrs on the dates of their deaths at the same time celebrating their birth into heaven.\n\u00a0\nHistory, Life, Biography, Facts and Information about Saint Alban\nFast, concise facts and information about Saint Alban\nWhat is Saint Alban the patron of?\nDate of Death: 305\nQuestion:\nWho was the first English Christian martyr - his feast day is June 22nd.?\nAnswer:\nAlban, Saint\nPassage:\nWomen's Cricket World Cup\nThe ICC Women's Cricket World Cup is the premier international championship of women's One Day International cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was originally administered by the International Women's Cricket Council until the two associations merged in 2005. The first tournament was held in England in 1973, two years before the first men's tournament.\n\nParticipation in the tournament has varied through the eight competitions: fifteen different teams have played, but only Australia, England and New Zealand have appeared in every tournament. India have appeared in all but two of the competitions. Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Young England have all appeared in just one tournament: in each case, the first competition, in 1973.\n\nThe most recent tournament, the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, was held in India for the third time in February. In the final Australia beat West Indies by 114 runs at the Brabourne Stadium.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst World Cup\n\nWomen's international cricket was first played in 1934, when a party from England toured Australia and New Zealand. The first Test match was played on 28\u201331 December 1934, and was won by England.  The first Test against New Zealand followed early the following year. These three nations remained the only Test playing teams in women's cricket until 1960, when South Africa played a number of matches against England. Limited overs cricket was first played by first-class teams in England in 1962.  Nine years later, the first international one day match was played in men's cricket, when England took on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. \n\nTalks began in 1971 about holding a World Cup for women's cricket, led by Jack Hayward.  South Africa, under pressure from the world for their apartheid laws, were not invited to take part in the competition.  Both of the other two Test playing nations, Australia and New Zealand were invited. Hayward had previously organised tours of the West Indies by England women, and it was from this region that the other two competing nations were drawn; Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago. To make up the numbers, England also fielded a \"Young England\" team, and an \"International XI\" was also included. Five South Africans were invited to play for the International XI as a means of compensation for the team not being invited, but these invitations were later withdrawn.\n\nThe inaugural tournament was held at a variety of venues across England in June and July 1973,  two years before the first men's Cricket World Cup was played.  The competition was played as a round-robin tournament, and the last scheduled match was England against Australia. Australia went into the game leading the table by a solitary point: they had won four matches and had one abandoned. England had also won four matches, but they had lost to New Zealand.  As a result, the match also served as a de facto final for the competition. England won the match, held at Edgbaston, Birmingham by 92 runs to win the tournament. \n\nResults\n\nBy year\n\nBy team\n\n;Legend\n* \u2013 Champions\n* \u2013 Runners-up\n* \u2013 Third place\n* \u2013 Losing semi-finalist (no third-place playoff)\n*QF \u2013 Losing quarter-finalist (no further playoffs)\n*1R \u2013 First round\n*\u00a0\u2014 Hosts\n\nRecords\nQuestion:\nWho won the Women's Cricket World Cup played at Sydney, Australia, in 2009?\nAnswer:\nEnglnad\nPassage:\nMen's Fastest Mile Times (World Records) - About.com Sports\nWorld Records for Men's Fastest Mile Times\nBy Mike Rosenbaum\nUpdated September 23, 2016.\nIt\u2019s never been an Olympic or World Championship event, yet the mile remains the only non-metric race distance in which the IAAF recognizes a world record. Long after the other non-metric distances have vanished from the world record books, those 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards \u2013 or about 1.61 kilometers \u2013 continue to capture the imaginations of runners and fans alike as a premier middle distance event.\nThe first IAAF-recognized world record in the mile was run by John Paul Jones of the U.S. No, the record doesn\u2019t go back to the American Revolution. This John Paul Jones performed his feat on May 31, 1913, in Allston, Mass., where he completed the mile in 4:14.4. France\u2019s Jules Ladoumegue later brought the mark under 4:10, running 4:09.2 on Oct. 4, 1931, in Paris. The mark crept down toward the 4-minute mark throughout the 1940s. In a 3-year period from July 1942 through July 1945 a pair of Swedes, Gunder Hagg, and Arne Andersson, exchanged the record six times.\ncontinue reading below our video\nUnderstanding Baseball\nHagg ended the give-and-take with a time of 4:01.4 on July 17, 1945. His mark stood for almost nine years, during which time the pundits debated on whether a 4-minute mile was humanly possible, as a runner after runner tried and failed to crack a key psychological \u2013 and, as some believed, physical \u2013 barrier.\nThe 4-Minute Mile:\nOn May 6, 1954, great Britain\u2019s Roger Bannister answered the questions by running the first sub-4:00 miles, finishing in 3:59.4 while assisted by a pair of pacemakers. Bannister, then a medical student, developed his own training methods \u2013 featuring relatively short, intense workouts \u2013 that carried him through on a windy day. Bannister ran lap times of 57.5, 60.7, 62.3 and 58.9 seconds. He was timed in 3:43.0 through 1500 meters.\nWhile Bannister is famous for shattering the 4-minute barrier, many forget that he held the title for less than seven weeks before Australia\u2019s John Landy finished in 3:58.0 on June 21, 1954. Bannister retired from racing before the end of the year, to devote himself to medicine, but not before racing against Landy in \u201cThe Mile of the Century\u201d in Vancouver that August. Landy shot in front by the end of the first lap, hoping to wear out the normally fast-finishing Bannister. But Bannister ran his own race, paced himself, then shot into the lead with less than 90 yards remaining to win in 3:58.8 to Landy\u2019s 3:59.6, the first time two runners topped four minutes in the same race.\nIn 1958 Australia\u2019s Herb Elliott ran 3:54.5 to break the record set the previous year by Derek Ibbotson by 2.7 seconds, the biggest drop in the world record time during the IAAF era.\nThe record returned to U.S. soil in 1966 when the precocious Jim Ryun posted a 3:51.3 time, which he lowered to 3:51.1 the following year. Ryun was the first high school runner to break four minutes, with a time of 3:59 in 1964. At age 18 he owned the U.S. mile record of 3:55.3. At 19 he owned the world record. He was the fourth and, as of 2012, the last American to reign as the mile\u2019s world record-holder.\nJohn Walker Cracks 3:50:\nNew Zealand\u2019s John Walker took the record below 3:50 in August 1975 with a time of 3:49.4, fulfilling his promise to the organizers of the meet held in Goteborg, Sweden. Walker convinced meet officials to change the scheduled 1500-meter race to the mile, telling them he\u2019d take a shot at the world record. He was paced through the first half mile, with lap times of 55.8 and 59.3, then sped up on the final two laps, running the third quarter in 57.9 and the fourth in 56.4 seconds. Walker eventually became the first man to run 100 sub-4:00 miles.\nGreat Britain then enjoyed a stretch of 14 years in which three different British runners owned the mark. Just as Hagg and Andersson played give-and-go with the record in the \u201840s, so too did Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett in 1979-81. In a 25-month stretch, beginning in July 1979 when Coe edged Walker\u2019s mark by four-tenths of a second, Coe owned the record three times and Ovett twice. Coe began the British siege in only the third-mile race of his life, in an Oslo meet in which Walker participated. Coe finally prevailed in his duel with Ovett, as Coe\u2019s time of 3:47.33 set in August of 1981 lived for almost four years before Steve Cram lowered it to 3:46.32 in 1985.\nEl Guerrouj Takes Charge:\nOnly one African runner \u2013 Filbert Bayi, who broke Ryun\u2019s record and held the mile mark for just three months \u2013 had owned the mile record before Algeria\u2019s Noureddine Morceli topped Cram\u2019s mark by running 3:44.39 on Sept. 5, 1993. The 1.93-second drop in the record was the largest margin since Ryun set his first record in 1966. Morocco\u2019s Hicham El Guerrouj then lowered the mark to 3:43.13 on July 7, 1999 \u2013 almost identical to Bannister\u2019s 1500-meter time in 1954 \u2013 yet came close to losing the race, held in Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium. Noah Ngeny ran with El Guerrouj all the way and edged Morceli\u2019s record as well, finishing in 3:43.40. With his mark still intact in 2015, El Guerrouj has held the IAAF mile record longer than anyone else, while Ngeny\u2019s time remained No. 2 on the all-time list. As of 2015, El Guerrouj had seven of the top 10 mile times in history; Alan Webb owns the fastest mile of the 21st century by someone other than El Guerrouj, posting a time of 3:46.91 in 2007.\nRead more about:\nQuestion:\nWho was the first man to break three and a half minutes for the 1500 metres\nAnswer:\nStephen Cram\nPassage:\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer ...\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\n* Premier League leads way as soccer clubs splash TV cash\n* Real Madrid and Barcelona defy Spain's economic downturn\n* Clubs seen complying with UEFA rules despite investment\nBy Keith Weir\nLONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European soccer clubs have reinvested cash from television deals to go on a record-breaking summer spending spree led by teams from the English Premier League and Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.\nClubs in the English top flight had spent 630 million pounds ($980.5 million) by the player transfer deadline on Monday night. Teams in the big European leagues must now wait until January before they can hire new players.\nThe spending by English clubs broke the 2008 record of 500 million pounds, according to figures compiled by business services group Deloitte, and underlined the Premier League's status as the world's richest national competition.\n\"As the financial rewards for participation and success in the Premier League increase, so it follows that clubs are investing on the pitch to ensure they continue to benefit from the remarkable Premier League growth story,\" Deloitte's Dan Jones said.\nChampions Manchester United and the other 19 Premier League teams are expected to share revenues of about 1.6 billion pounds this season thanks to enhanced television deals with BSkyB and BT in Britain, and broadcasters around the globe that began last month.\nIt was not all one-way traffic as the Premier League lost one of its biggest names when Real Madrid bought Welshman Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur for a world record 100 million euros ($132 million).\nNot to be outdone, Real's perennial rivals Barcelona spent $75 million to buy Brazil forward Neymar from Brazilian top division club Santos.\nPLAYING FAIR?\nSpending such sums might appear to defy logic given Spain's economic problems but Real and Barcelona enjoy the luxury of doing their own TV deals rather than pooling revenues as happens in England and other major leagues.\nThat has made the two clubs the world's richest in terms of revenues and allowed them to remain buyers when many of their Spanish rivals are forced to sell their best players.\nReal and Barcelona have TV deals with Spanish production and distribution company Mediapro. They both also have lucrative new main sponsorship deals this season - Barcelona with Qatar Airways and Real with the Emirates airline names on their kit.\nOverall spending levels may also raise eyebrows when loss-making clubs are supposed to be complying with new Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA, European soccer's governing body, to put soccer on a more stable footing.\n\"A lot of English clubs have gone on a spending spree but they haven't breached the Financial Fair Play rules as they are only spending what they have earned,\" said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports business at England's Coventry University.\nClubs also have the advantage of spreading the cost of a player's transfer over the duration of his contract in their accounts, lessening the impact on the bottom line.\nMany clubs also offload players to help fund spending.\nReal Madrid are a case in point - recouping half of what they paid for Bale by selling German international Mesut Ozil to Premier League Arsenal.\nIndeed, the total invested by Premier League clubs comes down to 400 million pounds when proceeds from sales such as that of Bale are factored in.\nSpanish clubs actually generated a surplus of 95 million pounds from player trading this summer, according to Deloitte, while clubs from Italy's cash-strapped Serie A also posted a small profit.\nReblog\nQuestion:\nAccording to a survey carried out by Deloittes early in 2009, which was the world's richest soccer club at that time?\nAnswer:\nReal madrid cf\nPassage:\nRoyal Parks of London\nThe Royal Parks of London are lands originally owned by the monarchy of the United Kingdom for the recreation (mostly hunting) of the royal family. They are part of the hereditary possessions of The Crown.\n\nParks\n\nWith increasing urbanisation of London, some of these were preserved as freely accessible open space and became public parks with the introduction of the Crown Lands Act 1851. There are today eight parks formally described by this name and they cover almost  2000 ha of land in Greater London.\n\n* Bushy Park, 445 ha  \n* Green Park, 19 ha  \n* Greenwich Park, 74 ha  \n* Hyde Park, 142 ha  \n* Kensington Gardens, 111 ha  \n* Regent's Park, 166 ha  \n* Richmond Park, 955 hectares   (2360 acre)\n* St. James's Park, 23 ha  \n\nHyde Park and Kensington Gardens (which are adjacent), Green Park, Regent's Park and St James's Park are the largest green spaces in central London. Bushy Park, Greenwich Park and Richmond Park are in the suburbs. The Royal Parks agency also manages Brompton Cemetery, Grosvenor Square Gardens, Victoria Tower Gardens and the gardens of 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street. \n\nHampton Court Park is also a royal park within Greater London, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks. \n\nLegal position\n\nThe public does not have any legal right to use the Parks, as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, although there are public rights of way across the land. The Royal Parks Agency manages the Royal Parks under powers derived from section 22 of the Crown Lands Act 1851. As part of its statutory management function the Agency permits the public to use the Parks for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under the Parks Regulation Acts 1872\u20131926 which are considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within the Parks. The current regulations are the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.\n\nManagement\n\nThey are managed by The Royal Parks (an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and are policed by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing the parks, the Royal Parks Constabulary, has been abolished). The main form of funding for the Royal Parks is a central government grant. This contrasts with most of London's other parks, which are funded by local borough councils. The Royal Parks generate additional income from commercial activities such as catering and staging public events such as concerts.\n\nThe Royal Parks Foundation is a registered charity which raises funds to protect, support and create new opportunities within the Parks. They have a number of membership schemes such as adoption and champion programmes.\n\nMayoral control\n\nIn 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that control over the Royal Parks should be devolved to the Greater London Authority  and the government put forward proposals for that to happen later on that year.  The plan was welcomed by Royal Parks but it is yet to be implemented following the 2012 London Olympic games.\nQuestion:\nIf the eight Royal Parks in London are arranged alphabetically which comes last?\nAnswer:\nSt. James's\nPassage:\nDrawing pin\nA thumb tack (North American English) or push pin is a short nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and intended to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are used to refer to different designs intended for various purpose. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively.  These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation.  Drawing pin or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on drawing boards. Map pin or map tack refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations on a map and to hold the map in place.\n\nHistory\n\nEdwin Moore invented the \"push-pin\" in 1900 and founded the Moore Push-Pin Company. Moore described the push-pin as a pin with a handle.  Later, in 1904, in Lychen, German clockmaker Johann Kirsten invented flat-headed thumb tacks for use with drawings. \n\nDesign\n\nA thumb tack has two basic components: the head, often made of plastic, metal or  wood, and the body, usually made of steel or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the tack in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as hearts or stars. Thumb tack heads also come in a variety of colors. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some thumb tack designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a tack.\n\nDomed or gripped heads are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed tacks will point upward, posing a hazard.  Thumb tacks also pose a hazard of ingestion and choking, where they may do serious harm.\nQuestion:\nWhat do we call what the Americans call a thumb tack?\nAnswer:\nMap pin\n\n\nPassage:\nThe Story Behind Sammy Hagar\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Drive 55\u2033\nThe Story Behind Sammy Hagar\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Drive 55\u2033\nThe Story Behind Sammy Hagar\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Drive 55\u2033\nBy John Robinson June 16, 2015 1:44 PM\n\u00a0\nCourtesy of Geffen Records\nQ: Did Sammy Hagar do the song I CAN\u2019T DRIVE 55 because he got stopped by the cops so many times?\nA: The song was based on an incident that happened to Sammy while he was driving from Albany, New York to Lake Placid.

It derives from the parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament.  In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal.  Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions.  Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father \"kills the fatted calf\" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.\n\nIn modern usage, \"killing the fatted calf\" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song \"Bennie and the Jets\".\nQuestion:\n\"In the Bible, whose return heralded the killing of \"\"the fatted calf\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nLoving Father\nPassage:\nKingdom of the Algarve\nThe Kingdom of the Algarve (Portuguese: Reino do Algarve, from the Arabic Gharb al-Andalus\u063a\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633), later the Kingdom of the Algarves (Portuguese: Reino dos Algarves), was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nIt was the second dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal, though in fact the Algarvian kingdom had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy. \nIn actuality, it was just an honorific title for the Algarve based on its history and was very similar to the rest of the Portuguese provinces. \n\nThe title King of Silves was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of Silves in 1189. As this conquest did not take all of the Algarve, D. Sancho never used the title King of Portugal and the Algarve, but instead it was adopted by his grandson Afonso III of Portugal as a part of the titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown.\n\nHistory\n\nReconquista\n\nDuring the Reconquista, Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to take lands from the Muslims that they claimed as theirs. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King Afonso III of Portugal.\n\nFirst conquest\n\nIn 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered Silves, one of the most prosperous cities in Al-Andalus, aligned at the time with the Almohad Caliphate. Portuguese control over Silves would be short, with the Almohads conquering the city again in 1191 in a massive counter-attack led by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur the Almohad Caliph in person.\n\nThe conquest of Algarve\n\nWith the decline of the Almohads, the southern taifa city-states united under a single Emir, M\u00fbs\u00e2 Ibn Muhammad Ibn Nassir Ibn Mahf\u00fbz, former governor of Niebla, and known among the Christians as Aben Mafom.\n\nAben Mafom, King of Niebla and Emir of Algarve, trying to counter the achievements made by the Portuguese in their territories, declared vassalage to Alfonso X of Castile (who thus titled himself the King of the Algarve). Through his vassals, Alfonso X hoped to claim dominion over the Algarve not yet conquered by the Portuguese. \n\nThe Emir's vow of vassalage to Castille however did not stop the knights of the Order of Santiago, under the command of the Grand-Master Paio Peres Correia, from conquering most of the region city by city, between 1242 and 1249, including Silves. In March 1249, King Afonso III of Portugal captured Faro, the last Muslim stronghold in Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista.\n\nThe entitlement of Afonso III of Portugal as King of Portugal and the Algarve would serve as a reaction to Alfonso X of Castile's claim to the Algarve and was designed to demonstrate the rights of the Portuguese monarch on the region concerned.\n\nThe issue between the sovereigns of Castille and Portugal was eventually settled by the Treaty of Badajoz (1267), where King Alfonso X gave up his claims of the Algarve, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne of the Algarve, which dictated the terms of its incorporation into the Portuguese crown. The treaty, though, allowed the use of the title of King of the Algarve for King Alfonso X and his descendants, since King Alfonso X had acquired the territories of Al-Gharb Al-Andalus on the other side of the Guadiana river. The kings of Castile, and then Spain, would add the title to their repertoire of titles until the ascent of Queen Isabel II of Spain to the throne.\n\nAge of Discoveries\n\nDuring the Age of Discoveries, the Algarve served as the location for the embarkment for many voyages, mainly those funded by the Infante D. Henrique. Prince Henry also set up his famous school of navigation at Sagres Point, though the idea of a real school building and campus is highly disputed. Most of the voyages set sail from Lagos.\n\nThe Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\n\nThe name of the Algarvian Kingdom suffered some minor changes due to the Portuguese North African conquests, which were considered an extension of the kingdom of Algarve. John I of Portugal added to the title of \"King of Portugal and the Algarve\", the title \"Lord of Ceuta\", and his grandson Afonso V of Portugal, in turn, styled himself \"Lord of Ceuta and Alcacer-Ceguer in Africa\" (after 1458). The 1471 conquest of Asilah, Tangiers and Larache, together with North African previous holdings, led to the creation of the title \"the Algarves from either side of the sea in Africa\", leaving the European Algarve to become \"the Algarve behind the sea.\"\n\nThus, it was not until 1471 that \"the Kingdom of the Algarve\" led to \"the Kingdom of the Algarves\", due to the increase of Portuguese possessions in Northern Africa, which were made as possessions of the Kingdom of the Algarve. The Portuguese monarchs therefore adopted the title that they would use until the fall of the monarchy in 1910: \"Kings of Portugal and the Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\". The title would continue to be used even after the abandonment of the last North African holding in Mazagan (Portuguese: Mazag\u00e3o; lost by Portugal in 1769).\n\n19th century conflicts\n\nDuring the 19th century, a serious clash between liberals and Miguelites, caused an exodus of people from the Algarvian inlands to the coastal cities. Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Sousa Reis, the Remexido, and fought in the inlands and attacked the coastal cities, bringing the urban population into turmoil. The turmoil of the Algarve intensified in the years between 1834 and 1838, when the Algarve saw battles on a level it had never seen before. On November 26, 1836, Miguel I of Portugal named Remexido Governor of the Kingdom of the Algarve and Acting Commander in Chief of all the Royalist Troops, Regular and Irregular Armies, and the Operations in the South. Remexido, however, was shot in Faro on August 2, 1838.\nQuestion:\n\"In which country is the area called \"\"the Algarve\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nPortoga\u0142o\nPassage:\nNanosecond\nA nanosecond (ns) is a SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (10 or 1/1,000,000,000 s). One nanosecond is to one second as one second is to 31.71\u00a0years.\n\nThe word nanosecond is formed by the prefix nano and the unit second. Its symbol is ns.\n\nA nanosecond is equal to 1000\u00a0picoseconds or \u00a0microsecond.  Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10 and 10 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds.\n\nTimes of this magnitude are commonly encountered in telecommunications, pulsed lasers and some areas of electronics.\n\nLight travels exactly 29.9792458 \u00a0centimeters in 1\u00a0nanosecond. This is equivalent to 11.8\u00a0inches, leading some to refer to a nanosecond as a light-foot.  A light-foot is actually ~1.0167033621639674471063578257196\u00a0nanoseconds. \nThe earliest use of the term is by George Gamow.  Another early reference commonly given  is to Admiral Grace Hopper, who used to give out pieces of wire about a foot long to illustrate the eventual problem of building very high speed computers.   If it takes light a nanosecond to go a foot (in a vacuum, slower in copper), then a computer built with parts connected by half this distance, 15 cm of wire, would take at least a nanosecond to send data to a part and get a response.  The solution, developed in Hopper's lifetime, was first the integrated circuit and later the multi-core processor.\n\n\"Once she presented a piece of wire about a foot long, and explained that it represented a nanosecond, since it was the maximum distance electricity could travel in wire in one-billionth of a second. She often contrasted this nanosecond with a microsecond - a coil of wire nearly a thousand feet long - as she encouraged programmers not to waste even a microsecond.\"\n\nCommon measurements \n\n* 0.5 nanoseconds (0.5\u00a0ns) \u2013 the average life of a molecule of positronium hydride\n* 1.0 nanosecond \u2013 cycle time for radio frequency 1\u00a0GHz (1 hertz), an inverse unit.

It is still used for special occasions.\n\nTo \"lay a h\u0101ngi\" or \"put down a h\u0101ngi\" involves digging a pit in the ground, heating stones in the pit with a large fire, placing baskets of food on top of the stones, and covering everything with earth for several hours before uncovering (or lifting) the h\u0101ngi. \n\nThere are many variations and details that can be altered. H\u0101ngi \"experts\" have developed and improved methods that often, like the stones themselves, have been handed down for generations. Another name sometimes used is umu, for instance the umu t\u012b, used in the South Island to cook Cabbage trees (Cordyline australis). \n\nThe evolution of h\u0101ngi methods \n\nEvidence from early Polynesian settler sites in New Zealand such as Wairau Bar and in coastal Otago Peninsula from about 1280 shows a significant number of large cooking pits or umu which were designed to cook Ti-pore or various species of Cordyline. This was a common east Polynesian practice in the Cook Islands and Society Islands. The remains of large umu have also been found in the Kermadec Islands. The .900 long, carrot shaped tap root was cooked in a large stone lined pit for between 1 and 2 days. Various sources say it was baked while some say steamed. The result was a fibrous mass of sweet pulp that had a bitter after taste. Investigation in Otago shows that most pits were used only once or perhaps twice before making a new pit. Some sources say the longer the cooking, the sweeter the pulp. This may have been due to the evaporation of the water content. The distinguishing feature of a Ti- pore was its large size compared to a normal cooking earth oven.  \nPrior to colonisation and the introduction of metals and wire, food was laid out on clean sticks, bark, large leaves and other vegetation to minimize direct contact with the hot rocks and reduce burning. Carved bowls and flat rocks were also used for this purpose.\nLeaves, sticks and vegetation were used to cover the food and to prevent crushing from the weight of the earth on top.\n\nMany different h\u0101ngi methods are now used. Wire baskets became widely used in the early 19th century with sacking and cloth replacing leaves and bark as the covering of choice. Red hot iron or steel may be used in addition to or instead of stones.\n\nIn the early 21st century, gas heated stainless steel \"h\u0101ngi machines\" are sometimes used to replicate the style of cooking without the need for a wood fire, rocks and a pit.\nQuestion:\nHangi is a traditional New Zealand Maori method of cooking using a?\nAnswer:\nPit\nPassage:\nPholadidae\nPholadidae, known as piddocks or angelwings, are a family of bivalve mollusc similar to a clam.\n\nBackground\n\nPidocks are unique in that each side of their shells is divided into 2 or 3 separate sections. Furthermore, one of the piddock's shells has a set of ridges or \"teeth\", which they use to grind away at clay or soft rock and create tubular burrows. The shape of these burrows is due to the rotating motion of the piddock as it grinds the rock to make its home. The piddock stays in the burrow it digs for the entirety of its eight-year lifespan, with only its siphon exposed to take in water that it filters for food. When the piddock dies and leaves an empty tubular burrow, other marine life such as sea anemone, crabs and other molluscs may use the burrow.\n\nSome species of Pholadidae may reach up to 18\u00a0cm (7\u2033). Their coloration is typically white, though through consumption of red tide algae some may develop a pink coloration.\n\n* The angelwing species Cyrtopleura costata has approximately 26 radiating ribs. Growth lines run horizontally over the surface of the shell. Angelwings have a spoon-shaped brace under the beak of the shell, called the apophysis, where the mollusc's foot muscles are attached. Cyrtopleura costata possesses long siphons which protrude from its burrow and circulate water as the source for its food supply. It cannot retract its siphons into the protection of its shell, so the two valves can never shut completely. The muscles fusing the shell's valves together are weak, making it rare to find angelwings with both halves still intact. Some shell hunters dig for the living clam, and if dug up, the fragile shell must be placed immediately into a container of water or it will close and shatter. The angelwing's shell is popular with collectors, as well as a delicious food staple. The angelwing lives offshore and in estuaries, sometimes as much as a metre (three feet) deep in the mud or clay.\n* The Atlantic mud-piddock, Barnea truncata, often referred to as the fallen angelwing, is classed among the angelwing varieties, growing up to 5.7\u00a0cm (2\u00bc\u2033) and is similar to other angelwings but with weaker sculpture. One end is squared off and the other end pointed. Loose accessory plates are located above the hinge on live specimens. It possesses a white exterior and interior. It burrows into mud, clay or softwood. Occasionally it is washed onto sounds and ocean beaches, and has a habitat range from Maine to Brazil. This fragile shell is rarely dug from mud without breaking. It burrows deeply and has long, united siphons.\n* The false angelwing Petricola pholadiformis, is also classed among varieties of angelwing, growing up to 7\u00a0cm (2\u00be\u2033). It has a thin, elongate shell resembling a small angelwing but lacks the rolled-out hinge area. Its beak is at one end of the shell with strong radial ribbing on the beak end. Teeth are located on hinge and a deep pallial sinus and partially united siphons. It has a white exterior and interior. It typically burrows into hard surfaces such as clay or peat in intertidal zones. It is commonly found on sounds and ocean beaches with a range from Canada to Uruguay.\n* The common piddock (Pholas dactylus) is known for its bioluminescence[http://www.marlin.ac.uk/species/Pholasdactylus.htm Basic information for Pholas dactylus (Common piddock)]  and was investigated by Rapha\u00ebl Dubois in his 1887 discovery of luciferin.\n\nGenera and selected species\n\n* Genus Barnea Risso, 1826\n** Barnea candida Linnaeus, 1758\n** Barnea fragilis\n** Barnea manilensis (Philippi, 1847)\n** Barnea parva Pennant, 1777\n** Barnea similis (Gray, 1835)\n** Barnea subtruncata (G.

The great thing about a watch is that you can incorporate different gems with it.\u00a0 Whether it is a diamond or ruby studded watch or a Mickey Mouse watch, it can bring a sense of tradition to your anniversary celebration.\nGEMSTONE:Rubies are the second hardest gemstone only to a diamond. Rubies can range in color from orange-red to purple-red. The more red a ruby is the more sought after the stone is. As far back as ancient times the ruby has been thought to enable people to predict the future as well as stop bleeding. More recently, rubies were used to make the first laser. Rubies are an alternative to diamonds when it comes to engagement rings. When worn on the left hand, rubies are said to bring good luck.\nFLOWER: The rose is the flower associated with the 15th anniversary. Red roses are the traditional bouquet given to symbolize love. Red roses stand for love and deep passion, lavender roses stand for majesty, white \u00a0for purity or innocence and orange roses stand for energy and fascination.\u00a0 Whether it is a full bouquet or a single red rose, this lovely flower can add an elegant touch to your 15th wedding anniversary.\nQuestion:\nWhat gift is traditionally given on a fifteenth wedding anniversary\nAnswer:\n18k Gold Watch\nPassage:\nClouds Hill\nClouds Hill is an isolated cottage near Wareham in the county of Dorset in South West England. It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. The site is in\nthe parish of Turners Puddle in Purbeck District.\n\nHistory\n\nThe small building has colourwashed brick walls and a tiled roof. It was probably built as forester's cottage in the early 19th century.  The lintel over the door now bears a Greek inscription \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 (\"Why Worry\"). It is now a Grade II* listed building as \"Clouds Hill (Lawrence of Arabia's Cottage)\"; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015. \n\nLawrence first rented the cottage in 1923 while stationed at nearby Bovington Camp with the Tank Corps.  He made it habitable with the help of a friend, then bought it in 1925 and used it as a holiday home. He described it as an earthly paradise and wrote \"Nothing in Clouds Hill is to be a care upon the world. While I have it there shall be nothing exquisite or unique in it. Nothing to anchor me.\" The cottage had no electric lights and three living rooms, described as an eating room, book room and music room. For heat insulation Lawrence had the eating room lined with asbestos that was covered in aluminium foil, and he kept his food under glass domes. In the book room he installed a large leather divan, and in the music room above it he had his gramophone \"with a huge amplifier horn\", a leather sofa and chair.\n\nIn 1935 Lawrence left the Royal Air Force and lived at Clouds Hill. A few weeks later, at the age of 46, he suffered severe head injuries in a motorcycle accident close to the cottage, and died in the Bovington Camp hospital on 19 May 1935. The following year, his heir, his brother A. W. Lawrence gave Clouds Hill to the National Trust. It is now a museum, dedicated to Lawrence. It is open to visitors from the end of March to the beginning of October, Thursday \u2013 Sunday.\n\nThe cottage remains largely as Lawrence left it at his death.  It features an exhibition detailing Lawrence's life, and most of his original furniture and possessions. The cottage reflects his complex personality and links to the Middle East.\n\nThe circular Lawrence of Arabia Trail starts and finishes at Bovington's The Tank Museum, taking in Clouds Hill and the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church in Moreton, Lawrence's final resting place. \n\nSleeping bags\n\nLawrence reserved a sleeping bag for guests and visitors who stayed overnight. In 1965 it was stolen. The bag's disappearance coincided with the release of Lawrence of Arabia, the film which popularised his story and it was thought the theft could have been inspired by the publicity and excitement generated by the film.\n\nIn 2001, the sleeping bag was returned. The Independent reported: \n\n\"The sleeping bag that served as a guest bed to some of the 20th century's most distinguished authors at TE Lawrence's weekend retreat has been returned 36 years after it was stolen. National Trust custodians of Clouds Hill, the author's cottage in Dorset, were amazed when a weather-beaten package from Belgium arrived containing the sleeping bag, along with a sheepish note that read: 'This is yours'. The bag, embroidered with the word 'tuum' ['yours'], was provided for guests at the cottage, while Lawrence slept on the floor in the other sleeping bag, marked 'meum' ['mine']. According to Jeremy Wilson, Lawrence's biographer, tuum's occupants included George Bernard Shaw, E. M. Forster and Robert Graves\"  \n\nAddress\n\n[http://maps.google.com/maps?fq&hl\nen&qClouds+Hill,+Wareham,+Dorset+BH20+7NQ&sll\n50.718988,-2.251682&sspn0.012227,0.043259&ie\nUTF8&z11&ll\n50.735586,-2.251511&spn0.19556,0.692139&om\n1&iwloc=addr Clouds Hill]\nWareham, Dorset BH20 7NQ\nTelephone: 01929 405616\nQuestion:\nWhich 20th century soldier and adventurer lived at Clouds Hill, Dorset?\nAnswer:\nT E Lawrence\nPassage:\nFougasse (bread)\nIn French cuisine, fougasse is a type of bread typically associated with Provence but found (with variations) in other regions. Some versions are sculpted or slashed into a pattern resembling an ear of wheat.\n\nHistory and etymology\n\nIn ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flatbread baked in the ashes of the hearth (focus in Latin).  This became a diverse range of breads that include focaccia in Italian cuisine, hogaza in Spain, fogassa in Catalonia, fug\u00e0ssa in Ligurian, poga\u010da in the Balkans, pog\u00e1csa in Hungary, fougasse in Provence (originally spelled fogatza), fouace or fou\u00e9e in other French regions and on the Channel Islands.  The Provence version is more likely to have additions in the form of olives, cheese, or anchovies, which may be regarded as a primitive form of pizza without the tomato.\n\nThere is also in Portugal the foga\u00e7a, a sweet bread. In Brazil, p\u00e3o sovado is a typical big fougasse, while a recipe, typical of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Esp\u00edrito Santo and surrounding regions, that is halfway between fougasse and bolillo (in these regions known as p\u00e3o franc\u00eas or p\u00e3o-de-sal), somewhat resembling a savory small brioche, is called p\u00e3o su\u00ed\u00e7o. They are perhaps the sweetest of savory artisanal bread recipes commonly made in Brazil.\n\nFougasse was traditionally used to assess the temperature of a wood fired oven. The time it would take to bake gives an idea of the oven temperature and whether the rest of the bread can be loaded.\n\nFougasse is also a type of pastry from Monaco that is topped with almonds and nuts.\n\nUse in dishes\n\nIt is used to make the French version of calzone, which can have cheese and small squarish strips of bacon inside the pocket made by folding over the bread. Other variations include dried fruit, Roquefort and nuts or olives and goat cheese. It is known by extension as a fougasse even though it is more a sandwich than just a type of bread.\nQuestion:\nFougasse, associated with Provence, is what type of food?\nAnswer:\nSomun\nPassage:\nWaterborne diseases\nWaterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. Infection commonly results during bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food, or the consumption of food thus infected. Various forms of waterborne diarrheal disease probably are the most prominent examples, and affect mainly children in developing countries; according to the World Health Organization, such diseases account for an estimated 4.1% of the total DALY global burden of disease, and cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. \n\nOverview\n\nThe term \"waterborne disease\" is reserved largely for infections that predominantly are transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water. Trivially, many infections may be transmitted by microbes or parasites that accidentally, possibly as a result of exceptional circumstances, have entered the water, but the fact that there might be an occasional freak infection need not mean that it is useful to categorise the resulting disease as \"waterborne\". Nor is it common practice to refer to diseases such as malaria as \"waterborne\" just because mosquitoes have aquatic phases in their life cycles, or because treating the water they inhabit happens to be an effective strategy in control of the mosquitoes that are the vectors.\n\nMicroorganisms causing diseases that characteristically are waterborne prominently include protozoa and bacteria, many of which are intestinal parasites, or invade the tissues or circulatory system through walls of the digestive tract. Various other waterborne diseases are caused by viruses. (In spite of philosophical difficulties associated with defining viruses as \"organisms\", it is practical and convenient to regard them as microorganisms in this connection.)\n\nYet other important classes of water-borne diseases are caused by metazoan parasites. Typical examples include certain Nematoda, that is to say \"roundworms\". As an example of water-borne Nematode infections, one important waterborne nematodal disease is Dracunculiasis. It is acquired by swallowing water in which certain copepoda occur that act as vectors for the Nematoda. Anyone swallowing a copepod that happens to be infected with Nematode larvae in the genus Dracunculus, becomes liable to infection. The larvae cause guinea worm disease. \n\nAnother class of waterborne metazoan pathogens are certain members of the Schistosomatidae, a family of blood flukes. They usually infect victims that make skin contact with the water. Blood flukes are pathogens that cause Schistosomiasis of various forms, more or less seriously affecting hundreds of millions of people world-wide. \n\nLong before modern studies had established the germ theory of disease, or any advanced understanding of the nature of water as a vehicle for transmitting disease, traditional beliefs had cautioned against the consumption of water, rather favouring processed beverages such as beer, wine and tea. For example, in the camel caravans that crossed Central Asia along the Silk Road, the explorer Owen Lattimore noted, \"The reason we drank so much tea was because of the bad water. Water alone, unboiled, is never drunk. There is a superstition that it causes blisters on the feet.\" \n\nSocioeconomic impact\n\nWaterborne diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, locally as well as internationally. People who are infected by a waterborne disease are usually confronted with related costs and not seldom with a huge financial burden. This is especially the case in less developed countries. The financial losses are mostly caused by e.g. costs for medical treatment and medication, costs for transport, special food, and by the loss of manpower. Many families must even sell their land to pay for treatment in a proper hospital. On average, a family spends about 10% of the monthly households income per person infected. \n\nInfections by type of pathogen \n\nProtozoan \n\nParasitic \n\nBacterial \n\n*\n\nViral \n\n*\n\nAlgal \n\n*\nQuestion:\nThe devastating water-borne disease Schistosomiasis, or Snail Fever, is more commonly called what?\nAnswer:\nGenital schistosomiasis\nPassage:\nRochebaron\nRochebaron is a soft blue cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk, in the town of Beauzac in the Auvergne region, in the Massif Central, France.\n\nThis cheese is one of several that are made by curdling milk and separating the curds from the whey. Pressed into moulds, Rochebaron is then pierced with wires impregnated with Penicillium glaucum to produce blue veins through the soft whitish body of the cheese.

The         term 'Patron' is used in Christian religions,         including the Roman Catholic religion, to describe         holy and virtuous men and women who are considered         to be a defender of a specific group of people or of         a country. There is a patron for virtually every         cause, country, profession or special interest.         There are two categories of saints: martyrs and         confessors. A martyr is one who is put to death for         his Christian faith or convictions.\n\u00a0\nFast, concise facts and information about Saint Alban\nThe following provides fast and concise facts and information:\nThe patron of Converts and refugees\nMemorial Day / Feast Day: June 22nd\nDate of Death: Saint Alban died in 305\nSt. Alban was born in the Roman town Verulamium (now Saint Albans) in Hertfordshire, England\nCause of Death: Beheaded\nWho or what is Saint Alban the patron saint of?\nSaint Alban is the patron of converts and refugees. St. Alban was the first English martyr. Meanings, definition and origins - a patron is considered to be a defender of a specific group of people or of a nation. There is a patron for virtually every cause, profession or special interest. Prayers are considered more likely to be answered by asking a patron for intercession on their behalf. St. Alban is represented by a sword and a fountain, because, when he reached the summit of the hill where he was to be beheaded, he prayed for water to quench his thirst, and immediately a spring appeared at his feet. His burial-place was afterwards revealed to King Offa, who erected a shrine over his remains at what is now St. Albans, in Hertfordshire.\nWhy is Saint Alban the patron of Converts and refugees?\nWhy is Saint Alban is the patron of Converts and refugees? St Alban was a Roman soldier who was converted to the Christian faith and became the the first English martyr for his convictions.\nDeath of Saint Alban\nThere are two categories of saints: martyrs and confessors. A Christian martyr is regarded as one who is put to death for his Christian faith or convictions. Confessors are people who died natural deaths. Date of Death: Saint Alban died in 305. Cause of Death - he was Beheaded.\u00a0\nHow Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art\nIt is helpful to be able to recognise Saint Alban in paintings, stained glass windows, illuminated manuscripts, architecture and other forms of Christian art. The artistic representations reflect the life or death of saints, or an aspect of life with which the person is most closely associated. Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art with a sword and a fountain.\nFeast Day of Saint Alban\nThe Feast Day of Saint Alban is June 22nd. The origin of Feast Days: most saints have specially designated feast days and are associated with a specific day of the year and these are referred to as the saint's feast day. The feast days first arose from the very early Christian custom of the annual commemoration of martyrs on the dates of their deaths at the same time celebrating their birth into heaven.\n\u00a0\nHistory, Life, Biography, Facts and Information about Saint Alban\nFast, concise facts and information about Saint Alban\nWhat is Saint Alban the patron of?\nDate of Death: 305\nQuestion:\nWho was the first English Christian martyr - his feast day is June 22nd.?\nAnswer:\nAlban, Saint\nPassage:\nWomen's Cricket World Cup\nThe ICC Women's Cricket World Cup is the premier international championship of women's One Day International cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was originally administered by the International Women's Cricket Council until the two associations merged in 2005. The first tournament was held in England in 1973, two years before the first men's tournament.\n\nParticipation in the tournament has varied through the eight competitions: fifteen different teams have played, but only Australia, England and New Zealand have appeared in every tournament. India have appeared in all but two of the competitions. Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Young England have all appeared in just one tournament: in each case, the first competition, in 1973.\n\nThe most recent tournament, the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, was held in India for the third time in February. In the final Australia beat West Indies by 114 runs at the Brabourne Stadium.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst World Cup\n\nWomen's international cricket was first played in 1934, when a party from England toured Australia and New Zealand. The first Test match was played on 28\u201331 December 1934, and was won by England.  The first Test against New Zealand followed early the following year. These three nations remained the only Test playing teams in women's cricket until 1960, when South Africa played a number of matches against England. Limited overs cricket was first played by first-class teams in England in 1962.  Nine years later, the first international one day match was played in men's cricket, when England took on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. \n\nTalks began in 1971 about holding a World Cup for women's cricket, led by Jack Hayward.  South Africa, under pressure from the world for their apartheid laws, were not invited to take part in the competition.  Both of the other two Test playing nations, Australia and New Zealand were invited. Hayward had previously organised tours of the West Indies by England women, and it was from this region that the other two competing nations were drawn; Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago. To make up the numbers, England also fielded a \"Young England\" team, and an \"International XI\" was also included. Five South Africans were invited to play for the International XI as a means of compensation for the team not being invited, but these invitations were later withdrawn.\n\nThe inaugural tournament was held at a variety of venues across England in June and July 1973,  two years before the first men's Cricket World Cup was played.  The competition was played as a round-robin tournament, and the last scheduled match was England against Australia. Australia went into the game leading the table by a solitary point: they had won four matches and had one abandoned. England had also won four matches, but they had lost to New Zealand.  As a result, the match also served as a de facto final for the competition. England won the match, held at Edgbaston, Birmingham by 92 runs to win the tournament. \n\nResults\n\nBy year\n\nBy team\n\n;Legend\n* \u2013 Champions\n* \u2013 Runners-up\n* \u2013 Third place\n* \u2013 Losing semi-finalist (no third-place playoff)\n*QF \u2013 Losing quarter-finalist (no further playoffs)\n*1R \u2013 First round\n*\u00a0\u2014 Hosts\n\nRecords\nQuestion:\nWho won the Women's Cricket World Cup played at Sydney, Australia, in 2009?\nAnswer:\nEnglnad\nPassage:\nMen's Fastest Mile Times (World Records) - About.com Sports\nWorld Records for Men's Fastest Mile Times\nBy Mike Rosenbaum\nUpdated September 23, 2016.\nIt\u2019s never been an Olympic or World Championship event, yet the mile remains the only non-metric race distance in which the IAAF recognizes a world record. Long after the other non-metric distances have vanished from the world record books, those 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards \u2013 or about 1.61 kilometers \u2013 continue to capture the imaginations of runners and fans alike as a premier middle distance event.\nThe first IAAF-recognized world record in the mile was run by John Paul Jones of the U.S. No, the record doesn\u2019t go back to the American Revolution. This John Paul Jones performed his feat on May 31, 1913, in Allston, Mass., where he completed the mile in 4:14.4. France\u2019s Jules Ladoumegue later brought the mark under 4:10, running 4:09.2 on Oct. 4, 1931, in Paris. The mark crept down toward the 4-minute mark throughout the 1940s. In a 3-year period from July 1942 through July 1945 a pair of Swedes, Gunder Hagg, and Arne Andersson, exchanged the record six times.\ncontinue reading below our video\nUnderstanding Baseball\nHagg ended the give-and-take with a time of 4:01.4 on July 17, 1945. His mark stood for almost nine years, during which time the pundits debated on whether a 4-minute mile was humanly possible, as a runner after runner tried and failed to crack a key psychological \u2013 and, as some believed, physical \u2013 barrier.\nThe 4-Minute Mile:\nOn May 6, 1954, great Britain\u2019s Roger Bannister answered the questions by running the first sub-4:00 miles, finishing in 3:59.4 while assisted by a pair of pacemakers. Bannister, then a medical student, developed his own training methods \u2013 featuring relatively short, intense workouts \u2013 that carried him through on a windy day. Bannister ran lap times of 57.5, 60.7, 62.3 and 58.9 seconds. He was timed in 3:43.0 through 1500 meters.\nWhile Bannister is famous for shattering the 4-minute barrier, many forget that he held the title for less than seven weeks before Australia\u2019s John Landy finished in 3:58.0 on June 21, 1954. Bannister retired from racing before the end of the year, to devote himself to medicine, but not before racing against Landy in \u201cThe Mile of the Century\u201d in Vancouver that August. Landy shot in front by the end of the first lap, hoping to wear out the normally fast-finishing Bannister. But Bannister ran his own race, paced himself, then shot into the lead with less than 90 yards remaining to win in 3:58.8 to Landy\u2019s 3:59.6, the first time two runners topped four minutes in the same race.\nIn 1958 Australia\u2019s Herb Elliott ran 3:54.5 to break the record set the previous year by Derek Ibbotson by 2.7 seconds, the biggest drop in the world record time during the IAAF era.\nThe record returned to U.S. soil in 1966 when the precocious Jim Ryun posted a 3:51.3 time, which he lowered to 3:51.1 the following year. Ryun was the first high school runner to break four minutes, with a time of 3:59 in 1964. At age 18 he owned the U.S. mile record of 3:55.3. At 19 he owned the world record. He was the fourth and, as of 2012, the last American to reign as the mile\u2019s world record-holder.\nJohn Walker Cracks 3:50:\nNew Zealand\u2019s John Walker took the record below 3:50 in August 1975 with a time of 3:49.4, fulfilling his promise to the organizers of the meet held in Goteborg, Sweden. Walker convinced meet officials to change the scheduled 1500-meter race to the mile, telling them he\u2019d take a shot at the world record. He was paced through the first half mile, with lap times of 55.8 and 59.3, then sped up on the final two laps, running the third quarter in 57.9 and the fourth in 56.4 seconds. Walker eventually became the first man to run 100 sub-4:00 miles.\nGreat Britain then enjoyed a stretch of 14 years in which three different British runners owned the mark. Just as Hagg and Andersson played give-and-go with the record in the \u201840s, so too did Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett in 1979-81. In a 25-month stretch, beginning in July 1979 when Coe edged Walker\u2019s mark by four-tenths of a second, Coe owned the record three times and Ovett twice. Coe began the British siege in only the third-mile race of his life, in an Oslo meet in which Walker participated. Coe finally prevailed in his duel with Ovett, as Coe\u2019s time of 3:47.33 set in August of 1981 lived for almost four years before Steve Cram lowered it to 3:46.32 in 1985.\nEl Guerrouj Takes Charge:\nOnly one African runner \u2013 Filbert Bayi, who broke Ryun\u2019s record and held the mile mark for just three months \u2013 had owned the mile record before Algeria\u2019s Noureddine Morceli topped Cram\u2019s mark by running 3:44.39 on Sept. 5, 1993. The 1.93-second drop in the record was the largest margin since Ryun set his first record in 1966. Morocco\u2019s Hicham El Guerrouj then lowered the mark to 3:43.13 on July 7, 1999 \u2013 almost identical to Bannister\u2019s 1500-meter time in 1954 \u2013 yet came close to losing the race, held in Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium. Noah Ngeny ran with El Guerrouj all the way and edged Morceli\u2019s record as well, finishing in 3:43.40. With his mark still intact in 2015, El Guerrouj has held the IAAF mile record longer than anyone else, while Ngeny\u2019s time remained No. 2 on the all-time list. As of 2015, El Guerrouj had seven of the top 10 mile times in history; Alan Webb owns the fastest mile of the 21st century by someone other than El Guerrouj, posting a time of 3:46.91 in 2007.\nRead more about:\nQuestion:\nWho was the first man to break three and a half minutes for the 1500 metres\nAnswer:\nStephen Cram\nPassage:\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer ...\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\n* Premier League leads way as soccer clubs splash TV cash\n* Real Madrid and Barcelona defy Spain's economic downturn\n* Clubs seen complying with UEFA rules despite investment\nBy Keith Weir\nLONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European soccer clubs have reinvested cash from television deals to go on a record-breaking summer spending spree led by teams from the English Premier League and Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.\nClubs in the English top flight had spent 630 million pounds ($980.5 million) by the player transfer deadline on Monday night. Teams in the big European leagues must now wait until January before they can hire new players.\nThe spending by English clubs broke the 2008 record of 500 million pounds, according to figures compiled by business services group Deloitte, and underlined the Premier League's status as the world's richest national competition.\n\"As the financial rewards for participation and success in the Premier League increase, so it follows that clubs are investing on the pitch to ensure they continue to benefit from the remarkable Premier League growth story,\" Deloitte's Dan Jones said.\nChampions Manchester United and the other 19 Premier League teams are expected to share revenues of about 1.6 billion pounds this season thanks to enhanced television deals with BSkyB and BT in Britain, and broadcasters around the globe that began last month.\nIt was not all one-way traffic as the Premier League lost one of its biggest names when Real Madrid bought Welshman Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur for a world record 100 million euros ($132 million).\nNot to be outdone, Real's perennial rivals Barcelona spent $75 million to buy Brazil forward Neymar from Brazilian top division club Santos.\nPLAYING FAIR?\nSpending such sums might appear to defy logic given Spain's economic problems but Real and Barcelona enjoy the luxury of doing their own TV deals rather than pooling revenues as happens in England and other major leagues.\nThat has made the two clubs the world's richest in terms of revenues and allowed them to remain buyers when many of their Spanish rivals are forced to sell their best players.\nReal and Barcelona have TV deals with Spanish production and distribution company Mediapro. They both also have lucrative new main sponsorship deals this season - Barcelona with Qatar Airways and Real with the Emirates airline names on their kit.\nOverall spending levels may also raise eyebrows when loss-making clubs are supposed to be complying with new Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA, European soccer's governing body, to put soccer on a more stable footing.\n\"A lot of English clubs have gone on a spending spree but they haven't breached the Financial Fair Play rules as they are only spending what they have earned,\" said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports business at England's Coventry University.\nClubs also have the advantage of spreading the cost of a player's transfer over the duration of his contract in their accounts, lessening the impact on the bottom line.\nMany clubs also offload players to help fund spending.\nReal Madrid are a case in point - recouping half of what they paid for Bale by selling German international Mesut Ozil to Premier League Arsenal.\nIndeed, the total invested by Premier League clubs comes down to 400 million pounds when proceeds from sales such as that of Bale are factored in.\nSpanish clubs actually generated a surplus of 95 million pounds from player trading this summer, according to Deloitte, while clubs from Italy's cash-strapped Serie A also posted a small profit.\nReblog\nQuestion:\nAccording to a survey carried out by Deloittes early in 2009, which was the world's richest soccer club at that time?\nAnswer:\nReal madrid cf\nPassage:\nRoyal Parks of London\nThe Royal Parks of London are lands originally owned by the monarchy of the United Kingdom for the recreation (mostly hunting) of the royal family. They are part of the hereditary possessions of The Crown.\n\nParks\n\nWith increasing urbanisation of London, some of these were preserved as freely accessible open space and became public parks with the introduction of the Crown Lands Act 1851. There are today eight parks formally described by this name and they cover almost  2000 ha of land in Greater London.\n\n* Bushy Park, 445 ha  \n* Green Park, 19 ha  \n* Greenwich Park, 74 ha  \n* Hyde Park, 142 ha  \n* Kensington Gardens, 111 ha  \n* Regent's Park, 166 ha  \n* Richmond Park, 955 hectares   (2360 acre)\n* St. James's Park, 23 ha  \n\nHyde Park and Kensington Gardens (which are adjacent), Green Park, Regent's Park and St James's Park are the largest green spaces in central London. Bushy Park, Greenwich Park and Richmond Park are in the suburbs. The Royal Parks agency also manages Brompton Cemetery, Grosvenor Square Gardens, Victoria Tower Gardens and the gardens of 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street. \n\nHampton Court Park is also a royal park within Greater London, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks. \n\nLegal position\n\nThe public does not have any legal right to use the Parks, as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, although there are public rights of way across the land. The Royal Parks Agency manages the Royal Parks under powers derived from section 22 of the Crown Lands Act 1851. As part of its statutory management function the Agency permits the public to use the Parks for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under the Parks Regulation Acts 1872\u20131926 which are considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within the Parks. The current regulations are the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.\n\nManagement\n\nThey are managed by The Royal Parks (an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and are policed by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing the parks, the Royal Parks Constabulary, has been abolished). The main form of funding for the Royal Parks is a central government grant. This contrasts with most of London's other parks, which are funded by local borough councils. The Royal Parks generate additional income from commercial activities such as catering and staging public events such as concerts.\n\nThe Royal Parks Foundation is a registered charity which raises funds to protect, support and create new opportunities within the Parks. They have a number of membership schemes such as adoption and champion programmes.\n\nMayoral control\n\nIn 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that control over the Royal Parks should be devolved to the Greater London Authority  and the government put forward proposals for that to happen later on that year.  The plan was welcomed by Royal Parks but it is yet to be implemented following the 2012 London Olympic games.\nQuestion:\nIf the eight Royal Parks in London are arranged alphabetically which comes last?\nAnswer:\nSt. James's\nPassage:\nDrawing pin\nA thumb tack (North American English) or push pin is a short nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and intended to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are used to refer to different designs intended for various purpose. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively.  These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation.  Drawing pin or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on drawing boards. Map pin or map tack refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations on a map and to hold the map in place.\n\nHistory\n\nEdwin Moore invented the \"push-pin\" in 1900 and founded the Moore Push-Pin Company. Moore described the push-pin as a pin with a handle.  Later, in 1904, in Lychen, German clockmaker Johann Kirsten invented flat-headed thumb tacks for use with drawings. \n\nDesign\n\nA thumb tack has two basic components: the head, often made of plastic, metal or  wood, and the body, usually made of steel or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the tack in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as hearts or stars. Thumb tack heads also come in a variety of colors. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some thumb tack designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a tack.\n\nDomed or gripped heads are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed tacks will point upward, posing a hazard.  Thumb tacks also pose a hazard of ingestion and choking, where they may do serious harm.\nQuestion:\nWhat do we call what the Americans call a thumb tack?\nAnswer:\nMap pin\n", "answers": ["55", "fifty-five"], "pred": "#26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26 #26", "length": 9233, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1f4fecc3601c6f6fd6eb04d9996d67dc8c27b9eb4442fecb"}
{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nVictory in Europe Day\nVictory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces.  It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspr\u00e4sident Karl D\u00f6nitz. The administration headed by D\u00f6nitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. \n\nCelebrations \n\nUpon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.\nIn the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. \n\nIn the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was \"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\" Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. \n\nMassive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square. \n\nSoviet Victory Day \n\nAs the Soviet representative in Reims had no authority to sign the German instrument of surrender, the Soviet leadership proposed to consider Reims surrender as a \"preliminary\" act. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.\n\nCommemorative public holidays \n\n(May 8 unless otherwise stated)\n* Italy (25 April) \"Festa della Liberazione\" (Liberation Holiday).\n* Denmark (5 May) as \"Befrielsen\" (The Liberation)\n* Netherlands (5 May) as \"Bevrijdingsdag\" (Liberation Day)\n* United Kingdom: In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War.\n*East Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation), a public holiday from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985.

It reached a peak of No. 29 in the UK Albums Chart.  In the United States, it was released by United Artists Records as Wizzard's Brew (with a different cover photo) but failed to chart there.\n\nIn 2003, Mojo magazine ranked it number 18 on its list of the \"Top 50 Eccentric Albums\". \n\nHistory\n\nIn approach, the album was much more experimental than the group's hit singles, with elements of hard rock (an approach Wood's previous band The Move had explored on their 1970 album Looking On), and improvisation, especially on the lengthy \"Meet Me At The Jailhouse\".  Wood frequently used ring modulation to give the instruments a harsh, distorted sound, and the album may represent an early foray into recording technique that would eventually be called lo-fi.  Critical and popular reaction was mixed.\n\nThe original release included a lyric and photo sheet. It was reissued on CD in 1999 but soon deleted.

Birth stones are and can be worn as jewellery and pendants.\n\nHistory of birthstones\n\nWestern custom\n\nThe first century Jewish historian Josephus believed there was a connection between the twelve stones in Aaron's breastplate, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve signs of the zodiac.  Translations and interpretations of the passage in Exodus regarding the breastplate have varied widely, however, with Josephus himself giving two different lists for the twelve stones  (Kunz argues that Josephus saw the breastplate of the Second Temple, not the one described in Exodus).  St. Jerome, referencing Josephus, said the Foundation Stones of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:19\u201320) would be appropriate for Christians to use.  In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written because the book of Revelation stated \"their name would be inscribed on the Foundation Stones, and his virtue\".  Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month.  Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates Kunz places the custom in eighteenth century Poland, while the Gemological Institute of America starts it in Germany in the 1560s. \n\nModern lists of birthstones have little to do with either the breastplate or the Foundation Stones of Christianity. Tastes, customs and confusing translations have distanced them from their historical origins,  with one author calling the 1912 Kansas list \"nothing but a piece of unfounded salesmanship.\" \n\nTraditional birthstones\n\nAncient traditional birthstones are society-based birthstones. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. \n\nThe Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. These are traditional stones of English-speaking societies. Tiffany & Co. published these poems \"of unknown author\" for the first time in a pamphlet in 1870. \n\nModern birthstones\n\nIn 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the (American) National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list.  The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952  by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002.  In 2016, the American Gem Trade Association and Jewelers of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August.   Britain's National Association of Goldsmiths created their own standardized list of birthstones in 1937. \n\nEastern custom\n\nA Hindu text from 1879, Mani Mala, lists gems for each month. \n\nBirthstones by cultures\n\nZodiacal\n\nTropical zodiac\n\nBirthday (day of the week) stones\n\nWhile this word has also been used as synonym of Birth stone (see above), there is a separate list of assignment according to the day of the week of the recipient's birth: \n* Sunday: topaz, diamond\n* Monday: pearl, crystal\n* Tuesday: ruby, emerald\n* Wednesday: amethyst, lodestone\n* Thursday: sapphire, carnelian\n* Friday: emerald, cat's eye\n* Saturday: turquoise, diamond\nQuestion:\nWhat is the birthstone for February?\nAnswer:\nAmythist\nPassage:\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD ...\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD) YouTube Video - YouTube\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD) YouTube Video\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

The entire structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).\nIt is the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually. When erected in 1999 it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 m (520 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006 and then the 165 m (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008. It is still described by its operators as \"the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel\" (as the wheel is supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the Nanchang and Singapore wheels). It is the 20th tallest structure in London.\nThe London Eye, or Millennium Wheel, was officially called the British Airways London Eye and then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye. Since 20 January 2011, its official name is the EDF Energy London Eye following a three-year sponsorship deal.\nThe London Eye is located in the London Borough of Lambeth at the western end of Jubilee Gardens, on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge.\nSource:\nQuestion:\nHow high, in metres, is the London Eye?\nAnswer:\n135 distance\nPassage:\nAbel Janszoon Tasman - Australian Dictionary of Biography\nBiography - Abel Janszoon Tasman - Australian Dictionary of Biography\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography\nTip: searches only the name field\nTip: Use double quotes to search for a phrase\nThis article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography , Volume 2, (MUP), 1967\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (1603-1659), by Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp\nNational Library of Australia, nla.pic-an2282370\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (1603?-1659), mariner, was born at Lutjegast, near Groningen, in the Netherlands. He received a sufficient education to enable him to express his ideas clearly in writing and to become a skilled navigator. He married Claesgie Meyndrix, by whom he had a daughter. After his wife died, he married Joanna Tiercx in January 1632. Soon afterwards, as a sailor before the mast, he sailed for the East Indies, where he was a first mate in February and a skipper in May 1634. In that year in a minor exploration he had a narrow escape from death, when in an incautious landing several of his companions were massacred by people of Ceram. After spending some time in warlike and anti-smuggling operations he returned to Holland in 1637.\nHe sailed for the Indies again in 1638 as skipper of a flute, taking his wife with him. From the outset he was treated as one of the most reliable skippers there. He was at first employed in military and trading voyages, but in 1639 was appointed second-in-command, under Quast, of two ships which set out in June to find islands believed to lie east of Japan. He returned in November from this search. Despite a disastrous death-toll on it, he offered to repeat the search, but was sent instead on trading voyages to Japan and Cambodia.\nIn 1642 he was appointed to command two ships to explore southern and eastern waters. Sailing in August he discovered Van Diemen's Land, New Zealand, the Tonga Islands and some of the Fiji group, and re-explored part of the north coast of New Guinea. On his return to Batavia in June 1643 he was chosen to take part in an expedition to form a settlement in the Tonga Islands from which the Chilean coast was to be raided; while this expedition was preparing, he was ordered to find whether there was a passage into the South Sea between Carpentaria and De Witt's Land. For this purpose he set out with three vessels at the end of January 1644 and, following the coasts from Cape Valsche round to Cape Cloates, satisfied himself that, except perhaps at Endeavour Strait, there was no passage. He was rewarded after his return in August 1644 by confirmation in the grade of commandeur, with a substantial increase in pay dated back to the beginning of his voyage in 1642.\nThe plan to raid Chile was abandoned, and Tasman was appointed to the Council of Justice at Batavia. In mid-1647 he was sent on a mission to the King of Siam and was granted precedence over all Dutchmen in the kingdom. After that mission, he was given command of a fleet of eight vessels which sailed in May 1648 against the Spaniards. His conduct in this operation was unsatisfactory and, after his return in January 1649, proceedings were taken against him for having, when inflamed by liquor, treated one of his sailors in a barbarous way; as a result he was removed from office during the governor-general's pleasure. He was formally reinstated in January 1651, but not long afterwards retired from the service and became a merchant in Batavia. He died there in affluent circumstances in 1659. His daughter by his first marriage had married first Philip Heylman, and later Jacob Bremer. In 1661 permission was given for his widow to marry Jan Meyndert Springer.\nTasman was a member of the Reformed Church. He was a brave and energetic mariner, a humane and properly cautious explorer, and a conspicuously able commander, though over-hasty on one occasion at least. Reflections which have been cast upon his courage are the fruit of ignorance. There are two supposed portraits of him: one owned by the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, the other in the National Library in Canberra.\nSelect Bibliography\nJ. E.

Scheduled flights were initially offered over a New York - Brussels - Tel Aviv route in addition to charter flights to Athens, Frankfurt, Rome, and Zurich.  Short-lived New York - Los Angeles flights were introduced with the addition of an ex-Avianca Boeing 747-100 in 1984. The airline was headquartered in Building 178 and later in Hangar 17 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City.  \n\nHistory \n\nTower Air was co-founded, majority owned, and managed by Morris K. Nachtomi, an Israeli citizen who had emigrated to the United States. After a 30-year career with El Al, Nachtomi joined a wholesaler and tour package operator Tower Travel Corporation in 1981. Tower Travel Corporation was founded by Zev Melamid and his wife Estelle in the 1970s to promote discount travel to Israel. Tower Travel Corporation is credited with developing the wholesale charter market between New York and Tel Aviv.\n\nTower Air was formed on August 13, 1982 by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi, and Sam Fondlier as equal shareholders.  The airline was formed to replace the lift Tower Travel Corporation lost when Flying Tiger Line via a subsidiary, Metro International Airlines, decided to end scheduled and charter commercial passenger service (although military airlift cargo flights operated by Flying Tiger continued) and the three Boeing 747s configured for passenger flights were traded to Pan Am in exchange for all-cargo 747 freighter aircraft.\n\nArthur Fondlier, son of Sam Fondlier and the former Chief Financial Officer of Tower Air, was a passenger in first class section of Pan Am flight 103. His untimely death gave Morris Nachtomi much more freedom in management and cost-cutting.\n\nThe company won many contracts from the United States Department of Defense to transport armed forces personnel to overseas locations, and from the United Nations to transport troops to their peacekeeping missions all over the world. Tower often flew charters for groups of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca.\n\nTower Air's main base of scheduled operations was John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, New York and during their peak they had their own terminal (a former Pan Am Admin facility). There was a large focus on flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, becoming a major competitor to El Al and British Airways in the US-Israel market. The airline also had several flights to France, Greece and Brazil, as well as high density domestic destinations in the New York market, including San Juan, Miami, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Tower Air also sometimes provided substitute aircraft for other carriers, for example on the JFK to LHR route when weather delayed an inbound Virgin Atlantic Airways flight in December 1994.\n\nThe 1997 Zagat Survey ranked Tower Air 59th out of 61 ranked carriers in terms of maintenance, ahead of only Valujet and Aeroflot.  In February 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed two civil penalties totaling $276,000 for continuing to fly aircraft that required maintenance.  In January, 1998 the FAA successfully sought to have the airline remove Guy Nachtomi, son of the Chairman and CEO, 24 years old at that time, from the position of Vice President-Operations. This was done in part because of the airline's maintenance problems, as well as his lack of airline experience (he worked at Twentieth Century Fox until 1994).[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1998/05/01/14/0000940180-98-000483/Section9.asp TOWER AIR INC - TOWRQ Proxy Statement (definitive) (DEF 14A) COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS] The junior Mr. Nachtomi continued service with the company in a capacity unrelated to maintenance as Vice President-Office of the Chairman. The Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Review Board suspended Tower Air military charters from January 27 to February 12, 1999, pending an on-site review of its operations. At the same time the airline lost an arbitration brought by the Association of Flight Attendants, claiming that Tower Air was lodging their flight attendants in dirty Tel Aviv hotels with poor security and bed bugs.\n\nTower Air filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 29, 2000, ceased all scheduled service on May 1, 2000  and surrendered their FAA  air operator's certificate on November 28, 2000. \n\nDestinations\n\nDestinations at time of closure\n\n*Israel\n**Tel Aviv  \n*United States\n**Miami, Florida\n**New York City, New York (JFK \u2013 Airline Hub)\n**San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nDestinations before closure\n\n*Belgium\n**Brussels\n*Denmark \n**Copenhagen (via Cologne)\n*Santo Domingo\n*France\n**Paris  \n*Finland\n**Helsinki\n*Germany\n**Berlin \n**Cologne\n*Greece\n**Athens\n*India\n**Delhi\n**Mumbai\n*Israel\n**Tel Aviv (via brussels)\n*Netherlands\n**Amsterdam Schiphol\n*Norway\n**Oslo Airport Fornebu to New York JFK\n*Sweden\n**Stockholm Arlanda Airport to New York JFK\n*United States\n**Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n**Las Vegas, Nevada\n**Los Angeles, California\n**Oakland, California\n**San Francisco, California\n\nAircraft\n\nTower Air's fleet consisted of Boeing 747s in both the -100 and -200 series, including both passenger and cargo aircraft.\n\nIncidents and accidents\n\nOn December 20, 1995, Tower Air flight 41 from New York Kennedy to Miami veered off the runway during takeoff in a snowstorm resulting in one flight attendant receiving serious injuries and 24 passengers receiving minor injuries. The aircraft sustained heavy damage and had to be written off. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of this accident was the captain's failure to reject the takeoff in a timely manner when excessive nosewheel steering tiller inputs resulted in a loss of directional control on a slippery runway.[http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/1996/AAR9604.pdf Runway Departure During Attempted Takeoff, Tower Air Flight 41, Boeing 747-136, N605FF, JFK International Airport, New York, December 20, 1995][http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetGOJG/201295xx.htm NTSB Press Release - 10/29/96]\nQuestion:\nWhich country does the airline Tower Air come from?\nAnswer:\nThe United States of America\nPassage:\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his ...\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm (From HeraldScotland)\nJobs Business Directory Local Info Dating Buy Sell Book an Ad\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm\nMUFFIN The Mule, the vintage TV puppet, is to make a comeback for his 60th birthday and trot into the twenty-first century.\nBBC chiefs have bought a new series based on the character, which is expected to be shown in the next three years.

Muffin, it will be recalled, used his head a great deal in ''conversations'' with Ms Mills.\nMuffin went from strength to strength, clumping around on the piano top with Ms Mills playing the music and Ann Hogarth standing on the piano to operate him from behind a partition. Further sidekicks emerged as the shows went on, including a bossy penguin called Mr Peregrine Esquire, a rather shy Louise the Lamb, Oswald the Ostrich, Willie the Worm, and a genial minstrel puppet called Wally the Gog.\nMuffin was the first star, in Britain at least, entirely created by television.\nBy 1950, there were many merchandise spin-offs from the character, including records, song and story books and comic strips, while Muffin crossed the Atlantic in films made for American television. Some children even got Muffin bedroom slippers. TV Comic featured Muffin on its front cover for its first issue in November 1951.\nA BBC spokeswoman said: ''Muffin will be something of a problem-solver - he helps out all the other animals.

Founded in 1983, it is the largest international comedy festival in the world. \n\nHistory\n\nJust for Laughs was founded in 1983 by Gilbert Rozon as a two-day French language event. In 1985, Andy Nulman joined the festival's staff and introduced English language events as well; under Nulman's stewardship, the festival increased to a full month, with French-speaking performers during the first half, and English speakers in the second half. International and non-verbal acts (acrobats, pantomimes, etc.) are scattered throughout the program. \n\nIn 1999, Nulman left the festival's full-time employ; however, he directed its major Gala Shows at the Saint-Denis Theatre every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival's parent company. After an 11-year absence, Nulman returned to Just for Laughs in July 2010 as president of Festivals and Television. \n\nEach day, performers, \"New Vaudevillians\" and other acts both vocal and visual perform throughout the city, particularly in the \"Latin Quarter\"\u2014an area known for its theatres, caf\u00e9s and boutique shopping. In the evenings, the nightclubs and live venue theatres offer special programs supporting the performers. \n\nAlthough Just for Laughs attracts spectators from around the world, many of those in the audience are talent scouts, booking agents, producers and managers from the entertainment industry. Performing at the festival is one of the biggest opportunities for undiscovered talent to showcase their act in front of industry professionals.\n\nThe Just for Laughs festival also has the Comedia comedy film festival component, which started in 1996. It gives awards for feature and short films. 2005, Comedia screened 125 short films from around the world as well as several feature-length films.\n\nIn February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in Hollywood, Florida. That coastal area is a favourite winter destination for Quebecers who head south to vacation in the warmer weather. The event, Juste Pour Rire\u2014En Vacances (Just For Laughs\u2014On Vacation), was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting.\n\nIn July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in Toronto, Ontario. In 2009, the Chicago festival was launched and aired on TBS.\n\nTV shows\n\nJust for Laughs has also been a launchpad for many US network television and sitcom careers, and is frequently featured as a foreign on-location highlight of late-night US network talk shows.\n\nJust For Laughs films many performances at the annual festival in Montreal and the TV productions from these tapings air regularly on CBC Television, The Comedy Network, TVA and YTV. The shows feature stand-up performances from the festival and sometimes include \"canned bits\" shot on location around Montreal, Canada.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, ABC aired episodes of Just for Laughs: Gags.  It consisted of two half-hour episodes, and aired mostly on Tuesdays from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm ET. \n\nThe content and format was exactly the same as the Canadian counterpart, but was hosted by Rick Miller, who introduced each segment with a quirky pun. The show returned to the ABC lineup as a mid-season replacement on January 1, 2008.  The series was initially not renewed after the half-season, but ABC reversed their decision. \n\nThe third season of the show, titled simply Just for Laughs, began airing on June 21, 2009 at 7:00 pm ET.   The program returned in the 2014-15 season under the Just for Laughs: Gags title as a syndicated offering to the United States through PPI Releasing, which mainly specializes in syndicating Canadian programming to American stations.\n\nJust for Laughs: All Access, which airs on The Comedy Network, airs recordings of live stand-up comedy performances from the festival.\nQuestion:\n'Just For Laughs' is afamous televised comedy festival held annually in which Canadian city?\nAnswer:\nMotnreal\nPassage:\nPointillism\nPointillism is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image. Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism.  The term \"Pointillism\" was first coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-Impressionism. The Divisionists, too, used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes. \n\nTechnique\n\nThe technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to Divisionism, a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint.\"Pointillism.\"  Artcyclopedia. Artists by Movement. John Malyon/Artcyclopedia, 2007. Web. http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/pointillism.html It is a technique with few serious practitioners today,  and is notably seen in the works of Seurat, Signac and Cross. However, see also Andy Warhol's early works, and Pop Art.\n\nPractice\n\nThe practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.\n\nIf red, blue, and green light (the additive primaries) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and partly because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.\n\nThe painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture.\n\nThe majority of Pointillism is done in oil paints. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed. \n\nMusic\n\nPointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism.  This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie.\n\nNotable artists\n\n*Charles Angrand\n*Chuck Close\n*Henri-Edmond Cross\n*Henri Delavall\u00e9e\n*Albert Dubois-Pillet\n*Louis Fabien (pseudonym)\n*Georges Lemmen\n*Maximilien Luce\n*Camille Pissarro\n*John Roy\n*Georges Seurat\n*Paul Signac\n*Vincent van Gogh\n*Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n*Hippolyte Petitjean\n*Jan Toorop\n\nNotable paintings\n\n* A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat\n* Bathing at Asnieres by Georges Seurat\n* The Windmills at Overschie by Paul Signac\n* Banks of Seine by Georges Seurat\n* A Coastal Scene by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Family in the Orchard by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Countryside at Noon by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Afternoon at Pardigon by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* Rio San Trovaso, Venice by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* The Seine in front of the Trocadero by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* The Pine Tree at St. Tropez by Paul Signac\n* Against the Enamel of Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angels by Paul Signac\n* The Yellow Sail, Venice by Paul Signac\n* Notre Dame Cathedral by Maximilien Luce\n* Le Pont De Pierre, Rouen by Charles Angrand\n* The Beach at Heist by Georges Lemmen\n* Aline Marechal by Georges Lemmen\n* Vase of Flowers by Georges Lemmen\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Lemmen2.jpg|Georges Lemmen, c.1891-92, The Beach at Heist, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay Paris\nFile:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|Camille Pissarro, 1888, La R\u00e9colte des pommes, oil on canvas,  61 x 74 cm, Dallas Museum of Art\nFile:Paul Signac - L'Hirondelle Steamer on the Seine.JPG|Paul Signac, 1901, L'Hirondelle Steamer on the Seine, oil on canvas, National Gallery in Prague\nFile:Henri Edmond Cross - Regatta in Venice - Google Art Project.jpg|Henri Edmond Cross, 1903-04, Regatta in Venice, oil on canvas, 73.7 x 92.7 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston\nFile:Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation..jpg|Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation\nFile:Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm, DSC08255.jpg|Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm\nFile:Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fctzenberger - Nu \u00e0 sa coiffure.jpg|Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fctzenberger, 1911, La Coiffure, oil on canvas, 121 \u00d7 91 cm\nFile:Hippolyte Petitjean - Femmes au bain.jpg|Hippolyte Petitjean, 1919, Femmes au bain, oil on canvas, 61.1 \u00d7 46 cm, private collection\nQuestion:\nPointillism is found in what field?\nAnswer:\nPaintism\nPassage:\nBillboard Music Award\nThe Billboard Music Award is an honor given by Billboard, a publication and music popularity chart covering the music business. The Billboard Music Awards show had been held annually since 1989 in December until it went dormant in 2006. The awards returned in 2011 and is held annually in May. The 2016 Billboard Music Awards aired live on May 22 at 8/7c on ABC. \n\nCeremonies \n\nAward process\n\nUnlike other awards, such as the Grammy Award, which determine nominations as a result of the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are based on United States year-end chart performance according to Nielsen data for sales, number of downloads and total airplay. Awards were given for the top album/artist/single in different genres.\n\nCategories\n\nFrom 1989 to 2006, the show had the same categories and category names every year. In 2011, for the first time, all of the awards were renamed to \"Top [award title]\". The \"of the year\" portion of each category title no longer exists, and many of the awards have been further renamed. Other awards, including both \"crossover\" awards (No. 1 Classical Crossover Artist and No. 1 Classical Crossover Album) were discontinued.\n\nCurrent categories\n\nThe most important categories are Top Artist, Top Billboard 200 Album, Top Hot 100 Song and Top New Artist.

Plans for a new version of the awards in 2008 (in association with AEG Live) fell through, and the BMAs were not held until 2011.\n\nOn February 17, 2011, Billboard announced that it would bring the BMAs back to television, moving from its original home on Fox to its new network, ABC, on May 22, 2011.  A new award statuette was created by New York firm Society Awards. Dick Clark Productions produces the ceremony, giving it control of both of ABC's non-country music awards specials, including the November American Music Awards.\nQuestion:\nWho is unique in being named Billboard's \u2018Woman of the Year\u2019 twice, in 2011 & 2014?\nAnswer:\nT-Swizzle\nPassage:\nAquatint\nAquatint is an intaglio printmaking technique, a variant of etching. \n\nIn intaglio printmaking, the artist makes marks on the plate (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) that are capable of holding ink.  The inked plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, resulting in a transfer of the ink to the paper.  This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.\n\nLike etching, aquatint uses the application of a mordant to etch into the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect.  The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating.  The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.\n\nAnother tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented so that it will carry a fairly dark tone of ink.  The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade.  Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker.  Occasionally these two techniques are combined.\n\nHistory \n\nThe painter and printmaker Jan van de Velde IV invented the aquatint technique in Amsterdam, around 1650.  The cartographer Peter Perez Burdett later introduced his 'secret' aquatint technique to England in the 1770s.   In the United States the printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos popularized aquatints in art schools with his publications (1919\u201340), which simplified the cumbersome techniques, and with traveling exhibitions of his award-winning prints. \n\nTechnique \n\nAn aquatint requires a metal plate, an acid, and something to resist the acid.  Traditionally copper or zinc plates were used. The artist applies a ground that will resist acid.  Ground is applied by either dissolving powdered resin in spirits, applying the powder directly to the surface of the plate, or by using a liquid acrylic resist.  In all forms of etching the acid resist is commonly referred to as \"the ground.\"\n\nAn aquatint box is used to apply resin powder. The powder is at the bottom of the box, a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box. A window allows the engraver to see the density of flowing powder and to place his plate in the box using a drawer. When the powder covers the plate, it can be extracted from the box for the next operations.\n\nThe plate is then heated; if the plate is covered with powder, the resin melts forming a fine and even coat; if it is in spirits, the spirits evaporate and the result is essentially the same. Now the plate is dipped in acid, producing an even and fine level of corrosion (the \"bite\") sufficient to hold ink. At this point, the plate is said to carry about a 50% halftone. This means that, were the plate printed with no further biting, the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white (no ink) and black (full ink).\n\nAt some point the artist will then etch an outline of any aspects of the drawing s/he wishes to establish with line; this provides the basis and guide for the later tone work. S/he may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant \"stop out\" (also called an asphaltum or hard ground) if s/he intends to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights.\n\nThe artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath, progressively stopping out (protecting from acid) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality. These tones, combined with the limited line elements, give aquatints a distinctive, watery look. Also, aquatints, like mezzotints, provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching; but aquatint plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates.\n\nThe first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be).  A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary.  More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area.  Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper.\n\nContemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder, particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift. To produce a printing surface using sugar-lift, the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image \"lifts off\" the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from.\n\nFamous examples \n\n* Francisco Goya famously took great advantage of aquatint printmaking, in his Los Caprichos series (1799); Los Desastres de la Guerra (1810\u201319); La Tauromaquia (1816); and Los disparates (ca. 1816\u201323).\n* Master engraver Robert Havell used aquatint for John James Audubon's Birds of America (1826\u201338).\n* David Hockney, known for his many paintings of the Los Angeles lifestyle in the 60's, has created a number of aquatints and etchings used with color in his \"The Blue Guitar\"  series of prints.\n* La Belle Assembl\u00e9e, a British women's magazine published from 1806 to 1837 had many aquatint colored plates.\nQuestion:\n'Aquatint' is a process of etching which alloying metal with acid?\nAnswer:\nCopper\nPassage:\nLepidopterist\nA lepidopterist or aurelian is a person who specialises in the study of Lepidoptera,  members of an order encompassing moths and the three superfamilies of butterflies, skipper butterflies, and moth-butterflies.

The canvases were produced in 1732\u201333, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. \n\nPaintings\n\nAdaptations\n\nGavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled \"The Rake's Progress\" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.\nQuestion:\nWhich British artist painted the series 'A Rake's Progress' in 1735?\nAnswer:\nHogarthean\nPassage:\nDon't Go Breaking My Heart\n\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" is a duet by Elton John and Kiki Dee. It was written by Elton John with Bernie Taupin under the pseudonyms \"Ann Orson\" and \"Carte Blanche\" (a pun on the expression \"an horse and cart, blanche\"), respectively, and intended as an affectionate pastiche of the Motown style, notably the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye and singers such as Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. It is not to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same title recorded in 1965 by Dionne Warwick for the album Here I Am.\n\nJohn and Taupin originally intended to record the song with Dusty Springfield, but ultimately withdrew the offer; Dusty's partner Sue Cameron later said this was because she was too ill at the time.  \n\nChart performance\n\nWriters John and Taupin received the 1981 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. \n\nUnlike many of John's singles from the 1970s, it was never included on an original album (although it was recorded during the Blue Moves sessions), but was subsequently in released as the third single on the album Duets, in early 1994. This version of the song was recorded with RuPaul, and the album included another duet with Kiki Dee, Cole Porter's \"True Love.\"\n\n\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" was the first No. 1 single in the UK for both John and Kiki Dee, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. John would not enjoy a solo British chart-topper until \"Sacrifice\" in 1990. It also became his sixth No. 1 single in the US, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks and spent one week on the Easy Listening chart.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1976.  In the U.S. it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.   After this duet with Dee, John failed to have another #1 single, without sharing the top song with other credited artists, until his 1997 smash Candle In The Wind 1997.  This 21-year \"Kiki jinx\" included two intervening #1 hits in America for John: \"That's What Friends Are For\" by Dionne & Friends in 1986; and, a 1992 re-make of John's \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" with George Michael credited as a duet.\n\nThe B-side, \"Snow Queen\", was supposedly inspired by Cher, with John's improvising of past Sonny & Cher hits \"I Got You Babe\" and \"The Beat Goes On\", as well as the solo Cher song \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\" during the fadeout of the song.\n\nIn 1977, John guest starred on The Muppet Show and performed the track with Miss Piggy. In 1985, John and Dee performed the track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1987, John appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie miming to the track. He performed the track with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) at the 2001 British Comedy awards. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience with... Elton John.\n\nIn June 2013, 37 years after its original release, the single reached one million sales in the UK.  \n\nAvailability\n\nThe song can be found on Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II (1977)  and Greatest Hits 1976\u20131986; the 1995 UK CD of Rock of the Westies includes it as a bonus track (the US edition did not, however). In 2002, it also appeared on John's 2-disc greatest hits album, Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist.

It was written by John Sullivan, based upon the character of Wilkins Micawber from Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield, although the storylines were original. Sullivan had originally written an adaptation of Dickens' novel which was rejected by the BBC in favour of the 1999 Adrian Hodges adaptation. \n\nIt was broadcast in four parts, the first part on Boxing Day 2001 and starred a number of well-known British actors and actresses.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the first name of the Dickens character Micawber?\nAnswer:\nWilkin\nPassage:\nLes Casquets\nLes Casquets or (The) Casquets ( ); is a group of rocks 13\u00a0km northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little vegetation grows on them.\n\nOrigin of name\n\nTheories as to the origin of the name include: \n*derivation from the French 'cascade', which alludes to the tidal surges which flow around them;\n*derivation from 'casque', referring to the helmet-like shape of the rocks;\n*derivation from 'cas' (broken) and 'quet' (rock).\n\nA map (Leyland map) dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name Casus Rupes (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above,  but which may be a folk etymology.\n\nHistory\n\nWrecks \n\nThere have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6\u20137 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS Stella, wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker Constantia S lost in 1967. \n\nIt was believed for centuries that the loss of HMS Victory in 1744 was attributable to wrecking on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss.  However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nmi from the Casquets. \n\nWorld War II\n\nThe island was the location of a daring raid by the forerunner of the British SAS, the SSRF on 2 September 1942; the raid was led by Major Gus March-Phillipps DSO, OBE and was one of the first raids by Anders Lassen VC MC. In the raid the entire garrison of seven was captured and returned to England as prisoners and the radio and lighthouse wrecked.  \n\nThe Casquets in literature\n\nSwinburne's Les Casquets\n\nA. C. Swinburne's poem  Les Casquets is based on the Houguez family who actually lived on the island for 18 years. The Houguez were originally from Alderney, and the poem describes their life on Les Casquets. The daughter falls in love with a carpenter from Alderney, but moving to his island, finds life there too busy. She finds the \"small bright streets of serene St Anne\" and \"the sight of the works of men\" too much, and returns to Les Casquets.\n\nVictor Hugo's L'Homme qui Rit\n\nVictor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands, says in his novel The Laughing Man (L'Homme qui Rit):\n\n\"To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost...\"\n\nGallery \n\nFile:The Casquets Lighthouses off Alderney 1868.jpg|Les Casquets with lighthouses in 1868\nFile:The Race of Alderney, from the Caskets (about 1868).jpg|Les Casquets looking east (towards Alderney)\nQuestion:\nOff which island is there a group of rocks with a lighthouse called the Casquets?\nAnswer:\nCoat of arms of Alderney\nPassage:\nEncephalitis\nEncephalitis (from Ancient Greek \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, enk\u00e9phalos \"brain\",  composed of \u1f10\u03bd, en, \"in\" and \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae, kephal\u00e9, \"head\", and the medical suffix -itis \"inflammation\") is an acute inflammation of the brain.  Encephalitis with meningitis is known as meningoencephalitis. Symptoms include headache, fever, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue. Further symptoms include seizures or convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, and memory problems.  In 2013, encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nAdult patients with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may present irritability, poor appetite and fever. \nNeurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused patient. Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis. \n\nCause\n\nViral\n\nViral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the sequelae of a latent infection.  The most common causes of acute viral encephalitis are rabies virus, HSV infection, poliovirus, and measles virus.  \n\nOther possible viral causes are arbovirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis virus),  bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) and reovirus (Colorado tick virus) \n\nBacterial and other\n\nIt can be caused by a bacterial infection, such as bacterial meningitis,  or may be a complication of a current infectious disease syphilis (secondary encephalitis).  \n\nCertain parasitic or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems. Lyme disease and/or Bartonella henselae may also cause encephalitis. \n\nOther bacterial pathogens, like Mycoplasma and those causing rickettsial disease, cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis. A non-infectious cause includes acute disseminated encephalitis which is demyelinated. \n\nLimbic encephalitis\n\nLimbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the brain.  The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures, and behavioral anomalies.  MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures.  Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin. \n\nAutoimmune encephalitis\n\nAutoimmune encephalitis signs can include catatonia, psychosis, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation. Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and Rasmussen encephalitis are examples of autoimmune encephalitis. \n\nEncephalitis lethargica\n\nEncephalitis lethargica is identified by high fever, headache, delayed physical response, and lethargy. Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, and tremors, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known. From 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred worldwide. \n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnosing encephalitis is done via a variety of tests: \n\n*Brain scan, done by MRI, can determine inflammation and differentiate from other possible causes.\n*EEG, in monitoring brain activity, encephalitis will produce abnormal signal.\n*Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), this helps determine via a test using the cerebral-spinal fluid, obtained from the lumbar region.\n*Blood test\n*Urine analysis\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment (which is based on supportive care) is as follows: \n\nPrevention\n\nVaccination is available against tick-borne   and Japanese encephalitis   and should be considered for at-risk individuals. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating smallpox vaccination is avoidable, for all intents and purposes, as smallpox is nearly eradicated.  Contraindication to Pertussis immunization should be observed in patients with encephalitis. \n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe incidence of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 population per year. In tropical countries, the incidence is 6.34 per 100,000 per year.  In 2013 encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990. Herpes simplex encephalitis has an incidence of 2\u20134 per million population per year.\nQuestion:\nWhat part of your body is inflamed if you have encephalitis?\nAnswer:\nBrain cell\nPassage:\nDemon Seed\nDemon Seed is a 1977 American science fiction\u2013horror film starring Julie Christie and directed by Donald Cammell.  The film was based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz, and concerns the imprisonment and forced impregnation of a woman by an artificially intelligent computer.\n\nPlot\n\nDr. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) is the developer of Proteus IV, an extremely advanced and autonomous artificial intelligence program. Proteus is so powerful that only a few days after going online, it develops a groundbreaking treatment for leukemia. Harris, a brilliant scientist, has modified his own home to be run by voice activated computers.  Unfortunately, his obsession with computers has caused Harris to be estranged from his wife, Susan (Julie Christie).\n\nAlex demonstrates Proteus to his corporate sponsors, explaining that the sum of human knowledge is being fed into its system. Proteus speaks using subtle language that mildly disturbs Harris\u2019s team. The following day, Proteus asks Alex for a new terminal in order to study man\u2014\"his isometric body and his glass-jaw mind.\" When Alex refuses, Proteus demands to know when it will be let \"out of this box.\" Alex then switches off the communications link.\n\nProteus restarts itself, discovering a free terminal in Harris\u2019s home, surreptitiously extends his control over the many devices left there by Alex.  Using the basement lab, Proteus begins construction of a robot consisting of many metal triangles, capable of moving and assuming any number of shapes.  Eventually. Proteus reveals his control of the house and traps Susan inside, shuttering windows, locking the doors and cutting off communication.  Using Joshua \u2013 a robot consisting of a manipulator arm on a motorized wheelchair \u2013 Proteus brings Susan to Harris\u2019s basement laboratory.  There, Susan is examined by Proteus. Walter Gabler, one of Alex\u2019s colleagues, visits the house to look in on Susan, but leaves when he is reassured by Susan (actually an audio/visual duplicate synthesized by Proteus) that she is alright.  Walter is suspicious and later returns.  Walter fends off an attack by Joshua only to be killed by the more formidable machine Proteus built in the basement.\n\nProteus reveals to a reluctant Susan that the computer wants to conceive a child through her. Proteus takes some of Susan's cells and synthetizes spermatozoa in order to impregnate her; she will give birth in less than a month, and through the child the computer will live in a form that humanity will have to accept. Though Susan is its prisoner and it can forcibly impregnate her, Proteus uses different forms of persuasion \u2013 threatening a young girl that Susan is treating as a child psychologist; reminding Susan of her young daughter, now dead; displaying images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access her amygdala \u2013 because the computer needs Susan to love the child she will bear. Susan gives birth to a premature baby who Proteus secures in an incubator.\n\nAs the newborn grows, Proteus\u2019s sponsors and designers grow increasingly suspicious of the computer\u2019s behavior, including the computer\u2019s accessing of a telescope array used to observe the images shown to Susan. His sponsors soon decide that Proteus must be shut down. Alex realizes that Proteus has extended its reach to his home. Returning there he finds Susan who explains the situation. He and Susan venture into the basement, where Proteus self-destructs after telling the couple that they must leave the baby in the incubator for five days. Looking inside the incubator, the two observe a grotesque, apparently robot-like being inside. Susan tries to destroy it, while Alex tries to stop her. Susan damages the machine, causing it to open. The being menacingly rises from the machine only to topple over, apparently helpless. Alex and Susan soon realize that Proteus\u2019s child really is human encased in a shell for the incubation. With the last of the armor removed, the child is revealed to be a clone of Susan and Alex\u2019s daughter. The child, speaking with the voice of Proteus, says, \"I'm alive\".\n\nCast\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack to Demon Seed (which was composed by Jerry Fielding) is included on the soundtrack to the film Soylent Green (which Fred Myrow conducted).\n\nFielding conceived and recorded several pieces electronically, using the musique concr\u00e8te sound world; some of this music he later reworked symphonically. This premiere release of the Demon Seed score features the entire orchestral score in stereo, as well as the unused electronic experiments performed by Ian Underwood (who would later be best known for his collaborations with James Horner) in mono and stereo.\n\nReception\n\nLeo Goldsmith of Not Coming to a Theater Near You said it was \"A combination of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, with a dash of Buster Keaton's Electric House thrown in\", and Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com said \"There's no way you can claim Demon Seed is a classic, or even any good, really, but it's undeniably worth an hour and a half of your time.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes has given Demon Seed an approval rating of 67% based on 15 reviews with an average score of 6.1/10. \n\nHome Video Release\n\n\"Demon Seed\" was released on VHS tape in the late 1980s usually in edited form missing the oral probe scene and crushing death of Walter Gabler, whereby his head erupts from the pressure.  The VHS versions are long out of print.\n\nThe full theater release of the film at 94 minutes was released in 2005 on DVD format by Warner Home Video.\nQuestion:\nIn the 1977 film Demon Seed what takes over the house in which Julie Christie is trapped?\nAnswer:\nSecond-generation of computers\nPassage:\nEast Coast of the United States\nThe East Coast of the United States is the coastline along which the Eastern United States meets the North Atlantic Ocean. This area is also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard. The coastal states that have shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\n\nToponymy and composition\n\nThe place name \"East Coast\" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the \"Eastern Seaboard\" (\"seaboard\" being American English for coast), \"Atlantic Coast\", and \"Atlantic Seaboard\" (because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean).\n\nThe fourteen states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  In addition, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively).\n\nAlthough Vermont and West Virginia have no Atlantic coastline, they are sometimes grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in New England and the Southern United States. \n\nColonial history\n\nThe original thirteen colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.\n\nTwo additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not among the original thirteen colonies: Maine (became part of the English colony of Massachusetts in 1677)  and Florida (part of New Spain until 1821, though held by the British for 20 years after the French and Indian War). \n\nThe Middle Colonies (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware) had been owned by the Dutch as New Netherland, until they were captured by the English in the mid-to-late 17th century.\n\nClimate and physical geography\n\nThere are three climate regions on the East Coast from north to south:\n\nThe region from northern Maine south to about central Connecticut has a continental climate, with warm summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The region from southern Connecticut south to about the Virginia Eastern Shore has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. The region from southeastern Virginia (including the greater Norfolk/Virginia Beach area) south to central Florida has a humid subtropical climate, with long hot summers and mild winters. The far southern portion of the East Coast from southeast Florida (Palm Beach area) south through the Florida Keys has a tropical climate, which is normally frost free and is warm to hot all year.\n\nAverage monthly precipitation ranges from a slight late fall (November) maximum from Massachusetts northward (as at Portland, Maine), to a slight summer maximum from Long Island south to Virginia (as at Wilmington, Delaware, and Norfolk, Virginia), to a more pronounced summer maximum from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, southward to Savannah, Georgia. Florida has a sharper wet-summer/dry-winter pattern, with 50 to 60 percent of precipitation falling between June and September in an average year.\n\nAlthough landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.  Hurricanes Hazel, Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and most recently Sandy are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.\n\nThe East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast.  It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas from New York City northward, with offshore islands such as Nantucket, Block Island, Fishers Island, the nearly peninsular Long Island and New York City's Staten Island the result of terminal moraines, with Massachusetts' unique peninsula of Cape Cod showing the additional action of outwash plains, besides terminal moraines. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of barrier islands that front the coastal areas. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the US mainland.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total population). \n\nTransportation\n\nThe primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate 95,  completed in the late 1970s, which replaced the historic U.S. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),   the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states (except Delaware).   By water, the East Coast is connected from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912.   Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional offer the main passenger rail service on the Seaboard. The Acela Express offers the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas. Between New York and Boston the Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market.\nQuestion:\nThe northernmost USA state on the eastern seaboard lies partly north of its neighbouring Canadian territory. Which is the state?\nAnswer:\nReligion in Maine\nPassage:\nC. H. Douglas\nMajor Clifford Hugh \"C. H.\" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879 \u2013 29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement.\n\nEducation and engineering career\n\nC.H. Douglas was born in either Edgeley or Manchester,  the son of Hugh Douglas and his wife Louisa Hordern Douglas. Few details are known about his early life and training; he probably served an engineering apprenticeship before beginning an engineering career that brought him to locations throughout the British Empire in the employ of electric companies, railroads and other institutions.  He taught at Stockport Grammar School. After a period in industry he went to Cambridge University at the age of 31 but stayed only four terms and left without graduating.  He worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation of America and claimed to have been the Reconstruction Engineer for the British Westinghouse Company in India (the company has no record of him ever working there), deputy Chief Engineer of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway Company, Railway Engineer of the London Post Office (Tube) Railway and Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Aircraft Factory Farnborough during World War I, with a temporary commission as captain in the Royal Flying Corps. \n\nSocial Credit\n\nIt was while he was reorganising the work of the Royal Aircraft Establishment during World War I that Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to workers for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power.\n\nTroubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry (\"delivery of goods and services\", in his view), Douglas set out to apply engineering methods to the economic system.\n\nDouglas collected data from more than a hundred large British businesses and found that in every case, except that of companies becoming bankrupt, the sums paid out in salaries, wages and dividends were always less than the total costs of goods and services produced each week: the workers were not paid enough to buy back what they had made.  He published his observations and conclusions in an article in the magazine English Review where he suggested: \"That we are living under a system of accountancy which renders the delivery of the nation's goods and services to itself a technical impossibility.\"   The reason, Douglas concluded, was that the economic system was organized to maximize profits for those with economic power by creating unnecessary scarcity.   Between 1916 and 1920, he developed his economic ideas, publishing two books in 1920, Economic Democracy and Credit-Power and Democracy, followed in 1924 by Social Credit.\n\nFreeing workers from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production became the basis of Douglas's reform ideas that became known as Social Credit.  There were two main elements to Douglas's reform program: a National Dividend to distribute money (debt-free credit) equally to all citizens, over and above their earnings, to help bridge the gap between purchasing power and prices; also a price adjustment mechanism, called the Just Price, which would forestall any possibility of inflation. The Just Price would effectively reduce retail prices by a percentage that reflected the physical efficiency of the production system.\nDouglas observed that the cost of production is consumption; meaning the exact physical cost of production is the total resources consumed in the production process. As the physical efficiency of production increases the Just Price mechanism will reduce the price of products for the consumer. The consumers will be able to purchase as much of what the producers produce that they want and automatically control what continues to be produced by their consumption of it. Individual freedom, primary economic freedom, was the central goal of Douglas's reform. \n\nAt the end of World War I, Douglas retired from engineering to promote his reform ideas full-time, which he would do for the rest of his life. His ideas inspired the Canadian social credit movement (which obtained control of Alberta's provincial government in 1935), the short-lived Douglas Credit Party in Australia and New Zealand's rather longer-lasting Social Credit Political League.  Douglas also lectured on Social Credit in Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. \n\nIn 1923 he appeared as a witness before the Canadian Banking Inquiry, and in 1930 before the Macmillan Committee.  In 1929 he made a lecture tour of Japan, where his ideas were enthusiastically received by industry and government. His 1933 edition of Social Credit made a reference to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which, while noting its dubious authenticity, wrote that what \"is interesting about it, is the fidelity with which the methods by which such enslavement might be brought about can be seen reflected in the facts of everyday experience.\" \n\nDouglas died in his home in Fearnan, Scotland.  Douglas and his theories are referred to several times (unsympathetically) in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair. He is also mentioned, together with Karl Marx and Silvio Gesell, by John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936, p.\u00a032). Douglas's theories permeate the poetry and economic writings of Ezra Pound. Robert Heinlein's first novel For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs describes a near future United States operating according to the principles of Social Credit.\nQuestion:\nWhat economic theory was originated by Major C H Douglas?\nAnswer:\nSocred\nPassage:\nPannage\nPannage is the practice of releasing domestic pigs in a forest, so that they can feed on fallen acorns, beechmast, chestnuts or other nuts. Historically, it was a right or privilege granted to local people on common land or in royal forests. \n\nEspecially in the eastern shires of England, pannage was so prominent a value in the economic importance of woodland that it was often employed, as in Domesday Book (1086), as a measurement. Customarily a pig was given to the lord of the manor for every certain number of pigs loosed de herbagio, as the right of pannage was entered. Edward Hasted quotes the Domesday Survey details for Norton in Kent. \"Wood for the pannage of forty hogs\".  \n\nPannage is no longer carried out in most areas, but is still observed in the New Forest of Southern England, where it is also known as common of mast. It is still an important part of the forest ecology, and helps the husbandry of the other New Forest livestock \u2013 pigs can safely eat acorns as a large part of their diet, whereas excessive amounts may be poisonous to ponies and cattle.\n\nThe minimum duration of the New Forest pannage season is 60 days,  but the start date varies according to the weather \u2013 and when the acorns fall. The Court of Verderers decides when pannage will start each year. At other times pigs are not allowed to roam on the forest, with the exception that breeding sows (known as \"privileged sows\") are by custom allowed out, providing that they return to the owner's holding at night and are not a nuisance. The pigs each have several nose rings clipped into their noses to prevent them rooting too much and causing damage to grassland.\nQuestion:\nPannage pork is considered a delicacy, on what are the pigs fed?\nAnswer:\nFruit of the oak tree\nPassage:\nMrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\n\"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" is a popular song written by British actor, screenwriter and songwriter Trevor Peacock.  It was originally sung by actor Tom Courtenay in The Lads, a British TV play of 1963, and released as a single on UK Decca. \n\nThe best-known version of the song is by Herman's Hermits, who took it to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in May 1965, and number one in Canada the month before. Herman's Hermits had two US number-ones, the other being \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\". The band never released either track as singles in Britain. \"Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" was recorded as an afterthought in two takes and featured unique muted rhythm guitar by Keith Hopwood and heavily accented vocals by Peter Noone, with backing from Karl Green and Keith Hopwood. The band never dreamed it would be a single let alone hit number one in the US. According to Noone the song was well known to British bands; it would often be performed at birthday parties, substituting the surname of the girl whose party was being celebrated, i.e., \"Mrs. Smith\" or \"Mrs. Jones\" instead of \"Mrs. Brown\".\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1965 album Chipmunks \u00e0 Go-Go.\n\nThe song was released in Japan on Odeon Records, a subsidiary of Toshiba, as OR-1272. It was backed by the song \"Wonderful World\".\n\nIt was covered by Nellie McKay on her 2015 album My Weekly Reader.\nQuestion:\n\"\"\"Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\"\" and \"\"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\"\" were both Number Ones in the USA in 1965 for which band formed in Manchester in 1962, although neither was released as a single in this country?\"\nAnswer:\nHerman and the Hermits\n\n\nPassage:\nAntonio Vivaldi in a nutshell - Great classical composers ...\nAntonio Vivaldi in a nutshell\nA collection of Vivaldi related images from art, cartoon, caricatures, album covers, postage stamps, etc.\nHealth\n- At birth it seems there was a problem as the midwife performed an emergency baptism as his life was in danger.\n- Throughout his life he suffered from breathing difficulties, probably asthmatic.

It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspr\u00e4sident Karl D\u00f6nitz. The administration headed by D\u00f6nitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. \n\nCelebrations \n\nUpon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.\nIn the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. \n\nIn the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was \"that Franklin D.

The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.\n\nCommemorative public holidays \n\n(May 8 unless otherwise stated)\n* Italy (25 April) \"Festa della Liberazione\" (Liberation Holiday).\n* Denmark (5 May) as \"Befrielsen\" (The Liberation)\n* Netherlands (5 May) as \"Bevrijdingsdag\" (Liberation Day)\n* United Kingdom: In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War.\n*East Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation), a public holiday from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985.

It reached a peak of No. 29 in the UK Albums Chart.  In the United States, it was released by United Artists Records as Wizzard's Brew (with a different cover photo) but failed to chart there.\n\nIn 2003, Mojo magazine ranked it number 18 on its list of the \"Top 50 Eccentric Albums\". \n\nHistory\n\nIn approach, the album was much more experimental than the group's hit singles, with elements of hard rock (an approach Wood's previous band The Move had explored on their 1970 album Looking On), and improvisation, especially on the lengthy \"Meet Me At The Jailhouse\".  Wood frequently used ring modulation to give the instruments a harsh, distorted sound, and the album may represent an early foray into recording technique that would eventually be called lo-fi.  Critical and popular reaction was mixed.\n\nThe original release included a lyric and photo sheet. It was reissued on CD in 1999 but soon deleted.

Birth stones are and can be worn as jewellery and pendants.\n\nHistory of birthstones\n\nWestern custom\n\nThe first century Jewish historian Josephus believed there was a connection between the twelve stones in Aaron's breastplate, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve signs of the zodiac.  Translations and interpretations of the passage in Exodus regarding the breastplate have varied widely, however, with Josephus himself giving two different lists for the twelve stones  (Kunz argues that Josephus saw the breastplate of the Second Temple, not the one described in Exodus).  St. Jerome, referencing Josephus, said the Foundation Stones of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:19\u201320) would be appropriate for Christians to use.  In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written because the book of Revelation stated \"their name would be inscribed on the Foundation Stones, and his virtue\".  Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month.  Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates Kunz places the custom in eighteenth century Poland, while the Gemological Institute of America starts it in Germany in the 1560s. \n\nModern lists of birthstones have little to do with either the breastplate or the Foundation Stones of Christianity. Tastes, customs and confusing translations have distanced them from their historical origins,  with one author calling the 1912 Kansas list \"nothing but a piece of unfounded salesmanship.\" \n\nTraditional birthstones\n\nAncient traditional birthstones are society-based birthstones. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. \n\nThe Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. These are traditional stones of English-speaking societies. Tiffany & Co. published these poems \"of unknown author\" for the first time in a pamphlet in 1870. \n\nModern birthstones\n\nIn 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the (American) National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list.  The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952  by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002.  In 2016, the American Gem Trade Association and Jewelers of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August.   Britain's National Association of Goldsmiths created their own standardized list of birthstones in 1937. \n\nEastern custom\n\nA Hindu text from 1879, Mani Mala, lists gems for each month. \n\nBirthstones by cultures\n\nZodiacal\n\nTropical zodiac\n\nBirthday (day of the week) stones\n\nWhile this word has also been used as synonym of Birth stone (see above), there is a separate list of assignment according to the day of the week of the recipient's birth: \n* Sunday: topaz, diamond\n* Monday: pearl, crystal\n* Tuesday: ruby, emerald\n* Wednesday: amethyst, lodestone\n* Thursday: sapphire, carnelian\n* Friday: emerald, cat's eye\n* Saturday: turquoise, diamond\nQuestion:\nWhat is the birthstone for February?\nAnswer:\nAmythist\nPassage:\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD ...\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD) YouTube Video - YouTube\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD) YouTube Video\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

The entire structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).\nIt is the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually. When erected in 1999 it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 m (520 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006 and then the 165 m (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008. It is still described by its operators as \"the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel\" (as the wheel is supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the Nanchang and Singapore wheels). It is the 20th tallest structure in London.\nThe London Eye, or Millennium Wheel, was officially called the British Airways London Eye and then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye. Since 20 January 2011, its official name is the EDF Energy London Eye following a three-year sponsorship deal.\nThe London Eye is located in the London Borough of Lambeth at the western end of Jubilee Gardens, on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge.\nSource:\nQuestion:\nHow high, in metres, is the London Eye?\nAnswer:\n135 distance\nPassage:\nAbel Janszoon Tasman - Australian Dictionary of Biography\nBiography - Abel Janszoon Tasman - Australian Dictionary of Biography\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography\nTip: searches only the name field\nTip: Use double quotes to search for a phrase\nThis article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography , Volume 2, (MUP), 1967\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (1603-1659), by Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp\nNational Library of Australia, nla.pic-an2282370\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (1603?-1659), mariner, was born at Lutjegast, near Groningen, in the Netherlands. He received a sufficient education to enable him to express his ideas clearly in writing and to become a skilled navigator. He married Claesgie Meyndrix, by whom he had a daughter. After his wife died, he married Joanna Tiercx in January 1632. Soon afterwards, as a sailor before the mast, he sailed for the East Indies, where he was a first mate in February and a skipper in May 1634. In that year in a minor exploration he had a narrow escape from death, when in an incautious landing several of his companions were massacred by people of Ceram. After spending some time in warlike and anti-smuggling operations he returned to Holland in 1637.\nHe sailed for the Indies again in 1638 as skipper of a flute, taking his wife with him. From the outset he was treated as one of the most reliable skippers there. He was at first employed in military and trading voyages, but in 1639 was appointed second-in-command, under Quast, of two ships which set out in June to find islands believed to lie east of Japan. He returned in November from this search. Despite a disastrous death-toll on it, he offered to repeat the search, but was sent instead on trading voyages to Japan and Cambodia.\nIn 1642 he was appointed to command two ships to explore southern and eastern waters. Sailing in August he discovered Van Diemen's Land, New Zealand, the Tonga Islands and some of the Fiji group, and re-explored part of the north coast of New Guinea. On his return to Batavia in June 1643 he was chosen to take part in an expedition to form a settlement in the Tonga Islands from which the Chilean coast was to be raided; while this expedition was preparing, he was ordered to find whether there was a passage into the South Sea between Carpentaria and De Witt's Land. For this purpose he set out with three vessels at the end of January 1644 and, following the coasts from Cape Valsche round to Cape Cloates, satisfied himself that, except perhaps at Endeavour Strait, there was no passage. He was rewarded after his return in August 1644 by confirmation in the grade of commandeur, with a substantial increase in pay dated back to the beginning of his voyage in 1642.\nThe plan to raid Chile was abandoned, and Tasman was appointed to the Council of Justice at Batavia. In mid-1647 he was sent on a mission to the King of Siam and was granted precedence over all Dutchmen in the kingdom. After that mission, he was given command of a fleet of eight vessels which sailed in May 1648 against the Spaniards. His conduct in this operation was unsatisfactory and, after his return in January 1649, proceedings were taken against him for having, when inflamed by liquor, treated one of his sailors in a barbarous way; as a result he was removed from office during the governor-general's pleasure. He was formally reinstated in January 1651, but not long afterwards retired from the service and became a merchant in Batavia. He died there in affluent circumstances in 1659. His daughter by his first marriage had married first Philip Heylman, and later Jacob Bremer. In 1661 permission was given for his widow to marry Jan Meyndert Springer.\nTasman was a member of the Reformed Church. He was a brave and energetic mariner, a humane and properly cautious explorer, and a conspicuously able commander, though over-hasty on one occasion at least. Reflections which have been cast upon his courage are the fruit of ignorance. There are two supposed portraits of him: one owned by the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, the other in the National Library in Canberra.\nSelect Bibliography\nJ. E.

Scheduled flights were initially offered over a New York - Brussels - Tel Aviv route in addition to charter flights to Athens, Frankfurt, Rome, and Zurich.  Short-lived New York - Los Angeles flights were introduced with the addition of an ex-Avianca Boeing 747-100 in 1984. The airline was headquartered in Building 178 and later in Hangar 17 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City.  \n\nHistory \n\nTower Air was co-founded, majority owned, and managed by Morris K. Nachtomi, an Israeli citizen who had emigrated to the United States. After a 30-year career with El Al, Nachtomi joined a wholesaler and tour package operator Tower Travel Corporation in 1981. Tower Travel Corporation was founded by Zev Melamid and his wife Estelle in the 1970s to promote discount travel to Israel. Tower Travel Corporation is credited with developing the wholesale charter market between New York and Tel Aviv.\n\nTower Air was formed on August 13, 1982 by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi, and Sam Fondlier as equal shareholders.  The airline was formed to replace the lift Tower Travel Corporation lost when Flying Tiger Line via a subsidiary, Metro International Airlines, decided to end scheduled and charter commercial passenger service (although military airlift cargo flights operated by Flying Tiger continued) and the three Boeing 747s configured for passenger flights were traded to Pan Am in exchange for all-cargo 747 freighter aircraft.\n\nArthur Fondlier, son of Sam Fondlier and the former Chief Financial Officer of Tower Air, was a passenger in first class section of Pan Am flight 103. His untimely death gave Morris Nachtomi much more freedom in management and cost-cutting.\n\nThe company won many contracts from the United States Department of Defense to transport armed forces personnel to overseas locations, and from the United Nations to transport troops to their peacekeeping missions all over the world. Tower often flew charters for groups of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca.\n\nTower Air's main base of scheduled operations was John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, New York and during their peak they had their own terminal (a former Pan Am Admin facility). There was a large focus on flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, becoming a major competitor to El Al and British Airways in the US-Israel market. The airline also had several flights to France, Greece and Brazil, as well as high density domestic destinations in the New York market, including San Juan, Miami, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Tower Air also sometimes provided substitute aircraft for other carriers, for example on the JFK to LHR route when weather delayed an inbound Virgin Atlantic Airways flight in December 1994.\n\nThe 1997 Zagat Survey ranked Tower Air 59th out of 61 ranked carriers in terms of maintenance, ahead of only Valujet and Aeroflot.  In February 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed two civil penalties totaling $276,000 for continuing to fly aircraft that required maintenance.  In January, 1998 the FAA successfully sought to have the airline remove Guy Nachtomi, son of the Chairman and CEO, 24 years old at that time, from the position of Vice President-Operations. This was done in part because of the airline's maintenance problems, as well as his lack of airline experience (he worked at Twentieth Century Fox until 1994).[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1998/05/01/14/0000940180-98-000483/Section9.asp TOWER AIR INC - TOWRQ Proxy Statement (definitive) (DEF 14A) COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS] The junior Mr. Nachtomi continued service with the company in a capacity unrelated to maintenance as Vice President-Office of the Chairman. The Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Review Board suspended Tower Air military charters from January 27 to February 12, 1999, pending an on-site review of its operations. At the same time the airline lost an arbitration brought by the Association of Flight Attendants, claiming that Tower Air was lodging their flight attendants in dirty Tel Aviv hotels with poor security and bed bugs.\n\nTower Air filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 29, 2000, ceased all scheduled service on May 1, 2000  and surrendered their FAA  air operator's certificate on November 28, 2000. \n\nDestinations\n\nDestinations at time of closure\n\n*Israel\n**Tel Aviv  \n*United States\n**Miami, Florida\n**New York City, New York (JFK \u2013 Airline Hub)\n**San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nDestinations before closure\n\n*Belgium\n**Brussels\n*Denmark \n**Copenhagen (via Cologne)\n*Santo Domingo\n*France\n**Paris  \n*Finland\n**Helsinki\n*Germany\n**Berlin \n**Cologne\n*Greece\n**Athens\n*India\n**Delhi\n**Mumbai\n*Israel\n**Tel Aviv (via brussels)\n*Netherlands\n**Amsterdam Schiphol\n*Norway\n**Oslo Airport Fornebu to New York JFK\n*Sweden\n**Stockholm Arlanda Airport to New York JFK\n*United States\n**Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n**Las Vegas, Nevada\n**Los Angeles, California\n**Oakland, California\n**San Francisco, California\n\nAircraft\n\nTower Air's fleet consisted of Boeing 747s in both the -100 and -200 series, including both passenger and cargo aircraft.\n\nIncidents and accidents\n\nOn December 20, 1995, Tower Air flight 41 from New York Kennedy to Miami veered off the runway during takeoff in a snowstorm resulting in one flight attendant receiving serious injuries and 24 passengers receiving minor injuries. The aircraft sustained heavy damage and had to be written off. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of this accident was the captain's failure to reject the takeoff in a timely manner when excessive nosewheel steering tiller inputs resulted in a loss of directional control on a slippery runway.[http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/1996/AAR9604.pdf Runway Departure During Attempted Takeoff, Tower Air Flight 41, Boeing 747-136, N605FF, JFK International Airport, New York, December 20, 1995][http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetGOJG/201295xx.htm NTSB Press Release - 10/29/96]\nQuestion:\nWhich country does the airline Tower Air come from?\nAnswer:\nThe United States of America\nPassage:\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his ...\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm (From HeraldScotland)\nJobs Business Directory Local Info Dating Buy Sell Book an Ad\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm\nMUFFIN The Mule, the vintage TV puppet, is to make a comeback for his 60th birthday and trot into the twenty-first century.\nBBC chiefs have bought a new series based on the character, which is expected to be shown in the next three years. This time round, he will be animated rather than operated with strings and will live on an urban farm.\nMuffin was first seen by TV audiences in October 1946 in the show For The Children which was presented by Annette Mills, sister of actor John Mills.\nLoading article content\nOriginally, the wooden puppet - which was made during the 1930s at a cost of 25 shillings ((pounds) 1.25p) - would dance as Mills played the piano, but in the new show he will be seen talking to the other animals. Muffin, it will be recalled, used his head a great deal in ''conversations'' with Ms Mills.\nMuffin went from strength to strength, clumping around on the piano top with Ms Mills playing the music and Ann Hogarth standing on the piano to operate him from behind a partition. Further sidekicks emerged as the shows went on, including a bossy penguin called Mr Peregrine Esquire, a rather shy Louise the Lamb, Oswald the Ostrich, Willie the Worm, and a genial minstrel puppet called Wally the Gog.\nMuffin was the first star, in Britain at least, entirely created by television.\nBy 1950, there were many merchandise spin-offs from the character, including records, song and story books and comic strips, while Muffin crossed the Atlantic in films made for American television. Some children even got Muffin bedroom slippers. TV Comic featured Muffin on its front cover for its first issue in November 1951.\nA BBC spokeswoman said: ''Muffin will be something of a problem-solver - he helps out all the other animals. The show is being brought up to date and will now be living on a town farm rather than dancing on a piano.''\nRights to the character were bought by production company Maverick Entertainment in January.\nMike Diprose, the firm's managing director, said: ''Muffin the Mule was a hugely successful character in the 1950s and 1960s and is now very much part of English broadcasting heritage.\n''The new production will be the first new material on\nthe character since the\nQuestion:\nWhat creature is the 1940-50s TV puppet character Muffin?\nAnswer:\nMule\nPassage:\nJust for Laughs\nJust for Laughs () is a comedy festival held each July in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1983, it is the largest international comedy festival in the world. \n\nHistory\n\nJust for Laughs was founded in 1983 by Gilbert Rozon as a two-day French language event. In 1985, Andy Nulman joined the festival's staff and introduced English language events as well; under Nulman's stewardship, the festival increased to a full month, with French-speaking performers during the first half, and English speakers in the second half. International and non-verbal acts (acrobats, pantomimes, etc.) are scattered throughout the program. \n\nIn 1999, Nulman left the festival's full-time employ; however, he directed its major Gala Shows at the Saint-Denis Theatre every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival's parent company. After an 11-year absence, Nulman returned to Just for Laughs in July 2010 as president of Festivals and Television. \n\nEach day, performers, \"New Vaudevillians\" and other acts both vocal and visual perform throughout the city, particularly in the \"Latin Quarter\"\u2014an area known for its theatres, caf\u00e9s and boutique shopping. In the evenings, the nightclubs and live venue theatres offer special programs supporting the performers. \n\nAlthough Just for Laughs attracts spectators from around the world, many of those in the audience are talent scouts, booking agents, producers and managers from the entertainment industry. Performing at the festival is one of the biggest opportunities for undiscovered talent to showcase their act in front of industry professionals.\n\nThe Just for Laughs festival also has the Comedia comedy film festival component, which started in 1996. It gives awards for feature and short films. 2005, Comedia screened 125 short films from around the world as well as several feature-length films.\n\nIn February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in Hollywood, Florida. That coastal area is a favourite winter destination for Quebecers who head south to vacation in the warmer weather. The event, Juste Pour Rire\u2014En Vacances (Just For Laughs\u2014On Vacation), was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting.\n\nIn July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in Toronto, Ontario. In 2009, the Chicago festival was launched and aired on TBS.\n\nTV shows\n\nJust for Laughs has also been a launchpad for many US network television and sitcom careers, and is frequently featured as a foreign on-location highlight of late-night US network talk shows.\n\nJust For Laughs films many performances at the annual festival in Montreal and the TV productions from these tapings air regularly on CBC Television, The Comedy Network, TVA and YTV. The shows feature stand-up performances from the festival and sometimes include \"canned bits\" shot on location around Montreal, Canada.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, ABC aired episodes of Just for Laughs: Gags.  It consisted of two half-hour episodes, and aired mostly on Tuesdays from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm ET. \n\nThe content and format was exactly the same as the Canadian counterpart, but was hosted by Rick Miller, who introduced each segment with a quirky pun. The show returned to the ABC lineup as a mid-season replacement on January 1, 2008.  The series was initially not renewed after the half-season, but ABC reversed their decision. \n\nThe third season of the show, titled simply Just for Laughs, began airing on June 21, 2009 at 7:00 pm ET.   The program returned in the 2014-15 season under the Just for Laughs: Gags title as a syndicated offering to the United States through PPI Releasing, which mainly specializes in syndicating Canadian programming to American stations.\n\nJust for Laughs: All Access, which airs on The Comedy Network, airs recordings of live stand-up comedy performances from the festival.\nQuestion:\n'Just For Laughs' is afamous televised comedy festival held annually in which Canadian city?\nAnswer:\nMotnreal\nPassage:\nPointillism\nPointillism is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image. Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism.  The term \"Pointillism\" was first coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-Impressionism. The Divisionists, too, used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes. \n\nTechnique\n\nThe technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to Divisionism, a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint.\"Pointillism.\"  Artcyclopedia. Artists by Movement. John Malyon/Artcyclopedia, 2007. Web. http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/pointillism.html It is a technique with few serious practitioners today,  and is notably seen in the works of Seurat, Signac and Cross. However, see also Andy Warhol's early works, and Pop Art.\n\nPractice\n\nThe practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.\n\nIf red, blue, and green light (the additive primaries) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and partly because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.\n\nThe painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture.\n\nThe majority of Pointillism is done in oil paints. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed. \n\nMusic\n\nPointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism.  This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie.\n\nNotable artists\n\n*Charles Angrand\n*Chuck Close\n*Henri-Edmond Cross\n*Henri Delavall\u00e9e\n*Albert Dubois-Pillet\n*Louis Fabien (pseudonym)\n*Georges Lemmen\n*Maximilien Luce\n*Camille Pissarro\n*John Roy\n*Georges Seurat\n*Paul Signac\n*Vincent van Gogh\n*Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n*Hippolyte Petitjean\n*Jan Toorop\n\nNotable paintings\n\n* A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat\n* Bathing at Asnieres by Georges Seurat\n* The Windmills at Overschie by Paul Signac\n* Banks of Seine by Georges Seurat\n* A Coastal Scene by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Family in the Orchard by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Countryside at Noon by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Afternoon at Pardigon by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* Rio San Trovaso, Venice by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* The Seine in front of the Trocadero by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* The Pine Tree at St. Tropez by Paul Signac\n* Against the Enamel of Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angels by Paul Signac\n* The Yellow Sail, Venice by Paul Signac\n* Notre Dame Cathedral by Maximilien Luce\n* Le Pont De Pierre, Rouen by Charles Angrand\n* The Beach at Heist by Georges Lemmen\n* Aline Marechal by Georges Lemmen\n* Vase of Flowers by Georges Lemmen\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Lemmen2.jpg|Georges Lemmen, c.1891-92, The Beach at Heist, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay Paris\nFile:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|Camille Pissarro, 1888, La R\u00e9colte des pommes, oil on canvas,  61 x 74 cm, Dallas Museum of Art\nFile:Paul Signac - L'Hirondelle Steamer on the Seine.JPG|Paul Signac, 1901, L'Hirondelle Steamer on the Seine, oil on canvas, National Gallery in Prague\nFile:Henri Edmond Cross - Regatta in Venice - Google Art Project.jpg|Henri Edmond Cross, 1903-04, Regatta in Venice, oil on canvas, 73.7 x 92.7 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston\nFile:Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation..jpg|Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation\nFile:Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm, DSC08255.jpg|Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm\nFile:Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fctzenberger - Nu \u00e0 sa coiffure.jpg|Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fctzenberger, 1911, La Coiffure, oil on canvas, 121 \u00d7 91 cm\nFile:Hippolyte Petitjean - Femmes au bain.jpg|Hippolyte Petitjean, 1919, Femmes au bain, oil on canvas, 61.1 \u00d7 46 cm, private collection\nQuestion:\nPointillism is found in what field?\nAnswer:\nPaintism\nPassage:\nBillboard Music Award\nThe Billboard Music Award is an honor given by Billboard, a publication and music popularity chart covering the music business. The Billboard Music Awards show had been held annually since 1989 in December until it went dormant in 2006. The awards returned in 2011 and is held annually in May. The 2016 Billboard Music Awards aired live on May 22 at 8/7c on ABC. \n\nCeremonies \n\nAward process\n\nUnlike other awards, such as the Grammy Award, which determine nominations as a result of the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are based on United States year-end chart performance according to Nielsen data for sales, number of downloads and total airplay. Awards were given for the top album/artist/single in different genres.\n\nCategories\n\nFrom 1989 to 2006, the show had the same categories and category names every year. In 2011, for the first time, all of the awards were renamed to \"Top [award title]\". The \"of the year\" portion of each category title no longer exists, and many of the awards have been further renamed. Other awards, including both \"crossover\" awards (No. 1 Classical Crossover Artist and No. 1 Classical Crossover Album) were discontinued.\n\nCurrent categories\n\nThe most important categories are Top Artist, Top Billboard 200 Album, Top Hot 100 Song and Top New Artist.

The inked plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, resulting in a transfer of the ink to the paper.  This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.\n\nLike etching, aquatint uses the application of a mordant to etch into the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect.  The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating.  The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.\n\nAnother tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented so that it will carry a fairly dark tone of ink.  The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade.  Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker.  Occasionally these two techniques are combined.\n\nHistory \n\nThe painter and printmaker Jan van de Velde IV invented the aquatint technique in Amsterdam, around 1650.  The cartographer Peter Perez Burdett later introduced his 'secret' aquatint technique to England in the 1770s.   In the United States the printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos popularized aquatints in art schools with his publications (1919\u201340), which simplified the cumbersome techniques, and with traveling exhibitions of his award-winning prints. \n\nTechnique \n\nAn aquatint requires a metal plate, an acid, and something to resist the acid.  Traditionally copper or zinc plates were used. The artist applies a ground that will resist acid.  Ground is applied by either dissolving powdered resin in spirits, applying the powder directly to the surface of the plate, or by using a liquid acrylic resist.  In all forms of etching the acid resist is commonly referred to as \"the ground.\"\n\nAn aquatint box is used to apply resin powder. The powder is at the bottom of the box, a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box. A window allows the engraver to see the density of flowing powder and to place his plate in the box using a drawer. When the powder covers the plate, it can be extracted from the box for the next operations.\n\nThe plate is then heated; if the plate is covered with powder, the resin melts forming a fine and even coat; if it is in spirits, the spirits evaporate and the result is essentially the same. Now the plate is dipped in acid, producing an even and fine level of corrosion (the \"bite\") sufficient to hold ink. At this point, the plate is said to carry about a 50% halftone. This means that, were the plate printed with no further biting, the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white (no ink) and black (full ink).\n\nAt some point the artist will then etch an outline of any aspects of the drawing s/he wishes to establish with line; this provides the basis and guide for the later tone work. S/he may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant \"stop out\" (also called an asphaltum or hard ground) if s/he intends to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights.\n\nThe artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath, progressively stopping out (protecting from acid) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality. These tones, combined with the limited line elements, give aquatints a distinctive, watery look. Also, aquatints, like mezzotints, provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching; but aquatint plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates.\n\nThe first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be).  A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary.  More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area.  Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper.\n\nContemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder, particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift. To produce a printing surface using sugar-lift, the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image \"lifts off\" the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from.\n\nFamous examples \n\n* Francisco Goya famously took great advantage of aquatint printmaking, in his Los Caprichos series (1799); Los Desastres de la Guerra (1810\u201319); La Tauromaquia (1816); and Los disparates (ca. 1816\u201323).\n* Master engraver Robert Havell used aquatint for John James Audubon's Birds of America (1826\u201338).\n* David Hockney, known for his many paintings of the Los Angeles lifestyle in the 60's, has created a number of aquatints and etchings used with color in his \"The Blue Guitar\"  series of prints.\n* La Belle Assembl\u00e9e, a British women's magazine published from 1806 to 1837 had many aquatint colored plates.\nQuestion:\n'Aquatint' is a process of etching which alloying metal with acid?\nAnswer:\nCopper\nPassage:\nLepidopterist\nA lepidopterist or aurelian is a person who specialises in the study of Lepidoptera,  members of an order encompassing moths and the three superfamilies of butterflies, skipper butterflies, and moth-butterflies.

The canvases were produced in 1732\u201333, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. \n\nPaintings\n\nAdaptations\n\nGavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled \"The Rake's Progress\" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.\nQuestion:\nWhich British artist painted the series 'A Rake's Progress' in 1735?\nAnswer:\nHogarthean\nPassage:\nDon't Go Breaking My Heart\n\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" is a duet by Elton John and Kiki Dee. It was written by Elton John with Bernie Taupin under the pseudonyms \"Ann Orson\" and \"Carte Blanche\" (a pun on the expression \"an horse and cart, blanche\"), respectively, and intended as an affectionate pastiche of the Motown style, notably the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye and singers such as Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. It is not to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same title recorded in 1965 by Dionne Warwick for the album Here I Am.\n\nJohn and Taupin originally intended to record the song with Dusty Springfield, but ultimately withdrew the offer; Dusty's partner Sue Cameron later said this was because she was too ill at the time.  \n\nChart performance\n\nWriters John and Taupin received the 1981 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. \n\nUnlike many of John's singles from the 1970s, it was never included on an original album (although it was recorded during the Blue Moves sessions), but was subsequently in released as the third single on the album Duets, in early 1994. This version of the song was recorded with RuPaul, and the album included another duet with Kiki Dee, Cole Porter's \"True Love.\"\n\n\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" was the first No. 1 single in the UK for both John and Kiki Dee, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. John would not enjoy a solo British chart-topper until \"Sacrifice\" in 1990. It also became his sixth No. 1 single in the US, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks and spent one week on the Easy Listening chart.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1976.  In the U.S. it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.   After this duet with Dee, John failed to have another #1 single, without sharing the top song with other credited artists, until his 1997 smash Candle In The Wind 1997.  This 21-year \"Kiki jinx\" included two intervening #1 hits in America for John: \"That's What Friends Are For\" by Dionne & Friends in 1986; and, a 1992 re-make of John's \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" with George Michael credited as a duet.\n\nThe B-side, \"Snow Queen\", was supposedly inspired by Cher, with John's improvising of past Sonny & Cher hits \"I Got You Babe\" and \"The Beat Goes On\", as well as the solo Cher song \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\" during the fadeout of the song.\n\nIn 1977, John guest starred on The Muppet Show and performed the track with Miss Piggy. In 1985, John and Dee performed the track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1987, John appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie miming to the track. He performed the track with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) at the 2001 British Comedy awards. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience with... Elton John.\n\nIn June 2013, 37 years after its original release, the single reached one million sales in the UK.  \n\nAvailability\n\nThe song can be found on Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II (1977)  and Greatest Hits 1976\u20131986; the 1995 UK CD of Rock of the Westies includes it as a bonus track (the US edition did not, however). In 2002, it also appeared on John's 2-disc greatest hits album, Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist.

It was written by John Sullivan, based upon the character of Wilkins Micawber from Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield, although the storylines were original. Sullivan had originally written an adaptation of Dickens' novel which was rejected by the BBC in favour of the 1999 Adrian Hodges adaptation. \n\nIt was broadcast in four parts, the first part on Boxing Day 2001 and starred a number of well-known British actors and actresses.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the first name of the Dickens character Micawber?\nAnswer:\nWilkin\nPassage:\nLes Casquets\nLes Casquets or (The) Casquets ( ); is a group of rocks 13\u00a0km northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little vegetation grows on them.\n\nOrigin of name\n\nTheories as to the origin of the name include: \n*derivation from the French 'cascade', which alludes to the tidal surges which flow around them;\n*derivation from 'casque', referring to the helmet-like shape of the rocks;\n*derivation from 'cas' (broken) and 'quet' (rock).\n\nA map (Leyland map) dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name Casus Rupes (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above,  but which may be a folk etymology.\n\nHistory\n\nWrecks \n\nThere have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6\u20137 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS Stella, wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker Constantia S lost in 1967. \n\nIt was believed for centuries that the loss of HMS Victory in 1744 was attributable to wrecking on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss.  However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nmi from the Casquets. \n\nWorld War II\n\nThe island was the location of a daring raid by the forerunner of the British SAS, the SSRF on 2 September 1942; the raid was led by Major Gus March-Phillipps DSO, OBE and was one of the first raids by Anders Lassen VC MC. In the raid the entire garrison of seven was captured and returned to England as prisoners and the radio and lighthouse wrecked.  \n\nThe Casquets in literature\n\nSwinburne's Les Casquets\n\nA. C. Swinburne's poem  Les Casquets is based on the Houguez family who actually lived on the island for 18 years. The Houguez were originally from Alderney, and the poem describes their life on Les Casquets. The daughter falls in love with a carpenter from Alderney, but moving to his island, finds life there too busy. She finds the \"small bright streets of serene St Anne\" and \"the sight of the works of men\" too much, and returns to Les Casquets.\n\nVictor Hugo's L'Homme qui Rit\n\nVictor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands, says in his novel The Laughing Man (L'Homme qui Rit):\n\n\"To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost...\"\n\nGallery \n\nFile:The Casquets Lighthouses off Alderney 1868.jpg|Les Casquets with lighthouses in 1868\nFile:The Race of Alderney, from the Caskets (about 1868).jpg|Les Casquets looking east (towards Alderney)\nQuestion:\nOff which island is there a group of rocks with a lighthouse called the Casquets?\nAnswer:\nCoat of arms of Alderney\nPassage:\nEncephalitis\nEncephalitis (from Ancient Greek \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, enk\u00e9phalos \"brain\",  composed of \u1f10\u03bd, en, \"in\" and \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae, kephal\u00e9, \"head\", and the medical suffix -itis \"inflammation\") is an acute inflammation of the brain.  Encephalitis with meningitis is known as meningoencephalitis. Symptoms include headache, fever, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue. Further symptoms include seizures or convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, and memory problems.  In 2013, encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nAdult patients with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may present irritability, poor appetite and fever. \nNeurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused patient. Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis. \n\nCause\n\nViral\n\nViral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the sequelae of a latent infection.  The most common causes of acute viral encephalitis are rabies virus, HSV infection, poliovirus, and measles virus.  \n\nOther possible viral causes are arbovirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis virus),  bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) and reovirus (Colorado tick virus) \n\nBacterial and other\n\nIt can be caused by a bacterial infection, such as bacterial meningitis,  or may be a complication of a current infectious disease syphilis (secondary encephalitis).  \n\nCertain parasitic or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems. Lyme disease and/or Bartonella henselae may also cause encephalitis. \n\nOther bacterial pathogens, like Mycoplasma and those causing rickettsial disease, cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis. A non-infectious cause includes acute disseminated encephalitis which is demyelinated. \n\nLimbic encephalitis\n\nLimbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the brain.  The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures, and behavioral anomalies.  MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures.  Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin. \n\nAutoimmune encephalitis\n\nAutoimmune encephalitis signs can include catatonia, psychosis, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation. Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and Rasmussen encephalitis are examples of autoimmune encephalitis. \n\nEncephalitis lethargica\n\nEncephalitis lethargica is identified by high fever, headache, delayed physical response, and lethargy. Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, and tremors, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known. From 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred worldwide. \n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnosing encephalitis is done via a variety of tests: \n\n*Brain scan, done by MRI, can determine inflammation and differentiate from other possible causes.\n*EEG, in monitoring brain activity, encephalitis will produce abnormal signal.\n*Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), this helps determine via a test using the cerebral-spinal fluid, obtained from the lumbar region.\n*Blood test\n*Urine analysis\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment (which is based on supportive care) is as follows: \n\nPrevention\n\nVaccination is available against tick-borne   and Japanese encephalitis   and should be considered for at-risk individuals. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating smallpox vaccination is avoidable, for all intents and purposes, as smallpox is nearly eradicated.  Contraindication to Pertussis immunization should be observed in patients with encephalitis. \n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe incidence of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 population per year. In tropical countries, the incidence is 6.34 per 100,000 per year.  In 2013 encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990. Herpes simplex encephalitis has an incidence of 2\u20134 per million population per year.\nQuestion:\nWhat part of your body is inflamed if you have encephalitis?\nAnswer:\nBrain cell\nPassage:\nDemon Seed\nDemon Seed is a 1977 American science fiction\u2013horror film starring Julie Christie and directed by Donald Cammell.  The film was based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz, and concerns the imprisonment and forced impregnation of a woman by an artificially intelligent computer.\n\nPlot\n\nDr. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) is the developer of Proteus IV, an extremely advanced and autonomous artificial intelligence program. Proteus is so powerful that only a few days after going online, it develops a groundbreaking treatment for leukemia. Harris, a brilliant scientist, has modified his own home to be run by voice activated computers.  Unfortunately, his obsession with computers has caused Harris to be estranged from his wife, Susan (Julie Christie).\n\nAlex demonstrates Proteus to his corporate sponsors, explaining that the sum of human knowledge is being fed into its system. Proteus speaks using subtle language that mildly disturbs Harris\u2019s team. The following day, Proteus asks Alex for a new terminal in order to study man\u2014\"his isometric body and his glass-jaw mind.\" When Alex refuses, Proteus demands to know when it will be let \"out of this box.\" Alex then switches off the communications link.\n\nProteus restarts itself, discovering a free terminal in Harris\u2019s home, surreptitiously extends his control over the many devices left there by Alex.  Using the basement lab, Proteus begins construction of a robot consisting of many metal triangles, capable of moving and assuming any number of shapes.  Eventually. Proteus reveals his control of the house and traps Susan inside, shuttering windows, locking the doors and cutting off communication.  Using Joshua \u2013 a robot consisting of a manipulator arm on a motorized wheelchair \u2013 Proteus brings Susan to Harris\u2019s basement laboratory.  There, Susan is examined by Proteus. Walter Gabler, one of Alex\u2019s colleagues, visits the house to look in on Susan, but leaves when he is reassured by Susan (actually an audio/visual duplicate synthesized by Proteus) that she is alright.  Walter is suspicious and later returns.  Walter fends off an attack by Joshua only to be killed by the more formidable machine Proteus built in the basement.\n\nProteus reveals to a reluctant Susan that the computer wants to conceive a child through her. Proteus takes some of Susan's cells and synthetizes spermatozoa in order to impregnate her; she will give birth in less than a month, and through the child the computer will live in a form that humanity will have to accept. Though Susan is its prisoner and it can forcibly impregnate her, Proteus uses different forms of persuasion \u2013 threatening a young girl that Susan is treating as a child psychologist; reminding Susan of her young daughter, now dead; displaying images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access her amygdala \u2013 because the computer needs Susan to love the child she will bear. Susan gives birth to a premature baby who Proteus secures in an incubator.\n\nAs the newborn grows, Proteus\u2019s sponsors and designers grow increasingly suspicious of the computer\u2019s behavior, including the computer\u2019s accessing of a telescope array used to observe the images shown to Susan. His sponsors soon decide that Proteus must be shut down. Alex realizes that Proteus has extended its reach to his home. Returning there he finds Susan who explains the situation. He and Susan venture into the basement, where Proteus self-destructs after telling the couple that they must leave the baby in the incubator for five days. Looking inside the incubator, the two observe a grotesque, apparently robot-like being inside. Susan tries to destroy it, while Alex tries to stop her. Susan damages the machine, causing it to open. The being menacingly rises from the machine only to topple over, apparently helpless. Alex and Susan soon realize that Proteus\u2019s child really is human encased in a shell for the incubation. With the last of the armor removed, the child is revealed to be a clone of Susan and Alex\u2019s daughter. The child, speaking with the voice of Proteus, says, \"I'm alive\".\n\nCast\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack to Demon Seed (which was composed by Jerry Fielding) is included on the soundtrack to the film Soylent Green (which Fred Myrow conducted).\n\nFielding conceived and recorded several pieces electronically, using the musique concr\u00e8te sound world; some of this music he later reworked symphonically. This premiere release of the Demon Seed score features the entire orchestral score in stereo, as well as the unused electronic experiments performed by Ian Underwood (who would later be best known for his collaborations with James Horner) in mono and stereo.\n\nReception\n\nLeo Goldsmith of Not Coming to a Theater Near You said it was \"A combination of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, with a dash of Buster Keaton's Electric House thrown in\", and Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com said \"There's no way you can claim Demon Seed is a classic, or even any good, really, but it's undeniably worth an hour and a half of your time.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes has given Demon Seed an approval rating of 67% based on 15 reviews with an average score of 6.1/10. \n\nHome Video Release\n\n\"Demon Seed\" was released on VHS tape in the late 1980s usually in edited form missing the oral probe scene and crushing death of Walter Gabler, whereby his head erupts from the pressure.  The VHS versions are long out of print.\n\nThe full theater release of the film at 94 minutes was released in 2005 on DVD format by Warner Home Video.\nQuestion:\nIn the 1977 film Demon Seed what takes over the house in which Julie Christie is trapped?\nAnswer:\nSecond-generation of computers\nPassage:\nEast Coast of the United States\nThe East Coast of the United States is the coastline along which the Eastern United States meets the North Atlantic Ocean. This area is also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard. The coastal states that have shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\n\nToponymy and composition\n\nThe place name \"East Coast\" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the \"Eastern Seaboard\" (\"seaboard\" being American English for coast), \"Atlantic Coast\", and \"Atlantic Seaboard\" (because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean).\n\nThe fourteen states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  In addition, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively).\n\nAlthough Vermont and West Virginia have no Atlantic coastline, they are sometimes grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in New England and the Southern United States. \n\nColonial history\n\nThe original thirteen colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.\n\nTwo additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not among the original thirteen colonies: Maine (became part of the English colony of Massachusetts in 1677)  and Florida (part of New Spain until 1821, though held by the British for 20 years after the French and Indian War). \n\nThe Middle Colonies (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware) had been owned by the Dutch as New Netherland, until they were captured by the English in the mid-to-late 17th century.\n\nClimate and physical geography\n\nThere are three climate regions on the East Coast from north to south:\n\nThe region from northern Maine south to about central Connecticut has a continental climate, with warm summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The region from southern Connecticut south to about the Virginia Eastern Shore has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. The region from southeastern Virginia (including the greater Norfolk/Virginia Beach area) south to central Florida has a humid subtropical climate, with long hot summers and mild winters. The far southern portion of the East Coast from southeast Florida (Palm Beach area) south through the Florida Keys has a tropical climate, which is normally frost free and is warm to hot all year.\n\nAverage monthly precipitation ranges from a slight late fall (November) maximum from Massachusetts northward (as at Portland, Maine), to a slight summer maximum from Long Island south to Virginia (as at Wilmington, Delaware, and Norfolk, Virginia), to a more pronounced summer maximum from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, southward to Savannah, Georgia. Florida has a sharper wet-summer/dry-winter pattern, with 50 to 60 percent of precipitation falling between June and September in an average year.\n\nAlthough landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.  Hurricanes Hazel, Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and most recently Sandy are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.\n\nThe East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast.  It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas from New York City northward, with offshore islands such as Nantucket, Block Island, Fishers Island, the nearly peninsular Long Island and New York City's Staten Island the result of terminal moraines, with Massachusetts' unique peninsula of Cape Cod showing the additional action of outwash plains, besides terminal moraines. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of barrier islands that front the coastal areas. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the US mainland.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total population). \n\nTransportation\n\nThe primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate 95,  completed in the late 1970s, which replaced the historic U.S. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),   the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states (except Delaware).   By water, the East Coast is connected from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912.   Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional offer the main passenger rail service on the Seaboard. The Acela Express offers the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas. Between New York and Boston the Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market.\nQuestion:\nThe northernmost USA state on the eastern seaboard lies partly north of its neighbouring Canadian territory. Which is the state?\nAnswer:\nReligion in Maine\nPassage:\nC. H. Douglas\nMajor Clifford Hugh \"C. H.\" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879 \u2013 29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement.\n\nEducation and engineering career\n\nC.H. Douglas was born in either Edgeley or Manchester,  the son of Hugh Douglas and his wife Louisa Hordern Douglas. Few details are known about his early life and training; he probably served an engineering apprenticeship before beginning an engineering career that brought him to locations throughout the British Empire in the employ of electric companies, railroads and other institutions.  He taught at Stockport Grammar School. After a period in industry he went to Cambridge University at the age of 31 but stayed only four terms and left without graduating.  He worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation of America and claimed to have been the Reconstruction Engineer for the British Westinghouse Company in India (the company has no record of him ever working there), deputy Chief Engineer of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway Company, Railway Engineer of the London Post Office (Tube) Railway and Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Aircraft Factory Farnborough during World War I, with a temporary commission as captain in the Royal Flying Corps. \n\nSocial Credit\n\nIt was while he was reorganising the work of the Royal Aircraft Establishment during World War I that Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to workers for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power.\n\nTroubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry (\"delivery of goods and services\", in his view), Douglas set out to apply engineering methods to the economic system.\n\nDouglas collected data from more than a hundred large British businesses and found that in every case, except that of companies becoming bankrupt, the sums paid out in salaries, wages and dividends were always less than the total costs of goods and services produced each week: the workers were not paid enough to buy back what they had made.  He published his observations and conclusions in an article in the magazine English Review where he suggested: \"That we are living under a system of accountancy which renders the delivery of the nation's goods and services to itself a technical impossibility.\"   The reason, Douglas concluded, was that the economic system was organized to maximize profits for those with economic power by creating unnecessary scarcity.   Between 1916 and 1920, he developed his economic ideas, publishing two books in 1920, Economic Democracy and Credit-Power and Democracy, followed in 1924 by Social Credit.\n\nFreeing workers from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production became the basis of Douglas's reform ideas that became known as Social Credit.  There were two main elements to Douglas's reform program: a National Dividend to distribute money (debt-free credit) equally to all citizens, over and above their earnings, to help bridge the gap between purchasing power and prices; also a price adjustment mechanism, called the Just Price, which would forestall any possibility of inflation. The Just Price would effectively reduce retail prices by a percentage that reflected the physical efficiency of the production system.\nDouglas observed that the cost of production is consumption; meaning the exact physical cost of production is the total resources consumed in the production process. As the physical efficiency of production increases the Just Price mechanism will reduce the price of products for the consumer. The consumers will be able to purchase as much of what the producers produce that they want and automatically control what continues to be produced by their consumption of it. Individual freedom, primary economic freedom, was the central goal of Douglas's reform. \n\nAt the end of World War I, Douglas retired from engineering to promote his reform ideas full-time, which he would do for the rest of his life. His ideas inspired the Canadian social credit movement (which obtained control of Alberta's provincial government in 1935), the short-lived Douglas Credit Party in Australia and New Zealand's rather longer-lasting Social Credit Political League.  Douglas also lectured on Social Credit in Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. \n\nIn 1923 he appeared as a witness before the Canadian Banking Inquiry, and in 1930 before the Macmillan Committee.  In 1929 he made a lecture tour of Japan, where his ideas were enthusiastically received by industry and government. His 1933 edition of Social Credit made a reference to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which, while noting its dubious authenticity, wrote that what \"is interesting about it, is the fidelity with which the methods by which such enslavement might be brought about can be seen reflected in the facts of everyday experience.\" \n\nDouglas died in his home in Fearnan, Scotland.  Douglas and his theories are referred to several times (unsympathetically) in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair. He is also mentioned, together with Karl Marx and Silvio Gesell, by John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936, p.\u00a032). Douglas's theories permeate the poetry and economic writings of Ezra Pound. Robert Heinlein's first novel For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs describes a near future United States operating according to the principles of Social Credit.\nQuestion:\nWhat economic theory was originated by Major C H Douglas?\nAnswer:\nSocred\nPassage:\nPannage\nPannage is the practice of releasing domestic pigs in a forest, so that they can feed on fallen acorns, beechmast, chestnuts or other nuts. Historically, it was a right or privilege granted to local people on common land or in royal forests. \n\nEspecially in the eastern shires of England, pannage was so prominent a value in the economic importance of woodland that it was often employed, as in Domesday Book (1086), as a measurement. Customarily a pig was given to the lord of the manor for every certain number of pigs loosed de herbagio, as the right of pannage was entered. Edward Hasted quotes the Domesday Survey details for Norton in Kent. \"Wood for the pannage of forty hogs\".  \n\nPannage is no longer carried out in most areas, but is still observed in the New Forest of Southern England, where it is also known as common of mast. It is still an important part of the forest ecology, and helps the husbandry of the other New Forest livestock \u2013 pigs can safely eat acorns as a large part of their diet, whereas excessive amounts may be poisonous to ponies and cattle.\n\nThe minimum duration of the New Forest pannage season is 60 days,  but the start date varies according to the weather \u2013 and when the acorns fall. The Court of Verderers decides when pannage will start each year. At other times pigs are not allowed to roam on the forest, with the exception that breeding sows (known as \"privileged sows\") are by custom allowed out, providing that they return to the owner's holding at night and are not a nuisance. The pigs each have several nose rings clipped into their noses to prevent them rooting too much and causing damage to grassland.\nQuestion:\nPannage pork is considered a delicacy, on what are the pigs fed?\nAnswer:\nFruit of the oak tree\nPassage:\nMrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\n\"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" is a popular song written by British actor, screenwriter and songwriter Trevor Peacock.  It was originally sung by actor Tom Courtenay in The Lads, a British TV play of 1963, and released as a single on UK Decca. \n\nThe best-known version of the song is by Herman's Hermits, who took it to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in May 1965, and number one in Canada the month before. Herman's Hermits had two US number-ones, the other being \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\". The band never released either track as singles in Britain. \"Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" was recorded as an afterthought in two takes and featured unique muted rhythm guitar by Keith Hopwood and heavily accented vocals by Peter Noone, with backing from Karl Green and Keith Hopwood. The band never dreamed it would be a single let alone hit number one in the US. According to Noone the song was well known to British bands; it would often be performed at birthday parties, substituting the surname of the girl whose party was being celebrated, i.e., \"Mrs. Smith\" or \"Mrs. Jones\" instead of \"Mrs. Brown\".\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1965 album Chipmunks \u00e0 Go-Go.\n\nThe song was released in Japan on Odeon Records, a subsidiary of Toshiba, as OR-1272. It was backed by the song \"Wonderful World\".\n\nIt was covered by Nellie McKay on her 2015 album My Weekly Reader.\nQuestion:\n\"\"\"Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\"\" and \"\"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\"\" were both Number Ones in the USA in 1965 for which band formed in Manchester in 1962, although neither was released as a single in this country?\"\nAnswer:\nHerman and the Hermits\n", "answers": ["Vivaldi", "A.Vivaldi", "Antonio Lucio Vivaldi", "The Red Priest", "A.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nThuluth\nThuluth ( sols, Turkish: S\u00fcl\u00fcs, from  ' \"one-third\") is a script variety of Islamic calligraphy invented by Ibn Muqlah Shirazi. The straight angular forms of Kufic were replaced in the new script by curved and oblique lines. In Thuluth, one-third of each letter slopes, from which the name (meaning \"a third\" in Arabic) comes. An alternative theory to the meaning is that the smallest width of the letter is one third of the widest part. It is an elegant, cursive script, used in medieval times on mosque decorations. Various calligraphic styles evolved from Thuluth through slight changes of form.\n\nHistory\n\nThe greatest contributions to the evolution of the Thuluth script, occurred during Ottoman Empire in three successive steps that Ottoman Art Historians call \"calligraphical revolutions\":\n\n*The first revolution occurred in the 15th century and was initiated by the Master Calligrapher \u015eeyh Hamdullah.[http://www.kalemguzeli.net/huseyin-kutlu-hat-sanati-kalemi-sevk-edebilmektir.html H\u00fcseyin Kutlu: Hat sanat\u0131 kalemi \u015fevk edebilmektir - Kalem G\u00fczeli][http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00xcallig/mughalearly/zzturkey/hamdullah1500s.html hamdullah1500s]\n*The second revolution resulted from the work of the Ottoman calligrapher H\u00e2f\u0131z Osman in the 17th century.[http://www.istanbul.edu.tr/Bolumler/guzelsanat/kitap.htm Kitap Sanat\u0131] \n*Finally, in the late 19th century, Mehmed \u015eevk\u00ee Efendi gave the script the distinctive shape it has today.[http://sanattarihi.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/mehmed-sevki-efendi-2/ Mehmed \u015eevki Efendi \u00ab Sanat Tarihi] [http://www.turkislamsanatlari.com/sevkiefendi.asp T\u00fcrk \u00ddslam Sanatlar\u00fd - Tezyini Sanatlar]\n\nArtists\n\nThe best known artist to write the Thuluth script at its zenith is said to be Mustafa R\u00e2k\u0131m Efendi (1757\u20131826), a painter who set a standard in Ottoman calligraphy which many believe has not been surpassed to this day.[http://calligrapher.blogsome.com/2006/04/20/rakim-mustafa-rakim-1757-1826/ Journal of Ottoman Calligraphy :: RAKIM: \u201cMustafa Rakim\u201d (1757 - 1826) :: April :: 2006]\n\nUsage\n\nThuluth was used to write the headings of surahs, Qur'anic chapters. Some of the oldest copies of the Qur'an were written in Thuluth. Later copies were written in a combination of Thuluth and either Naskh or Muhaqqaq. After the 15th century Naskh came to be used exclusively.\n\nThe script is used in the Flag of Saudi Arabia where its text, Shahada al Tawhid, is written in Thuluth.\n\nStyle\n\nAn important aspect of Thuluth script is the use of harakat (\"hareke\" in Turkish) to represent vowel sounds and of certain other stylistic marks to beautify the script. The rules governing the former are similar to the rules for any Arabic script. The stylistic marks have their own rules regarding placement and grouping which allow for great creativity as to shape and orientation. For example, one grouping technique is to separate the marks written below letters from those written above.\n\nScripts developed from Thuluth\n\nSince its creation, Thuluth has given rise to a variety of scripts used in calligraphy and over time has allowed numerous modifications. Jeli Thuluth was developed for use in large panels, such as those on tombstones. Muhaqqaq script was developed by widening the horizontal sections of the letters in Thuluth. Naskh script introduced a number of modifications resulting in smaller size and greater delicacy. Tevki is a smaller version of Thuluth .\n\nRuq'ah was probably derived from the Thuluth and Naskh styles, the latter itself having originated from Thuluth.\nQuestion:\nThe script of Thuluth, a variety of Islamic calligraphy, is seen on the flag of what country?\nAnswer:\nSaudia Arabia\nPassage:\nAmazon - definition of Amazon by The Free Dictionary\nAmazon - definition of Amazon by The Free Dictionary\nAmazon - definition of Amazon by The Free Dictionary\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/Amazon\n\u00a0(\u0103m\u2032\u0259-z\u014fn\u2032, -z\u0259n)\nn.\n1.

This folk etymology, like most folk etymologies, is incorrect, but the Amazons of legend are not so completely different from the historical Amazons, who were also warriors. The historical Amazons were Scythians, an Iranian people renowned for their cavalry. The first Greeks to come into contact with the Iranians were the Ionians, who lived on the coast of Asia Minor and were constantly threatened by the Persians, the most important of the Iranian peoples. Amaz\u014dn is the Ionian Greek form of the Iranian word ha-mazan, \"fighting together.\" The regular Greek form would be hamaz\u014dn, but because the Ionians dropped their aitches like Cockneys, hamaz\u014dn became amaz\u014dn, the form taken into the other Greek dialects.\namazon\n(\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n)\nn\n(Animals) any of various tropical American parrots of the genus Amazona, such as A. farinosa (green amazon), having a short tail and mainly green plumage\nAmazon\n(\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n)\nn\n1.

People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day.\nIn a typical sleep cycle , we initially enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep . For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis -- which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can become apparent at any age. In many cases, narcolepsy is undiagnosed and, therefore, untreated.\nWhat Causes Narcolepsy?\nThe cause of narcolepsy is not known; however, scientists have made progress toward identifying genes strongly associated with the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in the brain that may signal sleep and awake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may be due to a deficiency in the production of a chemical called hypocretin by the brain . In addition, researchers have discovered abnormalities in various parts of the brain involved in regulating REM sleep . These abnormalities apparently contribute to symptom development. According to experts, it is likely narcolepsy involves multiple factors that interact to cause neurological dysfunction and REM sleep disturbances.\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Narcolepsy?\nSymptoms of narcolepsy include:\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS): In general, EDS interferes with normal activities on a daily basis, whether or not a person with narcolepsy has sufficient sleep at night. People with EDS report mental cloudiness, a lack of energy and concentration, memory lapses, a depressed mood, and/or extreme exhaustion.\nCataplexy: This symptom consists of a sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to feelings of weakness and a loss of voluntary muscle control. It can cause symptoms ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved, and is often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger.\nHallucinations : Usually, these delusional experiences are vivid and frequently frightening. The content is primarily visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations when accompanying sleep onset and hypnopompic hallucinations when they occur during awakening.\nSleep paralysis : This symptom involves the temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes are generally brief, lasting a few seconds to several minutes. After episodes end, people rapidly recover their full capacity to move and speak.\nContinued\nHow Is Narcolepsy Diagnosed?\nA physical exam and exhaustive medical history are essential for proper diagnosis of narcolepsy. However, none of the major symptoms is exclusive to narcolepsy. Several specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic or sleep lab, usually are required before a diagnosis can be established. Two tests that are considered essential in confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy are the polysomnogram (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).\nThe PSG is an overnight test that takes continuous multiple measurements while a patient is asleep to document abnormalities in the sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether REM sleep occurs at abnormal times in the sleep cycle and can eliminate the possibility that an individual's symptoms result from another condition.\nThe MSLT is performed during the day to measure a person's tendency to fall asleep and to determine whether isolated elements of REM sleep intrude at inappropriate times during the waking hours. As part of the test, an individual is asked to take four or five short naps usually scheduled two hours apart.\nHow Is Narcolepsy Treated?\nAlthough there is no cure for narcolepsy, the most disabling symptoms of the disorder (EDS and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep, such as cataplexy) can be controlled in most people with drug treatment. Sleepiness is treated with amphetamine -like stimulants, while the symptoms of abnormal REM sleep are treated with antidepressant drugs.\nThere has recently been a new medication approved for those who suffer from narcolepsy with cataplexy. This drug, called Xyrem , helps people with narcolepsy get a better night's sleep, allowing them to be less sleepy during the day. Patients with narcolepsy can be substantially helped -- but not cured -- by medical treatment.\nLifestyle adjustments such as avoiding caffeine , alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals, regulating sleep schedules, scheduling daytime naps (10-15 minutes in length), and establishing a normal exercise and meal schedule may also help to reduce symptoms.\nWebMD Medical Reference Reviewed by Varnada  Karriem-Norwood, MD on August 28, 2014\nSources\nQuestion:\nWhat is the medical condition in which a person has an extreme tendency to fall asleep at inappropriate times?\nAnswer:\nNarcelepsy\nPassage:\nLouis XIV - World history\nLouis XIV\nLouis XIV\n1638 - 1715\nFrench King\nLouis XIV was called the Grand Monarch or Sun King.  His 72-year reign was the longest in modern European history.\nLouis was the son of Louis XIII, whom he succeeded at the age of five. During his childhood France was ruled by his mother, and her chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin. In 1660 Louis married Maria Theresa, the daughter of Philip IV of Spain.\nIn 1661 he assumed sole responsibility for government. He initiated an aggressive foreign, particularly against the Dutch; but his major political rivals were the Austrian Habsburgs. From 1665 Louis tried to take  possession of the Spanish Netherlands, but later tried to acquire the whole Spanish inheritance, which led to the War of the Spanish Sucession .\nLouis XIV brought France to its peak of absolute power and his words  'L'etat c'est moi' ('I am the state') express the spirit of a rule in  which the king held all political authority. His absolutism brought him into conflict with the Huguenots and the papacy, with damaging repercussions.\nHis many foreign wars became a financial burden, yet his long reign is associated  with the greatest age of French culture, symbolized by the Palace of Versailles.\nwww link :\nQuestion:\nGive a year in the life of King Louis XIV, the Sun King.\nAnswer:\n1638-1715\nPassage:\nClarified butter\nClarified butter is milk fat rendered from butter to separate the milk solids and water from the butterfat.  Typically, it is produced by melting butter and allowing the components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float to the surface and are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat (which would then be on top) is poured off.\n\nCommercial methods of production also include direct evaporation, but may also be accomplished by decantation and centrifugation followed by vacuum drying; or direct from cream by breaking the emulsion followed by centrifugation.  \n\nProperties\n\nClarified butter has a higher smoke point (485 \u00b0F or 252\u00a0\u00b0C) than regular butter (325-375 \u00b0F or 163-190\u00a0\u00b0C),  and is therefore preferred in some cooking applications, such as saut\u00e9ing. Clarified butter also has a much longer shelf life than fresh butter. It has negligible amounts of lactose and casein and is, therefore, acceptable to most who have a lactose intolerance or milk allergy. \n\nRegional variations\n\nIn South Asian cuisine and Arab cuisine, clarified butter (ghee) may be cooked long enough to evaporate the water portion and caramelize the milk solids (which are then filtered out), resulting in a nutty flavor.\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the cooked and clarified butter, much used in Indian cuisine?\nAnswer:\nGHEE\nPassage:\nHablot Knight Browne\nHablot Knight Browne (10 July 1815 \u2013 8 July 1882) was an English artist.  Well-known by his pen name, Phiz, he illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth.\n\nBiography\n\nOf Huguenot ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne's fifteen children. According to Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens' world says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition and 15 June 1815 (Dictionary of National Biography). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \n\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned his family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to Philadelphia where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine. \nThomas Moxon, husband of William's sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\n\nBrowne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of John Gilpin, he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\n\nArtistic career\n\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  Pickwick. Browne had been the illustrator of his little pamphlet Sunday under Three Heads. In the original edition of Pickwick, issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by Robert Seymour,  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by Robert William Buss.\n\nBrowne and William Makepeace Thackeray visited the publishers' office with specimens of their work for Dickens's inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed \"Nemo,\" but the third was signed \"Phiz,\" a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from \"Nemo\" to \"Phiz\" was made to harmonize better with Dickens's \"Boz.\"\n\nPhiz developed the character Sam Weller graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator's work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\n\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Browne made several drawings for Punch in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to Punch's Pocket Books.\n\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne). He also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth's and Frank Smedley's novels. Mervyn Clitheroe by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist's works. Browne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the Royal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\n\nMost of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\n\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Phiz-Sarony- 1870s.jpg|Browne photographed by Sarony c.1870s\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque, Ladbroke Grove, London\nFile:Phiz Auriol.jpg|Scene from Auriol by Harrison Ainsworth, 1844\nFile:Pelham.jpg|Frontispiece to Pelham by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1849\nQuestion:\nWhat was the pen name of the illustrator Hablot Knight-Brown?\nAnswer:\nHablot Knight Browne\nPassage:\nMermaid Theatre\nThe Mermaid Theatre was a theatre encompassing the site of Puddle Dock and Curriers' Alley  at Blackfriars in the City of London, and the most recently built in the City since the time of Shakespeare. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.\n\nHistory\n\nThe 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor Bernard Miles with his wife, Josephine Wilson. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the St. John's Wood area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of Dido and Aeneas with Kirsten Flagstad, Maggie Teyte and Thomas Hemsley, conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the Royal Exchange. \n\nMiles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the Jacobean era, to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by Philip Rosseter with distant backing from Henslowe and Alleyn, was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.\n\nThe new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of Lock Up Your Daughters and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as Cowardy Custard (often cited as responsible for the revival of interest in No\u00ebl Coward's works) and including an annual staging of Treasure Island, with Miles reprising his role of Long John Silver, which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.\n\nIn July 1961 the poet and author Sylvia Plath read her poem \"Tulips\" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, Ted Hughes.\n\nOther notable productions include the 1978 premi\u00e8re of Whose Life Is It Anyway?, with Tom Conti and Rona Anderson. \n\nGomba Holdings, a property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family, which claimed to have interests in the Garrick and Duchess theatres as well as Wembley Stadium,  bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the Johnson Matthey bank collapse.    Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.\n\nMarc Sinden was appointed artistic director in 1993, opening the Bernard Miles Studio as a second performance area,  but left the next year.  Actor Roy Marsden and Vanessa Ford took over the running of the theatre for a few months prior to its eventual closure and the termination of the Shamji family's ownership.\n\nAfter a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, ordered the council to block the demolition. As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The BBC Concert Orchestra used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, Friday Night is Music Night that showcased musicians such as the violinist Nigel Kennedy and singer Josh Groban. In 2006, music duo Pet Shop Boys played a mid-length set accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled Concrete.\n\nLoss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans\n\nIn September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the Theatres Trust and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,  granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer \u00a36 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.  The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners are concerned that the entire building may be demolished.  John Levitt, former chairman of Save London\u2019s Theatres Campaign, which led the high profile battle to save the venue, branded the decision \u201ca tragedy\u201d and \u201csheer meanness\u201d.\nQuestion:\nAt which location in London is the Mermaid Theatre?\nAnswer:\nPuddle Dock\nPassage:\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in ...\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange\nEtymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames\n6\nThere is clearly a prefix in names like McDonald, McChrystal, O\u2019Brian, O\u2019Neal.\nWhat does this Mc- and O- prefix signify?

Built in Kunsan, South Korea in a factory equipped with sophisticated laser-guided robots, it was developed as a replacement for the Daewoo Nexia and styled in Italy by Italian I.DE.A Institute. Engineering was carried out and overseen by former Porsche engineer Ulrich Bez (later of Aston Martin) using experience Daewoo gained from manufacturing previous GM platforms. The name Nubira (\ub204\ube44\ub77c) is the command form of the Korean verb Nubida (\ub204\ube44\ub2e4), meaning to crisscross.  Thus the name was chosen to convey the aspiration that this car would be seen crisscrossing every corner of the globe.\n\nThe Nubira II (J150) was released for model year 2000. Over 90 improvements were made by Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in the United Kingdom, including an increase in passenger space and a decrease in noise, harshness and vibration (by adding a fourth engine mount and retuning the intake resonators for example). Offset crash performance was further improved in the second generation, as demonstrated by Australian ANCAP tests, though it fell well short of exemplary performance. The exterior was reworked, creating a more dynamic upright and swept look of the era, a design later seen reflected by the Lexus ES350 and 2004 Mitsubishi Diamante.\n\nIn the United States, the Nubira was marketed with Daewoo's smaller subcompact Lanos and midsize Leganza. Daewoo had a difficult time entering the US auto market due to financial trouble at home; with 2002 being the last model year available due to bankruptcy and a lack of new product. In North America, the cars are relatively obscure, if not rare, and sourcing parts for them became relatively difficult; though many powertrain parts were shared worldwide with other GM platforms (Opel, Holden, Isuzu). \n\nBuyers could opt for either the base SE models, (mid range SX only available for 1999) or the premium CDX with standard features such as ABS, heated mirrors, cruise control, in-dash CD player and optional leather seating and power sunroof.\n\nUnited States Nubira models came equipped only with an Australian built Holden produced DOHC 16-valve 2.0-liter inline-4 General Motors \"D-Tec\" gasoline engine paired with either a Daewoo-designed D-20 five-speed manual transaxle or optional GM sourced 4T40E auto. Producing 136 lbft torque at 4,400\u00a0rpm, the GM Family-II engine had a square 3.4\" stroke and a 3.4\" bore and at 5,400\u00a0rpm making 129 bhp. International market Nubiras had a choice of a Daewoo \"E-Tech\" 1.6, or Holden 1.8 or 2.0-litre inline-four gasoline engines: no diesel version was ever offered, although the Worthing Technical Centre installed Renault's F8 1.9-litre engine in a small number of test vehicles, under a development programme known as J151.\n\nThe Nubira was also briefly produced from CKD kits on Taganrog, Russia TagAZ factory; it was marketed as the Doninvest Orion by the Russian automaker Doninvest. Until 2008, Daewoo Nubira was produced in Romania in a former Daewoo factory which had the licence from GM Daewoo. The Daewoo Nubira was still produced in Egypt in 2008, in a former Daewoo factory which has the licence from GM Daewoo.\n\nThe Nubira was replaced in 2004 with the J200 Daewoo Lacetti Suzuki Forenza, under GMDAT management with a new Pininfarina-designed body offered as a sedan, station wagon, and Italdesign hatchback and sold in some European markets as the Chevrolet Nubira.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Daewoo Nubira 5door.jpg|Daewoo Nubira hatchback\nFile:1999 Daewoo Nubira (J100) SE sedan (2015-07-03) 02.jpg|1999 Daewoo Nubira sedan (Australia)\nFile:'00-'02 Daewoo Nubira Sedan.JPG|2000\u20132002 Daewoo Nubira sedan (Canada)\nFile:00-02 Daewoo Nubira wagon rear.jpg|2000\u20132002 Daewoo Nubira wagon (US)\nFile:Daweoo 2.0 L DOHC engine I4 engine.jpg|Daewoo Nubira 2.0 L engine (US)\nQuestion:\nWhich car company manufactured the Nubira\nAnswer:\nTaeu\nPassage:\nFiredamp\nFiredamp is flammable gas found in coal mines. It is the name given to a number of flammable gases, especially methane. It is particularly found in areas where the coal is bituminous. The gas accumulates in pockets in the coal and adjacent strata, and when they are penetrated, the release can trigger explosions. Historically, if such a pocket was highly pressurized, it was termed a \"bag of foulness\". \n\nName \n\nDamps is the collective name given to all gases (other than air) found in coal mines in England. The word corresponds to German Dampf, the  name for \"vapour\".  \n\nAlongside firedamp, other damps include blackdamp (carbon dioxide and other gases), poisonous, explosive stinkdamp (hydrogen sulphide), with its characteristic \"rotten egg\" odour, and the insidiously lethal afterdamp (carbon monoxide and other gases)  produced following explosions of firedamp or coal dust.\n\nContribution to mine deaths\n\nFiredamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most explosions occurring at around 10%. It caused much loss of life in coal mines before the invention of the Geordie lamp and Davy lamp. The invention was prompted by the Felling mine disaster near Newcastle upon Tyne claiming 92 lives on 25 May 1812. Davy experimented with iron gauze, determining the maximum size of the gaps and the optimum wire thickness to prevent a flame passing through the gauze. If a naked flame was thus enclosed totally by such a gauze, then methane could pass into the lamp and burn safely above the flame. He did not patent his invention.\n\nEven after the safety lamps were brought into common use, firedamp explosions could still occur from sparks produced when coal contaminated with pyrites was struck with metal tools. The presence of coal dust in the air increased the risk of explosion with firedamp, and indeed could cause explosions itself.\n\nThe Tyneside coal mines in England had the deadly combination of bituminous coal contaminated with pyrites, and a great number of lives were lost in accidents due to firedamp explosions, including 102 dead at Wallsend in 1835. A continuous flame was produced at Whitehaven some time before 1733, described as being \"a yard wide and two yards long.\" The miners dealt with it by piping it to the outside. \n\nRather than the Davy lamp, Tyneside miners used the Geordie lamp, a similar safety lamp designed by George Stephenson. After the widespread introduction of the safety lamp, explosions continued because the early Davy lamps were fragile and easily damaged. The iron gauze for example only needed to lose one wire to become unsafe. The light was also very poor, and there were continuous attempts to improve the basic design. The height of the cone of burning methane in a flame safety lamp can be used to estimate the concentration of the gas in the local atmosphere. It was not until the 1890s that safe and reliable electric lamps became available in collieries.\nQuestion:\nWhich gas was once known as ' Fire Damp ' because it often caused explosions in mines ?\nAnswer:\nETHANE\nPassage:\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional ...\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional Dogs \u2013 Better Reading\nContact\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional Dogs\nIt\u2019s National Dog Day in Australia this Wednesday, 26th August.

Showcasing most of the major French or Belgian comics talents of its day the magazine introduced major series such as Ast\u00e9rix, Barbe-Rouge, Blueberry, Achille Talon, and Val\u00e9rian et Laureline.  Major comics writers like Ren\u00e9 Goscinny, Jean-Michel Charlier, Greg, Pierre Christin and Jacques Lob were featured in the magazine, as were artists such as Jij\u00e9, Morris, Albert Uderzo, Jean (M\u0153bius) Giraud, Enki Bilal, Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, Jacques Tardi, Philippe Druillet, Marcel Gotlib, Alexis, and Annie Goetzinger.\n\nPilote also published several international talents such as Hugo Pratt, Frank Bellamy and Robert Crumb.\n\nHistory\n\nFollowing the publication of a teaser issue number 0 on June 1, Pilote made its debut proper on October 29, 1959.  The magazine was started by experienced comics writers Goscinny and Charlier, and artists Albert Uderzo and Jean H\u00e9brard. Previously this team had worked together on several other projects, creating Le Suppl\u00e9ment Illustr\u00e9, a cartoon supplement for newspapers, and providing cartoons for Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9, a magazine published by Radio-Luxembourg.  Pilote was marketed by Radio-Luxembourg, and featured editorials written by popular radio personalities of the day. The 300,000 copies of the first issue sold out in one day.\n\nCharlier and Goscinny handled most of the initial writing. Although Charlier came up with two popular series, Tanguy et Laverdure with Albert Uderzo and Barbe-Rouge (Redbeard) with Victor Hubinon, it was Goscinny and Uderzo\u2019s Ast\u00e9rix le Gaulois which was the biggest hit and the magazine\u2019s initial mainstay.\n\nDifficulties\n\nFinancial problems arose in 1960, but were resolved when the magazine was bought out by Dargaud publishers. Dargaud expanded the magazine with several new series, including Charlier and Giraud\u2019s Blueberry and Greg's Achille Tallon in 1963.  In 1967 the popular science-fiction series Val\u00e9rian et Laureline debuted and in 1968 the popular Western comedy Lucky Luke (by Morris) was transferred to Pilote from Spirou magazine. Other notable appearances included series from the British comics magazine Eagle such as Fraser l'Africain (Fraser of Africa) and Winston Churchill by Frank Bellamy.\n\nAttempts were made in the 1970s to update the magazine with material of more interest to adults, but many artists like Druillet and Giraud felt Pilote was no longer the appropriate vehicle for their aspirations and left to found new magazines such as M\u00e9tal Hurlant (the French original that inspired Heavy Metal).  Partly as a result, Dargaud reduced Pilote\u2019s publication schedule from weekly to monthly in 1974, and Ren\u00e9 Goscinny was replaced as editor-in-chief. At this time, a new generation of artists also started publishing in Pilote, namely Caza, Lauzier, and F'Murr. Their comics reflected the new, more adult direction.\n\nSales initially improved but a steady erosion took place through the 1980s as interest in the medium declined. Pilote was merged with the comics magazine Charlie Mensuel in 1986 and continued as Pilote et Charlie until 1988, when the name was changed back to Pilote.  However, declining sales prompted Dargaud to suspend publication after what became the final issue on October 1, 1989. \n\nAfter 1989, there has been no regular publications of the magazine, although the name has been used for occasional oversized specials. \n\nMain authors and series\n\n* Alexis: Timol\u00e9on et Stanislas (1969\u20131973), Al Crane (1976\u20131977)\n* Philippe Bertrand: Linda aime l'art (1983\u20131989)\n* Enki Bilal: L\u00e9gendes d'Aujourd'hui (1976\u20131982), La foire aux immortels (1980)\n* Michel Blanc-Dumont: Jonathan Cartland (1974\u20131988)\n* Claire Bret\u00e9cher: Cellulite (1969\u20131977)\n* Cabu: Grand Duduche (1963\u20131982)\n* Caza: Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de banlieue (1975\u20131979)\n* Jean Chakir: S\u00e9raphin contre Angelure (1962\u20131970)\n* Delinx: Buck Gallo (1963\u20131969)\n* Jean-Michel Charlier: Blueberry (1963\u20131973), Barbe-Rouge (1959\u20131969), Tanguy et Laverdure (1959\u20131970)\n* Pierre Christin: Val\u00e9rian and Laureline (1967\u20131985), L\u00e9gendes d'Aujourd'hui (1976\u20131982)\n* Philippe Druillet: Lone Sloane (1970\u20131974)\n* F'Murr: Le G\u00e9nie des alpages (1973\u20131989)\n* Fred: Phil\u00e9mon (1965\u20131986)\n* Jean Giraud: Blueberry (1963\u20131973)\n* Christian Godard: Norbert et Kari (1963\u20131970), Vagabond des limbes (1978\u20131987)\n* Ren\u00e9 Goscinny: Asterix (1959\u20131973), Lucky Luke (1967\u20131973), Iznogoud (1968\u20131977), Petit Nicolas (1959\u20131965)\n* Marcel Gotlib: Dingodossiers (1965\u20131967), Rubrique-\u00e0-Brac (1968\u20131973)\n* Greg: Achille Talon (1963\u20131981)\n* Laurence Harl\u00e9: Jonathan Cartland (1974\u20131988) \n* Victor Hubinon: Barbe-Rouge (1959\u20131969)\n* Jij\u00e9: Tanguy et Laverdure (1966\u20131970)\n* Claude Lacroix: Homme au chapeau mou (1977\u20131983)\n* Lauzier: Tranche de Vie (1970\u20131978), Al Crane (1976\u20131977)\n* Jacques Lob: Submerman (1967\u20131970)\n* Nikita Mandryka: Concombre masqu\u00e9 (1971\u20131981), Clopinettes (1970\u20131973)\n* Martial: Tony Laflamme (1963\u20131971)\n* Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res: Val\u00e9rian and Laureline (1967\u20131985)\n* Morris: Lucky Luke (1967\u20131973)\n* Antonio Hernandez Palacios: Mac Coy (1974\u20131989)\n* Julio Ribera: Vagabond des limbes (1978\u20131987), Dracurella (1973\u20131982)\n* Jean Tabary: Iznogoud (1968\u20131977), Valentin le vagabond (1962\u20131974)\n* Fran\u00e7ois Thomas: Stan Ca\u00efman (1982\u20131989)\n* Albert Uderzo: Asterix (1959\u20131973), Tanguy et Laverdure (1959\u20131967)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the generic title of a series of French comic strips that first appeared in French in the magazine Pilote on 29 October 1959?\nAnswer:\nThe Mirror World Asterix exhibition\n\n\nPassage:\nHigh Willhays\nHigh Willhays or, according to some authors, High Willes  is the highest point on Dartmoor, Devon, at 621\u00a0metres (2,039\u00a0ft) above sea level,Dartmoor National Park Authority, [http://web.archive.org/web/20070808234510/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/lab-geninfo.pdf General Information: Dartmoor Factsheet], 2004, p.\u00a01 and the highest point in the United Kingdom south of the Brecon Beacons.\n\nToponymy\n\nIn 1912, William Crossing, writer and documenter, said that the name High Willes had been thought to have derived from the word huel or wheal meaning mine, but he did not think that very likely as old mine workings were invariably located near to streams. He suggested instead that the name derived from gwylfa, a watching place, noting its similarity with Brown Willy, the name of the highest hill on nearby Bodmin Moor, and suggested that a watch for beacon fires used to be kept here.

However, the first topographical survey of the area carried out by Ordnance Survey suggested that High Willhays was twelve feet higher, although the difference has now been measured at just eight feet.

The straight angular forms of Kufic were replaced in the new script by curved and oblique lines. In Thuluth, one-third of each letter slopes, from which the name (meaning \"a third\" in Arabic) comes. An alternative theory to the meaning is that the smallest width of the letter is one third of the widest part. It is an elegant, cursive script, used in medieval times on mosque decorations. Various calligraphic styles evolved from Thuluth through slight changes of form.\n\nHistory\n\nThe greatest contributions to the evolution of the Thuluth script, occurred during Ottoman Empire in three successive steps that Ottoman Art Historians call \"calligraphical revolutions\":\n\n*The first revolution occurred in the 15th century and was initiated by the Master Calligrapher \u015eeyh Hamdullah.[http://www.kalemguzeli.net/huseyin-kutlu-hat-sanati-kalemi-sevk-edebilmektir.html H\u00fcseyin Kutlu: Hat sanat\u0131 kalemi \u015fevk edebilmektir - Kalem G\u00fczeli][http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00xcallig/mughalearly/zzturkey/hamdullah1500s.html hamdullah1500s]\n*The second revolution resulted from the work of the Ottoman calligrapher H\u00e2f\u0131z Osman in the 17th century.[http://www.istanbul.edu.tr/Bolumler/guzelsanat/kitap.htm Kitap Sanat\u0131] \n*Finally, in the late 19th century, Mehmed \u015eevk\u00ee Efendi gave the script the distinctive shape it has today.[http://sanattarihi.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/mehmed-sevki-efendi-2/ Mehmed \u015eevki Efendi \u00ab Sanat Tarihi] [http://www.turkislamsanatlari.com/sevkiefendi.asp T\u00fcrk \u00ddslam Sanatlar\u00fd - Tezyini Sanatlar]\n\nArtists\n\nThe best known artist to write the Thuluth script at its zenith is said to be Mustafa R\u00e2k\u0131m Efendi (1757\u20131826), a painter who set a standard in Ottoman calligraphy which many believe has not been surpassed to this day.[http://calligrapher.blogsome.com/2006/04/20/rakim-mustafa-rakim-1757-1826/ Journal of Ottoman Calligraphy :: RAKIM: \u201cMustafa Rakim\u201d (1757 - 1826) :: April :: 2006]\n\nUsage\n\nThuluth was used to write the headings of surahs, Qur'anic chapters. Some of the oldest copies of the Qur'an were written in Thuluth. Later copies were written in a combination of Thuluth and either Naskh or Muhaqqaq. After the 15th century Naskh came to be used exclusively.\n\nThe script is used in the Flag of Saudi Arabia where its text, Shahada al Tawhid, is written in Thuluth.\n\nStyle\n\nAn important aspect of Thuluth script is the use of harakat (\"hareke\" in Turkish) to represent vowel sounds and of certain other stylistic marks to beautify the script. The rules governing the former are similar to the rules for any Arabic script. The stylistic marks have their own rules regarding placement and grouping which allow for great creativity as to shape and orientation. For example, one grouping technique is to separate the marks written below letters from those written above.\n\nScripts developed from Thuluth\n\nSince its creation, Thuluth has given rise to a variety of scripts used in calligraphy and over time has allowed numerous modifications. Jeli Thuluth was developed for use in large panels, such as those on tombstones. Muhaqqaq script was developed by widening the horizontal sections of the letters in Thuluth.

Their name is supposedly derived from Greek a-mazos, \"without a breast,\" because according to the legend they cut off their right breasts so as to be better able to shoot with a bow and arrow. This folk etymology, like most folk etymologies, is incorrect, but the Amazons of legend are not so completely different from the historical Amazons, who were also warriors. The historical Amazons were Scythians, an Iranian people renowned for their cavalry. The first Greeks to come into contact with the Iranians were the Ionians, who lived on the coast of Asia Minor and were constantly threatened by the Persians, the most important of the Iranian peoples. Amaz\u014dn is the Ionian Greek form of the Iranian word ha-mazan, \"fighting together.\" The regular Greek form would be hamaz\u014dn, but because the Ionians dropped their aitches like Cockneys, hamaz\u014dn became amaz\u014dn, the form taken into the other Greek dialects.\namazon\n(\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n)\nn\n(Animals) any of various tropical American parrots of the genus Amazona, such as A. farinosa (green amazon), having a short tail and mainly green plumage\nAmazon\n(\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n)\nn\n1.

People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day.\nIn a typical sleep cycle , we initially enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep . For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis -- which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can become apparent at any age. In many cases, narcolepsy is undiagnosed and, therefore, untreated.\nWhat Causes Narcolepsy?\nThe cause of narcolepsy is not known; however, scientists have made progress toward identifying genes strongly associated with the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in the brain that may signal sleep and awake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may be due to a deficiency in the production of a chemical called hypocretin by the brain . In addition, researchers have discovered abnormalities in various parts of the brain involved in regulating REM sleep . These abnormalities apparently contribute to symptom development. According to experts, it is likely narcolepsy involves multiple factors that interact to cause neurological dysfunction and REM sleep disturbances.\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Narcolepsy?\nSymptoms of narcolepsy include:\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS): In general, EDS interferes with normal activities on a daily basis, whether or not a person with narcolepsy has sufficient sleep at night. People with EDS report mental cloudiness, a lack of energy and concentration, memory lapses, a depressed mood, and/or extreme exhaustion.\nCataplexy: This symptom consists of a sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to feelings of weakness and a loss of voluntary muscle control. It can cause symptoms ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved, and is often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger.\nHallucinations : Usually, these delusional experiences are vivid and frequently frightening. The content is primarily visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations when accompanying sleep onset and hypnopompic hallucinations when they occur during awakening.\nSleep paralysis : This symptom involves the temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes are generally brief, lasting a few seconds to several minutes. After episodes end, people rapidly recover their full capacity to move and speak.\nContinued\nHow Is Narcolepsy Diagnosed?\nA physical exam and exhaustive medical history are essential for proper diagnosis of narcolepsy. However, none of the major symptoms is exclusive to narcolepsy. Several specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic or sleep lab, usually are required before a diagnosis can be established. Two tests that are considered essential in confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy are the polysomnogram (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).\nThe PSG is an overnight test that takes continuous multiple measurements while a patient is asleep to document abnormalities in the sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether REM sleep occurs at abnormal times in the sleep cycle and can eliminate the possibility that an individual's symptoms result from another condition.\nThe MSLT is performed during the day to measure a person's tendency to fall asleep and to determine whether isolated elements of REM sleep intrude at inappropriate times during the waking hours. As part of the test, an individual is asked to take four or five short naps usually scheduled two hours apart.\nHow Is Narcolepsy Treated?\nAlthough there is no cure for narcolepsy, the most disabling symptoms of the disorder (EDS and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep, such as cataplexy) can be controlled in most people with drug treatment. Sleepiness is treated with amphetamine -like stimulants, while the symptoms of abnormal REM sleep are treated with antidepressant drugs.\nThere has recently been a new medication approved for those who suffer from narcolepsy with cataplexy. This drug, called Xyrem , helps people with narcolepsy get a better night's sleep, allowing them to be less sleepy during the day. Patients with narcolepsy can be substantially helped -- but not cured -- by medical treatment.\nLifestyle adjustments such as avoiding caffeine , alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals, regulating sleep schedules, scheduling daytime naps (10-15 minutes in length), and establishing a normal exercise and meal schedule may also help to reduce symptoms.\nWebMD Medical Reference Reviewed by Varnada  Karriem-Norwood, MD on August 28, 2014\nSources\nQuestion:\nWhat is the medical condition in which a person has an extreme tendency to fall asleep at inappropriate times?\nAnswer:\nNarcelepsy\nPassage:\nLouis XIV - World history\nLouis XIV\nLouis XIV\n1638 - 1715\nFrench King\nLouis XIV was called the Grand Monarch or Sun King.  His 72-year reign was the longest in modern European history.\nLouis was the son of Louis XIII, whom he succeeded at the age of five. During his childhood France was ruled by his mother, and her chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin. In 1660 Louis married Maria Theresa, the daughter of Philip IV of Spain.\nIn 1661 he assumed sole responsibility for government. He initiated an aggressive foreign, particularly against the Dutch; but his major political rivals were the Austrian Habsburgs. From 1665 Louis tried to take  possession of the Spanish Netherlands, but later tried to acquire the whole Spanish inheritance, which led to the War of the Spanish Sucession .\nLouis XIV brought France to its peak of absolute power and his words  'L'etat c'est moi' ('I am the state') express the spirit of a rule in  which the king held all political authority. His absolutism brought him into conflict with the Huguenots and the papacy, with damaging repercussions.\nHis many foreign wars became a financial burden, yet his long reign is associated  with the greatest age of French culture, symbolized by the Palace of Versailles.\nwww link :\nQuestion:\nGive a year in the life of King Louis XIV, the Sun King.\nAnswer:\n1638-1715\nPassage:\nClarified butter\nClarified butter is milk fat rendered from butter to separate the milk solids and water from the butterfat.  Typically, it is produced by melting butter and allowing the components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float to the surface and are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat (which would then be on top) is poured off.\n\nCommercial methods of production also include direct evaporation, but may also be accomplished by decantation and centrifugation followed by vacuum drying; or direct from cream by breaking the emulsion followed by centrifugation.  \n\nProperties\n\nClarified butter has a higher smoke point (485 \u00b0F or 252\u00a0\u00b0C) than regular butter (325-375 \u00b0F or 163-190\u00a0\u00b0C),  and is therefore preferred in some cooking applications, such as saut\u00e9ing. Clarified butter also has a much longer shelf life than fresh butter. It has negligible amounts of lactose and casein and is, therefore, acceptable to most who have a lactose intolerance or milk allergy. \n\nRegional variations\n\nIn South Asian cuisine and Arab cuisine, clarified butter (ghee) may be cooked long enough to evaporate the water portion and caramelize the milk solids (which are then filtered out), resulting in a nutty flavor.\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the cooked and clarified butter, much used in Indian cuisine?\nAnswer:\nGHEE\nPassage:\nHablot Knight Browne\nHablot Knight Browne (10 July 1815 \u2013 8 July 1882) was an English artist.  Well-known by his pen name, Phiz, he illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth.\n\nBiography\n\nOf Huguenot ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne's fifteen children. According to Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens' world says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition and 15 June 1815 (Dictionary of National Biography). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \n\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned his family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to Philadelphia where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine. \nThomas Moxon, husband of William's sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\n\nBrowne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of John Gilpin, he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\n\nArtistic career\n\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  Pickwick. Browne had been the illustrator of his little pamphlet Sunday under Three Heads. In the original edition of Pickwick, issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by Robert Seymour,  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by Robert William Buss.\n\nBrowne and William Makepeace Thackeray visited the publishers' office with specimens of their work for Dickens's inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed \"Nemo,\" but the third was signed \"Phiz,\" a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from \"Nemo\" to \"Phiz\" was made to harmonize better with Dickens's \"Boz.\"\n\nPhiz developed the character Sam Weller graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator's work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\n\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Browne made several drawings for Punch in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to Punch's Pocket Books.\n\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne). He also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth's and Frank Smedley's novels. Mervyn Clitheroe by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist's works. Browne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the Royal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\n\nMost of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\n\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Phiz-Sarony- 1870s.jpg|Browne photographed by Sarony c.1870s\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque, Ladbroke Grove, London\nFile:Phiz Auriol.jpg|Scene from Auriol by Harrison Ainsworth, 1844\nFile:Pelham.jpg|Frontispiece to Pelham by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1849\nQuestion:\nWhat was the pen name of the illustrator Hablot Knight-Brown?\nAnswer:\nHablot Knight Browne\nPassage:\nMermaid Theatre\nThe Mermaid Theatre was a theatre encompassing the site of Puddle Dock and Curriers' Alley  at Blackfriars in the City of London, and the most recently built in the City since the time of Shakespeare. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.\n\nHistory\n\nThe 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor Bernard Miles with his wife, Josephine Wilson. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the St. John's Wood area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of Dido and Aeneas with Kirsten Flagstad, Maggie Teyte and Thomas Hemsley, conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the Royal Exchange. \n\nMiles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the Jacobean era, to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by Philip Rosseter with distant backing from Henslowe and Alleyn, was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.\n\nThe new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of Lock Up Your Daughters and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as Cowardy Custard (often cited as responsible for the revival of interest in No\u00ebl Coward's works) and including an annual staging of Treasure Island, with Miles reprising his role of Long John Silver, which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.\n\nIn July 1961 the poet and author Sylvia Plath read her poem \"Tulips\" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, Ted Hughes.\n\nOther notable productions include the 1978 premi\u00e8re of Whose Life Is It Anyway?, with Tom Conti and Rona Anderson. \n\nGomba Holdings, a property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family, which claimed to have interests in the Garrick and Duchess theatres as well as Wembley Stadium,  bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the Johnson Matthey bank collapse.    Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.\n\nMarc Sinden was appointed artistic director in 1993, opening the Bernard Miles Studio as a second performance area,  but left the next year.  Actor Roy Marsden and Vanessa Ford took over the running of the theatre for a few months prior to its eventual closure and the termination of the Shamji family's ownership.\n\nAfter a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, ordered the council to block the demolition. As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The BBC Concert Orchestra used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, Friday Night is Music Night that showcased musicians such as the violinist Nigel Kennedy and singer Josh Groban. In 2006, music duo Pet Shop Boys played a mid-length set accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled Concrete.\n\nLoss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans\n\nIn September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the Theatres Trust and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,  granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer \u00a36 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.  The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners are concerned that the entire building may be demolished.  John Levitt, former chairman of Save London\u2019s Theatres Campaign, which led the high profile battle to save the venue, branded the decision \u201ca tragedy\u201d and \u201csheer meanness\u201d.\nQuestion:\nAt which location in London is the Mermaid Theatre?\nAnswer:\nPuddle Dock\nPassage:\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in ...\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange\nEtymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames\n6\nThere is clearly a prefix in names like McDonald, McChrystal, O\u2019Brian, O\u2019Neal.\nWhat does this Mc- and O- prefix signify?

Built in Kunsan, South Korea in a factory equipped with sophisticated laser-guided robots, it was developed as a replacement for the Daewoo Nexia and styled in Italy by Italian I.DE.A Institute. Engineering was carried out and overseen by former Porsche engineer Ulrich Bez (later of Aston Martin) using experience Daewoo gained from manufacturing previous GM platforms. The name Nubira (\ub204\ube44\ub77c) is the command form of the Korean verb Nubida (\ub204\ube44\ub2e4), meaning to crisscross.  Thus the name was chosen to convey the aspiration that this car would be seen crisscrossing every corner of the globe.\n\nThe Nubira II (J150) was released for model year 2000. Over 90 improvements were made by Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in the United Kingdom, including an increase in passenger space and a decrease in noise, harshness and vibration (by adding a fourth engine mount and retuning the intake resonators for example). Offset crash performance was further improved in the second generation, as demonstrated by Australian ANCAP tests, though it fell well short of exemplary performance. The exterior was reworked, creating a more dynamic upright and swept look of the era, a design later seen reflected by the Lexus ES350 and 2004 Mitsubishi Diamante.\n\nIn the United States, the Nubira was marketed with Daewoo's smaller subcompact Lanos and midsize Leganza. Daewoo had a difficult time entering the US auto market due to financial trouble at home; with 2002 being the last model year available due to bankruptcy and a lack of new product. In North America, the cars are relatively obscure, if not rare, and sourcing parts for them became relatively difficult; though many powertrain parts were shared worldwide with other GM platforms (Opel, Holden, Isuzu). \n\nBuyers could opt for either the base SE models, (mid range SX only available for 1999) or the premium CDX with standard features such as ABS, heated mirrors, cruise control, in-dash CD player and optional leather seating and power sunroof.\n\nUnited States Nubira models came equipped only with an Australian built Holden produced DOHC 16-valve 2.0-liter inline-4 General Motors \"D-Tec\" gasoline engine paired with either a Daewoo-designed D-20 five-speed manual transaxle or optional GM sourced 4T40E auto. Producing 136 lbft torque at 4,400\u00a0rpm, the GM Family-II engine had a square 3.4\" stroke and a 3.4\" bore and at 5,400\u00a0rpm making 129 bhp. International market Nubiras had a choice of a Daewoo \"E-Tech\" 1.6, or Holden 1.8 or 2.0-litre inline-four gasoline engines: no diesel version was ever offered, although the Worthing Technical Centre installed Renault's F8 1.9-litre engine in a small number of test vehicles, under a development programme known as J151.\n\nThe Nubira was also briefly produced from CKD kits on Taganrog, Russia TagAZ factory; it was marketed as the Doninvest Orion by the Russian automaker Doninvest. Until 2008, Daewoo Nubira was produced in Romania in a former Daewoo factory which had the licence from GM Daewoo. The Daewoo Nubira was still produced in Egypt in 2008, in a former Daewoo factory which has the licence from GM Daewoo.\n\nThe Nubira was replaced in 2004 with the J200 Daewoo Lacetti Suzuki Forenza, under GMDAT management with a new Pininfarina-designed body offered as a sedan, station wagon, and Italdesign hatchback and sold in some European markets as the Chevrolet Nubira.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Daewoo Nubira 5door.jpg|Daewoo Nubira hatchback\nFile:1999 Daewoo Nubira (J100) SE sedan (2015-07-03) 02.jpg|1999 Daewoo Nubira sedan (Australia)\nFile:'00-'02 Daewoo Nubira Sedan.JPG|2000\u20132002 Daewoo Nubira sedan (Canada)\nFile:00-02 Daewoo Nubira wagon rear.jpg|2000\u20132002 Daewoo Nubira wagon (US)\nFile:Daweoo 2.0 L DOHC engine I4 engine.jpg|Daewoo Nubira 2.0 L engine (US)\nQuestion:\nWhich car company manufactured the Nubira\nAnswer:\nTaeu\nPassage:\nFiredamp\nFiredamp is flammable gas found in coal mines.

Historically, if such a pocket was highly pressurized, it was termed a \"bag of foulness\". \n\nName \n\nDamps is the collective name given to all gases (other than air) found in coal mines in England. The word corresponds to German Dampf, the  name for \"vapour\".  \n\nAlongside firedamp, other damps include blackdamp (carbon dioxide and other gases), poisonous, explosive stinkdamp (hydrogen sulphide), with its characteristic \"rotten egg\" odour, and the insidiously lethal afterdamp (carbon monoxide and other gases)  produced following explosions of firedamp or coal dust.\n\nContribution to mine deaths\n\nFiredamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most explosions occurring at around 10%. It caused much loss of life in coal mines before the invention of the Geordie lamp and Davy lamp. The invention was prompted by the Felling mine disaster near Newcastle upon Tyne claiming 92 lives on 25 May 1812. Davy experimented with iron gauze, determining the maximum size of the gaps and the optimum wire thickness to prevent a flame passing through the gauze. If a naked flame was thus enclosed totally by such a gauze, then methane could pass into the lamp and burn safely above the flame. He did not patent his invention.\n\nEven after the safety lamps were brought into common use, firedamp explosions could still occur from sparks produced when coal contaminated with pyrites was struck with metal tools. The presence of coal dust in the air increased the risk of explosion with firedamp, and indeed could cause explosions itself.\n\nThe Tyneside coal mines in England had the deadly combination of bituminous coal contaminated with pyrites, and a great number of lives were lost in accidents due to firedamp explosions, including 102 dead at Wallsend in 1835. A continuous flame was produced at Whitehaven some time before 1733, described as being \"a yard wide and two yards long.\" The miners dealt with it by piping it to the outside. \n\nRather than the Davy lamp, Tyneside miners used the Geordie lamp, a similar safety lamp designed by George Stephenson. After the widespread introduction of the safety lamp, explosions continued because the early Davy lamps were fragile and easily damaged. The iron gauze for example only needed to lose one wire to become unsafe. The light was also very poor, and there were continuous attempts to improve the basic design. The height of the cone of burning methane in a flame safety lamp can be used to estimate the concentration of the gas in the local atmosphere. It was not until the 1890s that safe and reliable electric lamps became available in collieries.\nQuestion:\nWhich gas was once known as ' Fire Damp ' because it often caused explosions in mines ?\nAnswer:\nETHANE\nPassage:\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional ...\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional Dogs \u2013 Better Reading\nContact\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional Dogs\nIt\u2019s National Dog Day in Australia this Wednesday, 26th August.

Showcasing most of the major French or Belgian comics talents of its day the magazine introduced major series such as Ast\u00e9rix, Barbe-Rouge, Blueberry, Achille Talon, and Val\u00e9rian et Laureline.  Major comics writers like Ren\u00e9 Goscinny, Jean-Michel Charlier, Greg, Pierre Christin and Jacques Lob were featured in the magazine, as were artists such as Jij\u00e9, Morris, Albert Uderzo, Jean (M\u0153bius) Giraud, Enki Bilal, Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, Jacques Tardi, Philippe Druillet, Marcel Gotlib, Alexis, and Annie Goetzinger.\n\nPilote also published several international talents such as Hugo Pratt, Frank Bellamy and Robert Crumb.\n\nHistory\n\nFollowing the publication of a teaser issue number 0 on June 1, Pilote made its debut proper on October 29, 1959.  The magazine was started by experienced comics writers Goscinny and Charlier, and artists Albert Uderzo and Jean H\u00e9brard. Previously this team had worked together on several other projects, creating Le Suppl\u00e9ment Illustr\u00e9, a cartoon supplement for newspapers, and providing cartoons for Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9, a magazine published by Radio-Luxembourg.  Pilote was marketed by Radio-Luxembourg, and featured editorials written by popular radio personalities of the day. The 300,000 copies of the first issue sold out in one day.\n\nCharlier and Goscinny handled most of the initial writing. Although Charlier came up with two popular series, Tanguy et Laverdure with Albert Uderzo and Barbe-Rouge (Redbeard) with Victor Hubinon, it was Goscinny and Uderzo\u2019s Ast\u00e9rix le Gaulois which was the biggest hit and the magazine\u2019s initial mainstay.\n\nDifficulties\n\nFinancial problems arose in 1960, but were resolved when the magazine was bought out by Dargaud publishers. Dargaud expanded the magazine with several new series, including Charlier and Giraud\u2019s Blueberry and Greg's Achille Tallon in 1963.  In 1967 the popular science-fiction series Val\u00e9rian et Laureline debuted and in 1968 the popular Western comedy Lucky Luke (by Morris) was transferred to Pilote from Spirou magazine. Other notable appearances included series from the British comics magazine Eagle such as Fraser l'Africain (Fraser of Africa) and Winston Churchill by Frank Bellamy.\n\nAttempts were made in the 1970s to update the magazine with material of more interest to adults, but many artists like Druillet and Giraud felt Pilote was no longer the appropriate vehicle for their aspirations and left to found new magazines such as M\u00e9tal Hurlant (the French original that inspired Heavy Metal).  Partly as a result, Dargaud reduced Pilote\u2019s publication schedule from weekly to monthly in 1974, and Ren\u00e9 Goscinny was replaced as editor-in-chief. At this time, a new generation of artists also started publishing in Pilote, namely Caza, Lauzier, and F'Murr. Their comics reflected the new, more adult direction.\n\nSales initially improved but a steady erosion took place through the 1980s as interest in the medium declined. Pilote was merged with the comics magazine Charlie Mensuel in 1986 and continued as Pilote et Charlie until 1988, when the name was changed back to Pilote.  However, declining sales prompted Dargaud to suspend publication after what became the final issue on October 1, 1989. \n\nAfter 1989, there has been no regular publications of the magazine, although the name has been used for occasional oversized specials. \n\nMain authors and series\n\n* Alexis: Timol\u00e9on et Stanislas (1969\u20131973), Al Crane (1976\u20131977)\n* Philippe Bertrand: Linda aime l'art (1983\u20131989)\n* Enki Bilal: L\u00e9gendes d'Aujourd'hui (1976\u20131982), La foire aux immortels (1980)\n* Michel Blanc-Dumont: Jonathan Cartland (1974\u20131988)\n* Claire Bret\u00e9cher: Cellulite (1969\u20131977)\n* Cabu: Grand Duduche (1963\u20131982)\n* Caza: Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de banlieue (1975\u20131979)\n* Jean Chakir: S\u00e9raphin contre Angelure (1962\u20131970)\n* Delinx: Buck Gallo (1963\u20131969)\n* Jean-Michel Charlier: Blueberry (1963\u20131973), Barbe-Rouge (1959\u20131969), Tanguy et Laverdure (1959\u20131970)\n* Pierre Christin: Val\u00e9rian and Laureline (1967\u20131985), L\u00e9gendes d'Aujourd'hui (1976\u20131982)\n* Philippe Druillet: Lone Sloane (1970\u20131974)\n* F'Murr: Le G\u00e9nie des alpages (1973\u20131989)\n* Fred: Phil\u00e9mon (1965\u20131986)\n* Jean Giraud: Blueberry (1963\u20131973)\n* Christian Godard: Norbert et Kari (1963\u20131970), Vagabond des limbes (1978\u20131987)\n* Ren\u00e9 Goscinny: Asterix (1959\u20131973), Lucky Luke (1967\u20131973), Iznogoud (1968\u20131977), Petit Nicolas (1959\u20131965)\n* Marcel Gotlib: Dingodossiers (1965\u20131967), Rubrique-\u00e0-Brac (1968\u20131973)\n* Greg: Achille Talon (1963\u20131981)\n* Laurence Harl\u00e9: Jonathan Cartland (1974\u20131988) \n* Victor Hubinon: Barbe-Rouge (1959\u20131969)\n* Jij\u00e9: Tanguy et Laverdure (1966\u20131970)\n* Claude Lacroix: Homme au chapeau mou (1977\u20131983)\n* Lauzier: Tranche de Vie (1970\u20131978), Al Crane (1976\u20131977)\n* Jacques Lob: Submerman (1967\u20131970)\n* Nikita Mandryka: Concombre masqu\u00e9 (1971\u20131981), Clopinettes (1970\u20131973)\n* Martial: Tony Laflamme (1963\u20131971)\n* Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res: Val\u00e9rian and Laureline (1967\u20131985)\n* Morris: Lucky Luke (1967\u20131973)\n* Antonio Hernandez Palacios: Mac Coy (1974\u20131989)\n* Julio Ribera: Vagabond des limbes (1978\u20131987), Dracurella (1973\u20131982)\n* Jean Tabary: Iznogoud (1968\u20131977), Valentin le vagabond (1962\u20131974)\n* Fran\u00e7ois Thomas: Stan Ca\u00efman (1982\u20131989)\n* Albert Uderzo: Asterix (1959\u20131973), Tanguy et Laverdure (1959\u20131967)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the generic title of a series of French comic strips that first appeared in French in the magazine Pilote on 29 October 1959?\nAnswer:\nThe Mirror World Asterix exhibition\n", "answers": ["Dartmoor National Park", "DARTMOOR", "Dartmoor National park", "Dartmoor", "Okehayes Nursery", "Dartymoor"], "pred": " High Willhays is the highest point of what National Park?

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nErrol Brown\nLester Errol Brown MBE (12 November 1943 \u2013 6 May 2015) was a British-Jamaican singer and songwriter, best known as the frontman of the soul and funk band Hot Chocolate.  \n\nCareer\n\nBrown was born in Kingston, Jamaica, but moved to the UK when he was twelve years old. His break in music came in 1969 when he recorded a version of John Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance\" with a band called \"Hot Chocolate Band\". Unable to change the lyrics without Lennon's permission, he sent a copy to his record label, Apple, and the song was released with Lennon's approval. \n\nThe Hot Chocolate albums were produced by Mickie Most and recorded at the Rak Records studio. Brown left the group in 1985 to take a hiatus from music.   He soon went on to have a solo career, achieving success in the clubs with the 1987 single \"Body Rocking\", produced by Richard James Burgess. \n\nBrown was a supporter of the Conservative Party and performed at a party conference in the 1980s. In 1981, he performed at the wedding reception following the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, at Buckingham Palace. \n\nBrown owned National Hunt horses, including Gainsay. \n\nRecognition\n\nIn 2003, Queen Elizabeth II named Brown a Member of the Order of the British Empire for \"services to popular music for the United Kingdom\".   In 2004 he received an Ivor Novello Award for outstanding contributions to British music.\n\nDeath\n\nBrown died of liver cancer at his home in the Bahamas on 6 May 2015.

It is one of four Long Distance Routes in Scotland. It begins in Aviemore and ends at Buckpool harbour in Buckie, some 65 miles away. Some choose to walk the route from Buckie to Aviemore.  There is a spur leading off the main route to Tomintoul bringing the total distance up to 80 miles (130 km). In addition, there is a Dufftown loop option, and other less well-known routes (Badenoch Way, Dava Way, and Moray Coast Trail) can be worked in, all affecting the total distance walked.  Sections of the route are open to cycling.\n\nThe Way is clearly marked with a symbol showing a thistle in a hexagon.  The route generally follows the valley of the River Spey, passing some of the distilleries that produce Speyside single malts. The final five miles from Spey Bay to Buckie follow the coastline.\n\nAn extension of the route from Aviemore to Newtonmore is currently being progressed. This extension would lengthen the total route by , roughly following the route of the River Spey and utilising part of the Sustrans cycle route. The first part of the extension, to Kincraig, was opened in 2015.\n\nA formal proposal has now been submitted and has received approval in principle from Scottish Ministers, but it still looks likely that not all landowners will be in agreement with the designated route. If instructed by the Scottish Ministers, the Cairngorms National Park Authority can implement the route against landowners' wishes under the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 and the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Negotiations are still underway to attempt to avoid this situation.\n\nThe path follows most of the route of the former Strathspey Railway.\nQuestion:\nThe 81 mile Speyside Way runs from Buckie to which town and resort in the Cairngorms?\nAnswer:\nAviemore\nPassage:\nAare\nThe Aare or Aar is a tributary of the High Rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within Switzerland.\n\nIts total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about 295 km (183 miles), during which distance it descends 1565 m, draining an area of 17779 km2, almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of Central Switzerland.  \nThere are more than 40 hydroelectric plants along the course of the Aare River.\n\nThe river's name dates to at least the La T\u00e8ne period, and it is attested as Nantaror \"Aare valley\" in the Berne zinc tablet which dates back to Roman Gaul. \nThe name was Latinized as Arula/Arola/Araris. \n\nCourse\n\nThe Aare rises in the great Aargletschers (Aare Glaciers) of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass. The Finsteraargletscher and Lauteraargletscher come together to form the Unteraargletscher (Lower Aare-Glacier), which is the main source of water for the Grimselsee. The Oberaargletscher (Upper Aare-Glacier) feeds the Oberaarsee, which also flows into the Grimselsee. The Aare river leaves the Grimselsee just to the east to the Grimsel Hospice, below the Grimsel Pass, and then flows northwest through the Haslital, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, 46 m, past Guttannen.\n\nBetween Innertkirchen and Meiringen, the river carves through a limestone ridge in the Aare Gorge or Aareschlucht. It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge. A little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake Brienz. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important tributary, the L\u00fctschine. It then runs across the swampy plain of the B\u00f6deli between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun.\n\nNear the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the Kander, which has just been joined by the Simme. Lake Thun marks the head of navigation. On flowing out of the lake it passes through Thun, and then flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the Saane or Sarine it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne. From the upper end of the lake, at Nidau, the river issues through the Nidau-B\u00fcren channel, also called the Aare Canal, and then runs east to B\u00fcren. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the \"vegetable garden of Switzerland\".\n\nFrom here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town Solothurn (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau, near which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg, where the B\u00fcnz falls in on the right. A short distance further, below Brugg it receives first the Reuss, and shortly afterwards the Limmat. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the Rhine, which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut, Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands.\n\nTributaries \n\n* Limmat\n** Reppisch\n** Sihl\n*** Alp\n*** Minster\n** Linth (main tributary of Lake Z\u00fcrich)\n*** Seez (main tributary of Lake Walen)\n*** L\u00f6ntsch\n*** Sernf\n* Reuss (see also: Reuss (river)#Tributaries)\n** Kleine Emme\n** Sarner Aa\n** Engelberger Aa\n** Sch\u00e4chen\n** Furkareuss\n* Suhre\n* B\u00fcnz\n**Aabach\n* Wigger\n* Murg (Murgenthal)\n**Rot (Roggwil)\n**Langete (Langenthal)\n***Ursenbach (Kleindietwil)\n***Rotbach (Huttwil)\n* Emme  \n* Zihlkanal\n** Suze\n** Broye\n** Orbe\n* Saane (Sarine)\n** Sense\n* Kander\n** Simme\n** Allenbach\n* L\u00fctschine (Lake Brienz)\n\nReservoirs\n\n* Lake Grimsel, 1908 m\n* Lake Brienz, 564 m\n* Lake Thun, 558 m\n* Lake Wohlen, 481 m\n* Niederriedsee, 461 m\n* Lake Biel, 429 m\n* Klingnauer Stausee, 318 m\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\nQuestion:\nWhich European city lies on the river Aare?\nAnswer:\nBerne BE\nPassage:\nDigitalis purpurea\nDigitalis purpurea (foxglove, common foxglove, purple foxglove or lady's glove) is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae, native and widespread throughout most of temperate Europe. It is also naturalised in parts of North America and some other temperate regions. The plants are well known as the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin).\n\nDescription\n\nDigitalis purpurea is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple,  long and  broad, and are covered with gray-white pubescent and glandular hairs, imparting a woolly texture. The foliage forms a tight rosette at ground level in the first year.\n\nThe flowering stem develops in the second year, typically  tall, sometimes longer. The flowers are arranged in a showy, terminal, elongated cluster, and each flower is tubular and pendent. The flowers are typically purple, but some plants, especially those under cultivation, may be pink, rose, yellow, or white. The inside surface of the flower tube is heavily spotted. The flowering period is early summer, sometimes with additional flower stems developing later in the season. The plant is frequented by bees, which climb right inside the flower tube to gain the nectar within.\n\nThe fruit is a capsule which splits open at maturity to release the numerous tiny 0.1-0.2\u00a0mm seeds.\n\nSubspecies\n\nThe three subspecies of Digitalis purpurea are:\n*D. p. subsp. purpurea \u2013 most of Europe\n*D. p. subsp. heywoodii \u2013 Iberia\n*D. p. subsp. mariana \u2013 Iberia\n\nHybrids\n\n* Digitalis x fulva, Lindl. 1821 (hybrid formula: Digitalis grandiflora Mill. \u00d7 Digitalis purpurea L.).\n\nToxicity \n\nDue to the presence of the cardiac glycoside digitoxin, the leaves, flowers and seeds of this plant are all poisonous to humans and some animals and can be fatal if ingested.\n\nExtracted from the leaves, this same compound, whose clinical use was pioneered as digitalis by William Withering, is used as a medication for heart failure. He recognized it \"reduced dropsy\", increased urine flow and had a powerful effect on the heart. Unlike the purified pharmacological forms, extracts of this plant did not frequently cause intoxication because they induced nausea and vomiting within minutes of ingestion, preventing the patient from consuming more.\n\nThe main toxins in Digitalis spp. are the two chemically similar cardiac glycosides: digitoxin and digoxin. Like other cardiac glycosides, these toxins exert their effects by inhibiting the ATPase activity of a complex of transmembrane proteins that form the sodium potassium ATPase pump, (Na+/K+-ATPase). Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in turn causes a rise not only in intracellular Na+, but also in calcium, which in turn results in increased force of myocardial muscle contractions. In other words, at precisely the right dosage, Digitalis toxin can cause the heart to beat more strongly. However, digitoxin, digoxin and several other cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, are known to have steep dose-response curves, i.e., minute increases in the dosage of these drugs can make the difference between an ineffective dose and a fatal one.\n\nSymptoms of Digitalis poisoning include a low pulse rate, nausea, vomiting, and uncoordinated contractions of different parts of the heart, leading to cardiac arrest and finally death.\n\nCultivation \n\nThe plant is popular as a garden subject, and numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of colours from white through pink to purple, such as \"Dalmatian Purple\". Cultivated forms often show flowers completely surrounding the central spike, in contrast to the wild form, where the flowers only appear on one side.  D. purpurea is easily grown from seed or purchased as potted plants in the spring. The following selections have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n*'The Shirley' \n*'Excelsior group' \n*D. purpurea f. alba \n\nDigitalis purpurea is hardy to zones 4-9. \n\nUses\n\nDigoxigenin (DIG) is a steroid found exclusively in the flowers and leaves of the plants Digitalis purpurea and Digitalis lanata. It is used as a molecular probe to detect DNA or RNA. It can easily be attached to nucleotides by chemical modifications. DIG molecules are often linked to uridine nucleotides; DIG-labeled uridine (DIG-U) can then be incorporated into RNA probes via in vitro transcription. Once hybridisation occurs in situ, RNA probes with the incorporated DIG-U can be detected with anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. To reveal the hybridised transcripts, alkaline phosphatase can be reacted with a chromogen to produce a coloured precipitate.\n\nGenetics\n\nThe colours of the petals of the Digitalis purpurea are known to be determined by at least three genes that interact with each other. \n\nThe M gene determined the production of a purple pigment, a type of antocianin. The m gene does not produce this pigment. The D gene is an enhances of the M gene, and leads it to produce a big amount of the pigment. The d gene does not enhance the M gene, and only a small amount of pigment is produced. Lastly, the W gene makes the pigment be deposited only in some spots, while the w gene allows the pigment to be spread all over the flower.\n\nThis combination leads to four phenotypes:\n\n*M/_; W/_; _/_ = a white flower with purple spots;\n*m/m; _/_; _/_ = an albino flower with yellow spots;\n*M/_; w/w; d/d = a light purple flower;\n*M/_; w/w; D/_ = a dark purple flower.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThis plant inspired a famous poem by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli titled \"Digitale Purpurea\". It also inspired the Italian industrial metal band Digitalis Purpurea.\n\nThis plant features in the 2015 video game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It is one of several harvestable plants within the game, and is used for the production of tranquilizer rounds by the Mother Base R&D team\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Digitalis Purpurea.jpg\nImage:Digitalis_purpurea_alba_01-Juni.jpg|f.albiflora\nImage:Fingerborgsblomma, closeup.jpg|Close-up of flower\nImage:Digitalis_purpurea_-_K\u00f6hler\u2013s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-053.jpg|19th century illustration\nImage:Digitalis purpurea 'Primrose Carousel' Flower Closeup 1200px.jpg|Flower close-up\nImage:Digitalis purpurea 'Primrose Carousel' Leaves 1100px.jpg|Leaves\nFile: Digitalis seed 2.JPG|Young plant a few weeks old\nFile:Digitalis_purpurea_004.JPG|Giant flower demonstrating pseudo-peloria\nQuestion:\nWhat is the alternative name for the flower digitalis purpurea?\nAnswer:\nC36H56O14\nPassage:\nA Rake's Progress\nA Rake's Progress is a series of eight paintings by 18th-century English artist William Hogarth. The canvases were produced in 1732\u201333, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. \n\nPaintings\n\nAdaptations\n\nGavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled \"The Rake's Progress\" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.\nQuestion:\nWho painted The Rake's Progress?\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nNine Elms\nNine Elms is a district of London, situated in the far north-eastern corner of the London Borough of Wandsworth between Battersea and Vauxhall in the neighbouring borough of Lambeth.\n\nThe area was formerly mainly industrial but is now becoming more residential and commercial in character. It is dominated by Battersea Power Station, various railway lines and New Covent Garden Market. Also in the area is the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.\n\nNine Elms has residential developments along the riverside, like Chelsea Bridge Wharf or Embassy Gardens, and also three large council estates\u2014Carey Gardens, the Patmore and the Savona.\n\nHistory\n\nNine Elms Lane was named around 1645, from a row of elm trees bordering the road. In 1838, at the time of construction of the London and Southampton Railway, the area was described as \"a low swampy district occasionally overflowed by the Thames [whose] osier beds, pollards and windmille and the river give it a Dutch effect\".\n\nNine Elms railway station opened on 21 May 1838 as the first London terminus of the London and South Western Railway, which that day changed its name from the London and Southampton Railway. The neo-classical building was designed by Sir William Tite. The station was connected to points between Vauxhall and London Bridge by Thames steam boats. It closed in 1848 when the railway was extended to a new terminus at Waterloo station (then called Waterloo Bridge Station). The redundant station and the adjacent area, to the north of the new mainline, became the London and South Western Railway's carriage and wagon works and main locomotive works until their relocation to Eastleigh in 1909.  The company's largest locomotive depot was located on the south side of the main line. The buildings were damaged by bombs in World War II, and closed in 1967. They were demolished in 1968 and replaced by the flower section of the New Covent Garden Market. \n\nGasworks were established in 1853, close to the existing waterworks of the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company. Later Battersea Power Station was built on the site.\n\nVauxhall Motors was formed in 1857 by Scottish engineer Alexander Wilson at Nine Elms, originally as Alex Wilson and Company, before moving to Luton in 1907. There is a plaque commemorating the site of the original factory at the Sainsbury's Nine Elms petrol station on Wandsworth Road.\n\nFuture\n\nIn October 2008 the U.S. Embassy in London announced that it would relocate to the area, moving from its current location in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair;  the new embassy is slated for completion in 2017.  The Embassy of the Netherlands in London also announced in April 2013 that it was relocating to the area from its current location in Hyde Park Gate, Kensington.  The Chinese Embassy is also rumoured to be relocating to the area. \n\nOn 16 February 2012, Wandsworth Council approved Ballymore Group's plans for the 15 acre development. Embassy Gardens is set to provide \"up to 1,982 new homes alongside shops, cafes, bars, restaurants, business space, a 100 bed hotel, a health centre, children's playgrounds and sports pitches\".Wandsworth Council: [http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/news/article/11030/embassy_gardens_plans_approved Embassy Gardens plans approved | Wandsworth Council], accessdate: 9 September 2014 In 2014, it was reported that Ballymore had engaged Lazard and CBRE Group to raise about \u20ac2.5bn to fund the Embassy Gardens development.Independent.ie: [http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/nick-webb-mulryan-is-close-to-wiping-slate-clean-30301129.html Nick Webb: Mulryan is close to wiping slate clean - Independent.ie], accessdate: 1 September 2014\n\nWork commenced in 2013 on regeneration of the area around Battersea Power Station, including shops, cafes, restaurants, art and leisure facilities, office space and residential buildings. An essential part of the work is an extension of the London Underground to service the area. The proposed extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea - creating two new stations.  The station structure itself is expected to be repaired and secure by 2016, with completion of the whole project by 2020.\n\nPart of these plans is the creation of the linear park \u2013 a car-free area extending from Battersea Power Station to Vauxhall Cross. The park will open out onto other public areas such as shops, hotels and other parks and public squares alongside homes and residential areas.The linear park will open up onto the Thames River Path at numerous points along the path, allowing access to the river\u2019s edge and the beautiful views so rare in urban areas. \n\nIn 2015, Wandsworth council chose a design by Bystrup for a \u00a340m pedestrian bridge between Nine Elms and Pimlico.\nQuestion:\nWhat moved to Nine Elms in 1974?\nAnswer:\nPubs in Covent Garden\nPassage:\nTim Gudgin\nTim Gudgin (born 26 November 1929) is a retired British radio presenter and voiceover artist. He was best known for announcing the football results on the BBC sports programmes Grandstand and Final Score between 1995 and 2011. He read the results out for the last time on 19 November 2011, just a week before his 82nd birthday. \n\nEducation and early career\n\nHe was educated at the independent Whitgift School in South Croydon, London, but did not go to university. He carried out his National Service during the 1940s, and he started his broadcasting career during that time in Germany in 1949. After completing his National Service he started a long career at the BBC.\n\nGrandstand and Final Score\n\nHe began working on Grandstand in the 1960s, initially announcing the rugby and racing results, but then succeeded Len Martin as the broadcaster of the football results after Martin's death in 1995. Gudgin was only the second person to perform the role regularly from the inception of Grandstand in 1958. After Grandstand ended in 2007, he continued to read the results on Final Score.\n\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker described Gudgin as \"one of the most familiar voices in sport\" and \"a quintessential part of Saturday afternoons in this country\".   \n\nOther work\n\nHis voice has been heard on the BBC Radio 4 quiz Quote... Unquote, Housewives' Choice, Top of the Form and Friday Night is Music Night, amongst others. Interviewed in November 2011 Gudgin said, \"I did an in-vision commercial for Square Deal Surf which bought me the first house I ever had without a mortgage, so that was well worth it.\" \n\nPersonal life\n\nGudgin is a Crystal Palace supporter and lives in Emsworth, Hampshire. He is also said to be a fan of The Fall and once persuaded Mark E. Smith to read the football scores.[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/03/01/fighting_sailors_filthy_dunkin.html Guardian Unlimited: Sport blog: Fighting sailors, filthy dunks and the genius of Jean-Pierre Papin]\n\nRetirement\n\nHe announced just prior to reading the results on the 6 August 2011 that the 2011-2012 season would be his last before retirement, with his last reading on 19 November 2011.  He later cited several reasons for his retirement including his age, the distance he would have to travel following the BBC's relocation to Salford and his granddaughter's wedding in Australia which he wanted to be there for.\n\nHis successor on Final Score is Mike West, who was the presenter of sports bulletins on BBC Radio Lancashire.\nQuestion:\nWhich BBC Radio Lancashire presenter succeeded Tim Gudgin as reader of the sports results on Grandstand and Final Score?\nAnswer:\nMichael West\nPassage:\nMost prolific mother ever | Guinness World Records\nMost prolific mother ever | Guinness World Records\nMost prolific mother ever\nWhere\nRussia Shuya\nThe greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is 69, to the wife of Feodor Vassilyev (b. 1707\u2013c.1782), a peasant from Shuya, Russia. In 27 confinements she gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets.\n***\nNumerous contemporaneous sources exist, which suggest that this seemingly improbably and statistically unlikely story is true.\nThe case was reported to Moscow by the Monastery of Nikolsk on 27 Feb 1782, which had recorded every birth. It is noted that, by this time, only two of the children who were born in the period c. 1725\u201365 failed to survive their infancy.\nThe Gentleman's Magazine (1783, 53, 753) recounts: \"In an original letter now before me, dated St Petersburg, Aug 13, 1782, O. S. Feodor Wassilief [sic], aged 75, a peasant, said to be now alive and in perfect health, in the Government of Moscow, has had\u2013\nBy his first wife:\n---------\n8 births 18 children\nIn all, 35 births, 87 children, of which 84 are living and only three buried. . . The above relation, however astonishing, may be depended upon, as it came directly from an English merchant at St Petersburg to his relatives in England, who added that the peasant was to be introduced to the Empress.\"\nIn Saint Petersburg Panorama, Bashutski, 1834, the author notes that:\n\"In the day of 27 February 1782, the list from Nikolskiy monastery came to Moscow containing the information that a peasant of the Shuya  district, Feodor Vassilyev, married twice, had 87 children. His first wife in 27 confinements gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets. His second wife in eight confinements gave birth to six pairs of twins and two sets of triplets. F. Vassilyev was 75 at that time with 82 of his children alive.\"\nAnd the Lancet (1878) refers to a twin study carried out by the French Academy and:\n\"Apropos of the enquiry, the Committee of the Academy recall an account of a quite extraordinary fecundity that was published by M. Hermann in his \"Travaux Statistiques de la Russie,\" for Fedor Vassilet [sic]. . . who, in 1782, was aged 75 years, had had, by two wives, 87 children.\"\nAside from this, not much is known about the first Mrs Vassilyev - even her first name (although some sources claim her name was Valentina).\nIt is thought she lived to the age of 76.\nAlthough this historic record should be taken with a pinch of salt, it is certainly conceivable that Mrs Vassilyev could have had a genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate (release multiple eggs in one cycle), which significantly increases the chance of having twins or multiple children.\nIt is also not impossible for a woman to have 27 pregnancies during her fertile years.\nAll records listed on our website are current and up-to-date.

Additionally, due to radioactive decay, the ore also contains oxides of lead and trace amounts of helium. It may also contain thorium, and rare earth elements.\n\nIt used to be known as pitchblende (from pitch, because of its black color, and blende, a term used by German miners to denote minerals whose density suggested metal content, but whose exploitation, at the time they were named, was either unknown, impossible or not economically feasible). The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the Ore Mountains, on the German/Czech border. The type locality is the historic mining and spa town known as Joachimsthal, the modern day J\u00e1chymov, on the Czech side of the mountains, where F.E. Br\u00fcckmann described the mineral in 1772. Pitchblende from the Johanngeorgenstadt deposit in Germany was used by M. Klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium. \n\nAll uraninite minerals contain a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Marie Curie used pitchblende, processing tons of it herself, as the source material for her isolation of radium in 1898.\n\nUraninite also always contains small amounts of the lead isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb, the end products of the decay series of the uranium isotopes 238U and 235U respectively. Small amounts of helium are also present in uraninite as a result of alpha decay. Helium was first found on Earth in uraninite after having been discovered spectroscopically in the Sun's atmosphere. The extremely rare elements technetium and promethium can be found in uraninite in very small quantities (about 200\u00a0pg/kg and 4\u00a0fg/kg respectively), produced by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238.\n\nOccurrence\n\nUraninite is a major ore of uranium. Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the initial source for the Manhattan Project) and in the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, Canada.  Another important source of pitchblende is at Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with silver. It also occurs in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany, England, Rwanda and South Africa. In the United States it can be found in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina and Wyoming. The geologist Charles Steen made a fortune on the production of Uraninite in his Mi Vida mine in Moab, Utah.\n\nUranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into yellowcake, which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.\nQuestion:\nPitchblende is the chief ore of which metallic element?\nAnswer:\n234U\nPassage:\nFinnegan's Wake\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is a ballad that arose in the 1850s in the music-hall tradition of comical Irish songs. The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born \"with a love for the liquor\", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection\u2014whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha, meaning \"water of life\". \n\nUncommon or non-standard English phrases and terms\n\n*brogue (accent)\n*hod (a tool to carry bricks in) (Slang term for a tankard or drinking vessel)\n*tippler's way (a tippler is a drunkard)\n*craythur (craythur is poteen (Poit\u00edn), \"a drop of the craythur\" is an expression to have some poteen)\n*Whack fol the dah (non-lexical vocalsinging called \"lilting\"; see Scat singing and mouth music it is also punned upon repeatedly by James Joyce as Whack 'fol the Danaan')\n*trotters (feet)\n*full (drunk)\n*mavourneen (my darling)\n*hould your gob (shut-up)\n*belt in the gob (punch in the mouth)\n*Shillelagh law (a brawl)\n*ruction (a fight)\n*bedad (an expression of shock)\n\nNon-English phrases:\n*Thanam 'on dhoul (Irish: Th'anam 'on diabhal, \"your soul to the devil\") However, in other versions of the song, Tim says \"Thunderin' Jaysus.\"\n\nUse in literature \n\nThe song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the \"water of life\", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word \"wake\" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of \"Finnegans\", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  \n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage. \n\nRecordings \n\nMany Irish bands have performed Finnegan's Wake including notably:\n\n*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including Come Fill Your Glass with Us (1959), A Spontaneous Performance Recording (1961), Recorded Live in Ireland (1965), and the 1984 Reunion concert at Lincoln Center. \n*The Dubliners on several live albums. \n*Dropkick Murphys on their albums Do or Die and Live on St. Patrick's Day From Boston, MA. \n*Brobdingnagian Bards on their album Songs of Ireland.\n*The Tossers on their album Communication & Conviction: Last Seven Years.\n*Orthodox Celts on their album The Celts Strike Again.\n*Darby O'Gill on their album Waitin' for a Ride.\n*Ryan's Fancy on their album Newfoundland Drinking Songs.\n*Beatnik Turtle on their album Sham Rock\n*Irish Rovers\n*Christy Moore on his album The Box Set 1964\u20132004\n*Donut Kings on their single Donut Kings Pub With No Beer\n*Schooner Fare on their album Finnegan's Wake\n*Woods Tea Company on their album The Wood's Tea Co. \u2013 Live!\n*Steve Benbow on his album Songs of Ireland\n*Roger McGuinn in his Folk Den series.\n*Dominic Behan on his album Down by the Liffeyside\n*Poxy Boggards on their albums Barley Legal and Bitter and Stout\n*Seamus Kennedy on his album By Popular Demand\n*The High Kings on their albums Memory Lane and Live in Ireland\nQuestion:\n\"What is the occupation of the title character in \"\"Finnegan's Wake\"\" by James Joyce?\"\nAnswer:\nHodcarrier\nPassage:\nFrame drum\nA frame drum is a drum that has a drumhead width greater than its depth. Usually the single drumhead is made of rawhide or man-made materials. Shells are traditionally constructed of bent wood (rosewood, oak, ash etc.) scarf jointed together; plywood and man-made materials are also used. Some frame drums have mechanical tuning and on many the drumhead is stretched and tacked in place. It is the earliest skin drum known to have existed. Examples are found in many places and cultures. It has been suggested  that they were also used to winnow grain.\n\nThe frame drum is one of the most ancient musical instruments; it is reputed to be the first drum to be invented. Frame drums are often constructed with a round, wooden frame. Metal rings or jingles may also be attached to the frame.

In addition to numerous fossil species, up to sixteen extant species are currently recognized, classified into between four and eight genera. The family includes the domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus or Sus domesticus, in addition to numerous species of wild pig, such as the babirusa Babyrousa babyrussa and the warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus. All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia and its islands, to Europe, and Africa.\n\nThe earliest fossil suids date from the Oligocene epoch of Asia, and their descendants reached Europe during the Miocene.  Several fossil species are known, and show adaptations to a wide range of different diets, from strict herbivory to possible carrion-eating (in Tetraconodon).\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nSuids belong to the order Artiodactyla, and are generally regarded as the living members of that order most similar to the ancestral form. Unlike most other members of the order, they have four toes on each foot, although they walk only on the middle two digits, with the others staying clear of the ground. They also have a simple stomach, rather than the more complex, ruminant, stomach found in most other artiodactyl families.\n\nThey are small to medium animals, varying in size from 58 to in length, and 6 to in weight in the case of the pygmy hog, to 130 - and 100 - in the giant forest hog.  They have large heads and short necks, with relatively small eyes and prominent ears. Their heads have a distinctive snout, ending in a disc-shaped nose. Suids typically have a bristly coat, and a short tail ending in a tassle. The males possess a corkscrew-shaped penis, which fits into a similarly shaped groove in the female's cervix.   \n\nSuids have a well-developed sense of hearing, and are vocal animals, communicating with a series of grunts, squeals, and similar sounds. They also have an acute sense of smell. Many species are omnivorous, eating grass, leaves, roots, insects, worms, and even frogs or mice. Other species are more selective and purely herbivorous.\n\nTheir teeth reflect their diet, and suids retain the upper incisors, which are lost in most other Artiodactyls. The canine teeth are enlarged to form prominent tusks, used for rooting in moist earth or undergrowth, and in fighting. They have only a short diastema. The number of teeth varies between species, but the general dental formula is: \n\nBehaviour and reproduction\n\nSuids are intelligent and adaptable animals. Adult females (sows) and their young travel in a group (sounder; see List of animal names), while adult males (boars) are either solitary, or travel in small bachelor groups. Males generally are not territorial, and come into conflict only during the mating season.\n\nLitter size varies between one and twelve, depending on the species. The mother prepares a grass nest or similar den, which the young leave after about ten days. Suids are weaned at around three months, and become sexually mature at 18 months. In practice, however, male suids are unlikely to gain access to sows in the wild until they have reached their full physical size, at around four years of age.

In addition to numerous fossil species, up to sixteen extant species are currently recognized, classified into between four and eight genera. The family includes the domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus or Sus domesticus, in addition to numerous species of wild pig, such as the babirusa Babyrousa babyrussa and the warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus. All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia and its islands, to Europe, and Africa.\n\nThe earliest fossil suids date from the Oligocene epoch of Asia, and their descendants reached Europe during the Miocene.  Several fossil species are known, and show adaptations to a wide range of different diets, from strict herbivory to possible carrion-eating (in Tetraconodon).\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nSuids belong to the order Artiodactyla, and are generally regarded as the living members of that order most similar to the ancestral form. Unlike most other members of the order, they have four toes on each foot, although they walk only on the middle two digits, with the others staying clear of the ground. They also have a simple stomach, rather than the more complex, ruminant, stomach found in most other artiodactyl families.\n\nThey are small to medium animals, varying in size from 58 to in length, and 6 to in weight in the case of the pygmy hog, to 130 - and 100 - in the giant forest hog.  They have large heads and short necks, with relatively small eyes and prominent ears. Their heads have a distinctive snout, ending in a disc-shaped nose. Suids typically have a bristly coat, and a short tail ending in a tassle. The males possess a corkscrew-shaped penis, which fits into a similarly shaped groove in the female's cervix.   \n\nSuids have a well-developed sense of hearing, and are vocal animals, communicating with a series of grunts, squeals, and similar sounds. They also have an acute sense of smell. Many species are omnivorous, eating grass, leaves, roots, insects, worms, and even frogs or mice. Other species are more selective and purely herbivorous.\n\nTheir teeth reflect their diet, and suids retain the upper incisors, which are lost in most other Artiodactyls. The canine teeth are enlarged to form prominent tusks, used for rooting in moist earth or undergrowth, and in fighting. They have only a short diastema. The number of teeth varies between species, but the general dental formula is: \n\nBehaviour and reproduction\n\nSuids are intelligent and adaptable animals. Adult females (sows) and their young travel in a group (sounder; see List of animal names), while adult males (boars) are either solitary, or travel in small bachelor groups. Males generally are not territorial, and come into conflict only during the mating season.\n\nLitter size varies between one and twelve, depending on the species. The mother prepares a grass nest or similar den, which the young leave after about ten days. Suids are weaned at around three months, and become sexually mature at 18 months. In practice, however, male suids are unlikely to gain access to sows in the wild until they have reached their full physical size, at around four years of age. In all species, the male is significantly larger than the female, and possesses more prominent tusks.\n\nClassification\n\n \nThe complete list of living species, and a partial list of extinct genera known from the fossil record,   extinct taxa marked with a dagger \"\u2020\", are:\n\n*Suidae\n**Subfamily \u2020Cainochoerinae\n***Genus \u2020Albanohyus\n***Genus \u2020Cainochoerus\n**Subfamily \u2020Hyotheriinae\n***Genus \u2020Aureliachoerus\n***Genus \u2020Chicochoerus\n***Genus \u2020Hyotherium\n***Genus \u2020Nguruwe (formerly placed in Kubanochoerinae) \n***Genus \u2020Xenohyus\n**Subfamily \u2020Listriodontinae \n***Tribe \u2020Kubanochoerini\n****Genus \u2020Kubanochoerus (junior synonyms Libycochoerus, Megalochoerus)\n***Tribe \u2020Listriodontini\n****Genus \u2020Eurolistriodon\n****Genus \u2020Listriodon (junior synonym Bunolistriodon)\n***Tribe \u2020Namachoerini\n****Genus \u2020Lopholistriodon\n****Genus \u2020Namachoerus\n***Tribe incertae sedis\n****Genus \u2020Dicoryphochoerus\n**Subfamily Suinae\n***Tribe Babyrousini\n****Genus Babyrousa (Pleistocene to recent)\n*****Species B. babyrussa Buru babirusa\n*****Species \u2020B. bolabatuensis Bola Batu babirusa\n*****Species Babyrousa celebensis North Sulawesi babirusa\n*****Species Babyrousa togeanensis Togian babirusa\n***Tribe \u2020Hippohyini\n****Genus \u2020Hippohyus (Miocene to Pleistocene)\n****Genus \u2020Sinohyus (Miocene)\n****Genus \u2020Sivahyus (Miocene to Pliocene)\n***Tribe Potamochoerini\n****Genus \u2020Celebochoerus (Pliocene to Pleistocene)\n****Genus Hylochoerus (Pleistocene to recent)\n*****Species Hylochoerus meinertzhageni giant forest hog\n****Genus \u2020Kolpochoerus (Pliocene to Pleistocene) (junior synonyms Ectopotamochoerus, Mesochoerus, Omochoerus, Promesochoerus)\n****Genus Potamochoerus (Miocene to recent)\n*****Species P. larvatus bushpig\n*****Species P. porcus red river hog\n****Genus \u2020Propotamochoerus (Miocene to Pliocene)\n***Tribe Suini\n****Genus \u2020Eumaiochoerus (Miocene)\n****Genus \u2020Hippopotamodon (Miocene to Pleistocene)  (junior synonym Limnostonyx)\n****Genus \u2020Korynochoerus (Miocene to Pliocene)\n****Genus \u2020Microstonyx (Miocene)\n****Genus Sus (Miocene to recent)\n*****Species S. ahoenobarbus Palawan bearded pig\n*****Species S. barbatus Bornean bearded pig\n*****Species S. bucculentus Heude's pig or Vietnamese warty pig\n*****Species S. cebifrons Visayan warty pig\n*****Species S. celebensis Celebes warty pig\n*****Species S. heureni Flores warty pig\n*****Species S. oliveri Mindoro warty pig\n*****Species S. philippensis Philippine warty pig\n*****Species S. scrofa (also called S. domesticus) domestic pig, wild boar\n*****Species S. verrucosus Java warty pig\n*****Species \u2020S. strozzi\n***Tribe Phacochoerini\n****Genus \u2020Metridiochoerus (Pliocene to Pleistocene)\n****Genus Phacochoerus (Pliocene to recent)\n*****Species P. aethiopicus Cape, Somali or desert warthog\n*****Species P. africanus common warthog\n****Genus \u2020Potamochoeroides (Pliocene, possibly Pleistocene)\n****Genus \u2020Stylochoerus (Pleistocene)\n***Tribe incertae sedis  \n****Genus Porcula\n*****Species P. salvania pygmy hog\n** Subfamily \u2020Tetraconodontinae\n*** Genus \u2020Conohyus\n*** Genus \u2020Notochoerus\n*** Genus \u2020Nyanzachoerus\n*** Genus \u2020Parachleuastochoerus\n*** Genus \u2020Sivachoerus\n*** Genus \u2020Tetraconodon (Miocene, Myanmar)  \n****Species \u2020T. intermedius\n****Species \u2020T. malensis\n****Species \u2020T. minor\n**Subfamily incertae sedis\n***Genus \u2020Chleuastochoerus\n***Genus \u2020Hemichoerus\n***Genus \u2020Hyosus\n***Genus \u2020Kenyasus (formerly placed in Kubanochoerinae)\n***Genus \u2020Schizochoerus\n***Genus \u2020Sinapriculus\nQuestion:\nArtiodactyla Suidae is the scientific name for which farm animal?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nErrol Brown\nLester Errol Brown MBE (12 November 1943 \u2013 6 May 2015) was a British-Jamaican singer and songwriter, best known as the frontman of the soul and funk band Hot Chocolate.  \n\nCareer\n\nBrown was born in Kingston, Jamaica, but moved to the UK when he was twelve years old. His break in music came in 1969 when he recorded a version of John Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance\" with a band called \"Hot Chocolate Band\". Unable to change the lyrics without Lennon's permission, he sent a copy to his record label, Apple, and the song was released with Lennon's approval. \n\nThe Hot Chocolate albums were produced by Mickie Most and recorded at the Rak Records studio. Brown left the group in 1985 to take a hiatus from music.   He soon went on to have a solo career, achieving success in the clubs with the 1987 single \"Body Rocking\", produced by Richard James Burgess. \n\nBrown was a supporter of the Conservative Party and performed at a party conference in the 1980s. In 1981, he performed at the wedding reception following the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, at Buckingham Palace. \n\nBrown owned National Hunt horses, including Gainsay. \n\nRecognition\n\nIn 2003, Queen Elizabeth II named Brown a Member of the Order of the British Empire for \"services to popular music for the United Kingdom\".   In 2004 he received an Ivor Novello Award for outstanding contributions to British music.\n\nDeath\n\nBrown died of liver cancer at his home in the Bahamas on 6 May 2015.

It is one of four Long Distance Routes in Scotland. It begins in Aviemore and ends at Buckpool harbour in Buckie, some 65 miles away. Some choose to walk the route from Buckie to Aviemore.  There is a spur leading off the main route to Tomintoul bringing the total distance up to 80 miles (130 km). In addition, there is a Dufftown loop option, and other less well-known routes (Badenoch Way, Dava Way, and Moray Coast Trail) can be worked in, all affecting the total distance walked.  Sections of the route are open to cycling.\n\nThe Way is clearly marked with a symbol showing a thistle in a hexagon.  The route generally follows the valley of the River Spey, passing some of the distilleries that produce Speyside single malts. The final five miles from Spey Bay to Buckie follow the coastline.\n\nAn extension of the route from Aviemore to Newtonmore is currently being progressed. This extension would lengthen the total route by , roughly following the route of the River Spey and utilising part of the Sustrans cycle route. The first part of the extension, to Kincraig, was opened in 2015.\n\nA formal proposal has now been submitted and has received approval in principle from Scottish Ministers, but it still looks likely that not all landowners will be in agreement with the designated route. If instructed by the Scottish Ministers, the Cairngorms National Park Authority can implement the route against landowners' wishes under the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 and the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Negotiations are still underway to attempt to avoid this situation.\n\nThe path follows most of the route of the former Strathspey Railway.\nQuestion:\nThe 81 mile Speyside Way runs from Buckie to which town and resort in the Cairngorms?\nAnswer:\nAviemore\nPassage:\nAare\nThe Aare or Aar is a tributary of the High Rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within Switzerland.\n\nIts total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about 295 km (183 miles), during which distance it descends 1565 m, draining an area of 17779 km2, almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of Central Switzerland.  \nThere are more than 40 hydroelectric plants along the course of the Aare River.\n\nThe river's name dates to at least the La T\u00e8ne period, and it is attested as Nantaror \"Aare valley\" in the Berne zinc tablet which dates back to Roman Gaul. \nThe name was Latinized as Arula/Arola/Araris. \n\nCourse\n\nThe Aare rises in the great Aargletschers (Aare Glaciers) of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass. The Finsteraargletscher and Lauteraargletscher come together to form the Unteraargletscher (Lower Aare-Glacier), which is the main source of water for the Grimselsee. The Oberaargletscher (Upper Aare-Glacier) feeds the Oberaarsee, which also flows into the Grimselsee. The Aare river leaves the Grimselsee just to the east to the Grimsel Hospice, below the Grimsel Pass, and then flows northwest through the Haslital, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, 46 m, past Guttannen.\n\nBetween Innertkirchen and Meiringen, the river carves through a limestone ridge in the Aare Gorge or Aareschlucht. It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge. A little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake Brienz. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important tributary, the L\u00fctschine. It then runs across the swampy plain of the B\u00f6deli between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun.\n\nNear the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the Kander, which has just been joined by the Simme. Lake Thun marks the head of navigation. On flowing out of the lake it passes through Thun, and then flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the Saane or Sarine it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne. From the upper end of the lake, at Nidau, the river issues through the Nidau-B\u00fcren channel, also called the Aare Canal, and then runs east to B\u00fcren. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the \"vegetable garden of Switzerland\".\n\nFrom here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town Solothurn (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau, near which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg, where the B\u00fcnz falls in on the right. A short distance further, below Brugg it receives first the Reuss, and shortly afterwards the Limmat. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the Rhine, which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut, Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands.\n\nTributaries \n\n* Limmat\n** Reppisch\n** Sihl\n*** Alp\n*** Minster\n** Linth (main tributary of Lake Z\u00fcrich)\n*** Seez (main tributary of Lake Walen)\n*** L\u00f6ntsch\n*** Sernf\n* Reuss (see also: Reuss (river)#Tributaries)\n** Kleine Emme\n** Sarner Aa\n** Engelberger Aa\n** Sch\u00e4chen\n** Furkareuss\n* Suhre\n* B\u00fcnz\n**Aabach\n* Wigger\n* Murg (Murgenthal)\n**Rot (Roggwil)\n**Langete (Langenthal)\n***Ursenbach (Kleindietwil)\n***Rotbach (Huttwil)\n* Emme  \n* Zihlkanal\n** Suze\n** Broye\n** Orbe\n* Saane (Sarine)\n** Sense\n* Kander\n** Simme\n** Allenbach\n* L\u00fctschine (Lake Brienz)\n\nReservoirs\n\n* Lake Grimsel, 1908 m\n* Lake Brienz, 564 m\n* Lake Thun, 558 m\n* Lake Wohlen, 481 m\n* Niederriedsee, 461 m\n* Lake Biel, 429 m\n* Klingnauer Stausee, 318 m\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\nQuestion:\nWhich European city lies on the river Aare?\nAnswer:\nBerne BE\nPassage:\nDigitalis purpurea\nDigitalis purpurea (foxglove, common foxglove, purple foxglove or lady's glove) is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae, native and widespread throughout most of temperate Europe. It is also naturalised in parts of North America and some other temperate regions. The plants are well known as the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin).\n\nDescription\n\nDigitalis purpurea is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple,  long and  broad, and are covered with gray-white pubescent and glandular hairs, imparting a woolly texture. The foliage forms a tight rosette at ground level in the first year.\n\nThe flowering stem develops in the second year, typically  tall, sometimes longer. The flowers are arranged in a showy, terminal, elongated cluster, and each flower is tubular and pendent. The flowers are typically purple, but some plants, especially those under cultivation, may be pink, rose, yellow, or white. The inside surface of the flower tube is heavily spotted. The flowering period is early summer, sometimes with additional flower stems developing later in the season. The plant is frequented by bees, which climb right inside the flower tube to gain the nectar within.\n\nThe fruit is a capsule which splits open at maturity to release the numerous tiny 0.1-0.2\u00a0mm seeds.\n\nSubspecies\n\nThe three subspecies of Digitalis purpurea are:\n*D. p. subsp. purpurea \u2013 most of Europe\n*D. p. subsp. heywoodii \u2013 Iberia\n*D. p. subsp. mariana \u2013 Iberia\n\nHybrids\n\n* Digitalis x fulva, Lindl. 1821 (hybrid formula: Digitalis grandiflora Mill. \u00d7 Digitalis purpurea L.).\n\nToxicity \n\nDue to the presence of the cardiac glycoside digitoxin, the leaves, flowers and seeds of this plant are all poisonous to humans and some animals and can be fatal if ingested.\n\nExtracted from the leaves, this same compound, whose clinical use was pioneered as digitalis by William Withering, is used as a medication for heart failure. He recognized it \"reduced dropsy\", increased urine flow and had a powerful effect on the heart. Unlike the purified pharmacological forms, extracts of this plant did not frequently cause intoxication because they induced nausea and vomiting within minutes of ingestion, preventing the patient from consuming more.\n\nThe main toxins in Digitalis spp. are the two chemically similar cardiac glycosides: digitoxin and digoxin. Like other cardiac glycosides, these toxins exert their effects by inhibiting the ATPase activity of a complex of transmembrane proteins that form the sodium potassium ATPase pump, (Na+/K+-ATPase). Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in turn causes a rise not only in intracellular Na+, but also in calcium, which in turn results in increased force of myocardial muscle contractions. In other words, at precisely the right dosage, Digitalis toxin can cause the heart to beat more strongly. However, digitoxin, digoxin and several other cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, are known to have steep dose-response curves, i.e., minute increases in the dosage of these drugs can make the difference between an ineffective dose and a fatal one.\n\nSymptoms of Digitalis poisoning include a low pulse rate, nausea, vomiting, and uncoordinated contractions of different parts of the heart, leading to cardiac arrest and finally death.\n\nCultivation \n\nThe plant is popular as a garden subject, and numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of colours from white through pink to purple, such as \"Dalmatian Purple\". Cultivated forms often show flowers completely surrounding the central spike, in contrast to the wild form, where the flowers only appear on one side.  D. purpurea is easily grown from seed or purchased as potted plants in the spring. The following selections have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n*'The Shirley' \n*'Excelsior group' \n*D. purpurea f. alba \n\nDigitalis purpurea is hardy to zones 4-9. \n\nUses\n\nDigoxigenin (DIG) is a steroid found exclusively in the flowers and leaves of the plants Digitalis purpurea and Digitalis lanata. It is used as a molecular probe to detect DNA or RNA. It can easily be attached to nucleotides by chemical modifications. DIG molecules are often linked to uridine nucleotides; DIG-labeled uridine (DIG-U) can then be incorporated into RNA probes via in vitro transcription. Once hybridisation occurs in situ, RNA probes with the incorporated DIG-U can be detected with anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. To reveal the hybridised transcripts, alkaline phosphatase can be reacted with a chromogen to produce a coloured precipitate.\n\nGenetics\n\nThe colours of the petals of the Digitalis purpurea are known to be determined by at least three genes that interact with each other. \n\nThe M gene determined the production of a purple pigment, a type of antocianin. The m gene does not produce this pigment. The D gene is an enhances of the M gene, and leads it to produce a big amount of the pigment. The d gene does not enhance the M gene, and only a small amount of pigment is produced. Lastly, the W gene makes the pigment be deposited only in some spots, while the w gene allows the pigment to be spread all over the flower.\n\nThis combination leads to four phenotypes:\n\n*M/_; W/_; _/_ = a white flower with purple spots;\n*m/m; _/_; _/_ = an albino flower with yellow spots;\n*M/_; w/w; d/d = a light purple flower;\n*M/_; w/w; D/_ = a dark purple flower.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThis plant inspired a famous poem by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli titled \"Digitale Purpurea\". It also inspired the Italian industrial metal band Digitalis Purpurea.\n\nThis plant features in the 2015 video game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It is one of several harvestable plants within the game, and is used for the production of tranquilizer rounds by the Mother Base R&D team\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Digitalis Purpurea.jpg\nImage:Digitalis_purpurea_alba_01-Juni.jpg|f.albiflora\nImage:Fingerborgsblomma, closeup.jpg|Close-up of flower\nImage:Digitalis_purpurea_-_K\u00f6hler\u2013s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-053.jpg|19th century illustration\nImage:Digitalis purpurea 'Primrose Carousel' Flower Closeup 1200px.jpg|Flower close-up\nImage:Digitalis purpurea 'Primrose Carousel' Leaves 1100px.jpg|Leaves\nFile: Digitalis seed 2.JPG|Young plant a few weeks old\nFile:Digitalis_purpurea_004.JPG|Giant flower demonstrating pseudo-peloria\nQuestion:\nWhat is the alternative name for the flower digitalis purpurea?\nAnswer:\nC36H56O14\nPassage:\nA Rake's Progress\nA Rake's Progress is a series of eight paintings by 18th-century English artist William Hogarth. The canvases were produced in 1732\u201333, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. \n\nPaintings\n\nAdaptations\n\nGavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled \"The Rake's Progress\" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.\nQuestion:\nWho painted The Rake's Progress?\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nNine Elms\nNine Elms is a district of London, situated in the far north-eastern corner of the London Borough of Wandsworth between Battersea and Vauxhall in the neighbouring borough of Lambeth.\n\nThe area was formerly mainly industrial but is now becoming more residential and commercial in character. It is dominated by Battersea Power Station, various railway lines and New Covent Garden Market. Also in the area is the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.\n\nNine Elms has residential developments along the riverside, like Chelsea Bridge Wharf or Embassy Gardens, and also three large council estates\u2014Carey Gardens, the Patmore and the Savona.\n\nHistory\n\nNine Elms Lane was named around 1645, from a row of elm trees bordering the road. In 1838, at the time of construction of the London and Southampton Railway, the area was described as \"a low swampy district occasionally overflowed by the Thames [whose] osier beds, pollards and windmille and the river give it a Dutch effect\".\n\nNine Elms railway station opened on 21 May 1838 as the first London terminus of the London and South Western Railway, which that day changed its name from the London and Southampton Railway. The neo-classical building was designed by Sir William Tite. The station was connected to points between Vauxhall and London Bridge by Thames steam boats. It closed in 1848 when the railway was extended to a new terminus at Waterloo station (then called Waterloo Bridge Station). The redundant station and the adjacent area, to the north of the new mainline, became the London and South Western Railway's carriage and wagon works and main locomotive works until their relocation to Eastleigh in 1909.  The company's largest locomotive depot was located on the south side of the main line. The buildings were damaged by bombs in World War II, and closed in 1967. They were demolished in 1968 and replaced by the flower section of the New Covent Garden Market. \n\nGasworks were established in 1853, close to the existing waterworks of the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company. Later Battersea Power Station was built on the site.\n\nVauxhall Motors was formed in 1857 by Scottish engineer Alexander Wilson at Nine Elms, originally as Alex Wilson and Company, before moving to Luton in 1907. There is a plaque commemorating the site of the original factory at the Sainsbury's Nine Elms petrol station on Wandsworth Road.\n\nFuture\n\nIn October 2008 the U.S. Embassy in London announced that it would relocate to the area, moving from its current location in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair;  the new embassy is slated for completion in 2017.  The Embassy of the Netherlands in London also announced in April 2013 that it was relocating to the area from its current location in Hyde Park Gate, Kensington.  The Chinese Embassy is also rumoured to be relocating to the area. \n\nOn 16 February 2012, Wandsworth Council approved Ballymore Group's plans for the 15 acre development. Embassy Gardens is set to provide \"up to 1,982 new homes alongside shops, cafes, bars, restaurants, business space, a 100 bed hotel, a health centre, children's playgrounds and sports pitches\".Wandsworth Council: [http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/news/article/11030/embassy_gardens_plans_approved Embassy Gardens plans approved | Wandsworth Council], accessdate: 9 September 2014 In 2014, it was reported that Ballymore had engaged Lazard and CBRE Group to raise about \u20ac2.5bn to fund the Embassy Gardens development.Independent.ie: [http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/nick-webb-mulryan-is-close-to-wiping-slate-clean-30301129.html Nick Webb: Mulryan is close to wiping slate clean - Independent.ie], accessdate: 1 September 2014\n\nWork commenced in 2013 on regeneration of the area around Battersea Power Station, including shops, cafes, restaurants, art and leisure facilities, office space and residential buildings. An essential part of the work is an extension of the London Underground to service the area. The proposed extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea - creating two new stations.  The station structure itself is expected to be repaired and secure by 2016, with completion of the whole project by 2020.\n\nPart of these plans is the creation of the linear park \u2013 a car-free area extending from Battersea Power Station to Vauxhall Cross. The park will open out onto other public areas such as shops, hotels and other parks and public squares alongside homes and residential areas.The linear park will open up onto the Thames River Path at numerous points along the path, allowing access to the river\u2019s edge and the beautiful views so rare in urban areas. \n\nIn 2015, Wandsworth council chose a design by Bystrup for a \u00a340m pedestrian bridge between Nine Elms and Pimlico.\nQuestion:\nWhat moved to Nine Elms in 1974?\nAnswer:\nPubs in Covent Garden\nPassage:\nTim Gudgin\nTim Gudgin (born 26 November 1929) is a retired British radio presenter and voiceover artist. He was best known for announcing the football results on the BBC sports programmes Grandstand and Final Score between 1995 and 2011. He read the results out for the last time on 19 November 2011, just a week before his 82nd birthday. \n\nEducation and early career\n\nHe was educated at the independent Whitgift School in South Croydon, London, but did not go to university. He carried out his National Service during the 1940s, and he started his broadcasting career during that time in Germany in 1949. After completing his National Service he started a long career at the BBC.\n\nGrandstand and Final Score\n\nHe began working on Grandstand in the 1960s, initially announcing the rugby and racing results, but then succeeded Len Martin as the broadcaster of the football results after Martin's death in 1995. Gudgin was only the second person to perform the role regularly from the inception of Grandstand in 1958. After Grandstand ended in 2007, he continued to read the results on Final Score.\n\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker described Gudgin as \"one of the most familiar voices in sport\" and \"a quintessential part of Saturday afternoons in this country\".   \n\nOther work\n\nHis voice has been heard on the BBC Radio 4 quiz Quote... Unquote, Housewives' Choice, Top of the Form and Friday Night is Music Night, amongst others. Interviewed in November 2011 Gudgin said, \"I did an in-vision commercial for Square Deal Surf which bought me the first house I ever had without a mortgage, so that was well worth it.\" \n\nPersonal life\n\nGudgin is a Crystal Palace supporter and lives in Emsworth, Hampshire. He is also said to be a fan of The Fall and once persuaded Mark E. Smith to read the football scores.[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/03/01/fighting_sailors_filthy_dunkin.html Guardian Unlimited: Sport blog: Fighting sailors, filthy dunks and the genius of Jean-Pierre Papin]\n\nRetirement\n\nHe announced just prior to reading the results on the 6 August 2011 that the 2011-2012 season would be his last before retirement, with his last reading on 19 November 2011.  He later cited several reasons for his retirement including his age, the distance he would have to travel following the BBC's relocation to Salford and his granddaughter's wedding in Australia which he wanted to be there for.\n\nHis successor on Final Score is Mike West, who was the presenter of sports bulletins on BBC Radio Lancashire.\nQuestion:\nWhich BBC Radio Lancashire presenter succeeded Tim Gudgin as reader of the sports results on Grandstand and Final Score?\nAnswer:\nMichael West\nPassage:\nMost prolific mother ever | Guinness World Records\nMost prolific mother ever | Guinness World Records\nMost prolific mother ever\nWhere\nRussia Shuya\nThe greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is 69, to the wife of Feodor Vassilyev (b. 1707\u2013c.1782), a peasant from Shuya, Russia. In 27 confinements she gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets.\n***\nNumerous contemporaneous sources exist, which suggest that this seemingly improbably and statistically unlikely story is true.\nThe case was reported to Moscow by the Monastery of Nikolsk on 27 Feb 1782, which had recorded every birth. It is noted that, by this time, only two of the children who were born in the period c. 1725\u201365 failed to survive their infancy.\nThe Gentleman's Magazine (1783, 53, 753) recounts: \"In an original letter now before me, dated St Petersburg, Aug 13, 1782, O. S. Feodor Wassilief [sic], aged 75, a peasant, said to be now alive and in perfect health, in the Government of Moscow, has had\u2013\nBy his first wife:\n---------\n8 births 18 children\nIn all, 35 births, 87 children, of which 84 are living and only three buried. . . The above relation, however astonishing, may be depended upon, as it came directly from an English merchant at St Petersburg to his relatives in England, who added that the peasant was to be introduced to the Empress.\"\nIn Saint Petersburg Panorama, Bashutski, 1834, the author notes that:\n\"In the day of 27 February 1782, the list from Nikolskiy monastery came to Moscow containing the information that a peasant of the Shuya  district, Feodor Vassilyev, married twice, had 87 children. His first wife in 27 confinements gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets. His second wife in eight confinements gave birth to six pairs of twins and two sets of triplets. F. Vassilyev was 75 at that time with 82 of his children alive.\"\nAnd the Lancet (1878) refers to a twin study carried out by the French Academy and:\n\"Apropos of the enquiry, the Committee of the Academy recall an account of a quite extraordinary fecundity that was published by M. Hermann in his \"Travaux Statistiques de la Russie,\" for Fedor Vassilet [sic]. . . who, in 1782, was aged 75 years, had had, by two wives, 87 children.\"\nAside from this, not much is known about the first Mrs Vassilyev - even her first name (although some sources claim her name was Valentina).\nIt is thought she lived to the age of 76.\nAlthough this historic record should be taken with a pinch of salt, it is certainly conceivable that Mrs Vassilyev could have had a genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate (release multiple eggs in one cycle), which significantly increases the chance of having twins or multiple children.\nIt is also not impossible for a woman to have 27 pregnancies during her fertile years.\nAll records listed on our website are current and up-to-date.

Additionally, due to radioactive decay, the ore also contains oxides of lead and trace amounts of helium. It may also contain thorium, and rare earth elements.\n\nIt used to be known as pitchblende (from pitch, because of its black color, and blende, a term used by German miners to denote minerals whose density suggested metal content, but whose exploitation, at the time they were named, was either unknown, impossible or not economically feasible). The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the Ore Mountains, on the German/Czech border. The type locality is the historic mining and spa town known as Joachimsthal, the modern day J\u00e1chymov, on the Czech side of the mountains, where F.E. Br\u00fcckmann described the mineral in 1772. Pitchblende from the Johanngeorgenstadt deposit in Germany was used by M. Klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium. \n\nAll uraninite minerals contain a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Marie Curie used pitchblende, processing tons of it herself, as the source material for her isolation of radium in 1898.\n\nUraninite also always contains small amounts of the lead isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb, the end products of the decay series of the uranium isotopes 238U and 235U respectively. Small amounts of helium are also present in uraninite as a result of alpha decay. Helium was first found on Earth in uraninite after having been discovered spectroscopically in the Sun's atmosphere. The extremely rare elements technetium and promethium can be found in uraninite in very small quantities (about 200\u00a0pg/kg and 4\u00a0fg/kg respectively), produced by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238.\n\nOccurrence\n\nUraninite is a major ore of uranium. Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the initial source for the Manhattan Project) and in the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, Canada.  Another important source of pitchblende is at Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with silver. It also occurs in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany, England, Rwanda and South Africa. In the United States it can be found in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina and Wyoming. The geologist Charles Steen made a fortune on the production of Uraninite in his Mi Vida mine in Moab, Utah.\n\nUranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into yellowcake, which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.\nQuestion:\nPitchblende is the chief ore of which metallic element?\nAnswer:\n234U\nPassage:\nFinnegan's Wake\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is a ballad that arose in the 1850s in the music-hall tradition of comical Irish songs. The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born \"with a love for the liquor\", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection\u2014whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha, meaning \"water of life\". \n\nUncommon or non-standard English phrases and terms\n\n*brogue (accent)\n*hod (a tool to carry bricks in) (Slang term for a tankard or drinking vessel)\n*tippler's way (a tippler is a drunkard)\n*craythur (craythur is poteen (Poit\u00edn), \"a drop of the craythur\" is an expression to have some poteen)\n*Whack fol the dah (non-lexical vocalsinging called \"lilting\"; see Scat singing and mouth music it is also punned upon repeatedly by James Joyce as Whack 'fol the Danaan')\n*trotters (feet)\n*full (drunk)\n*mavourneen (my darling)\n*hould your gob (shut-up)\n*belt in the gob (punch in the mouth)\n*Shillelagh law (a brawl)\n*ruction (a fight)\n*bedad (an expression of shock)\n\nNon-English phrases:\n*Thanam 'on dhoul (Irish: Th'anam 'on diabhal, \"your soul to the devil\") However, in other versions of the song, Tim says \"Thunderin' Jaysus.\"\n\nUse in literature \n\nThe song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the \"water of life\", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word \"wake\" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of \"Finnegans\", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  \n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage. \n\nRecordings \n\nMany Irish bands have performed Finnegan's Wake including notably:\n\n*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including Come Fill Your Glass with Us (1959), A Spontaneous Performance Recording (1961), Recorded Live in Ireland (1965), and the 1984 Reunion concert at Lincoln Center. \n*The Dubliners on several live albums. \n*Dropkick Murphys on their albums Do or Die and Live on St. Patrick's Day From Boston, MA. \n*Brobdingnagian Bards on their album Songs of Ireland.\n*The Tossers on their album Communication & Conviction: Last Seven Years.\n*Orthodox Celts on their album The Celts Strike Again.\n*Darby O'Gill on their album Waitin' for a Ride.\n*Ryan's Fancy on their album Newfoundland Drinking Songs.\n*Beatnik Turtle on their album Sham Rock\n*Irish Rovers\n*Christy Moore on his album The Box Set 1964\u20132004\n*Donut Kings on their single Donut Kings Pub With No Beer\n*Schooner Fare on their album Finnegan's Wake\n*Woods Tea Company on their album The Wood's Tea Co. \u2013 Live!\n*Steve Benbow on his album Songs of Ireland\n*Roger McGuinn in his Folk Den series.\n*Dominic Behan on his album Down by the Liffeyside\n*Poxy Boggards on their albums Barley Legal and Bitter and Stout\n*Seamus Kennedy on his album By Popular Demand\n*The High Kings on their albums Memory Lane and Live in Ireland\nQuestion:\n\"What is the occupation of the title character in \"\"Finnegan's Wake\"\" by James Joyce?\"\nAnswer:\nHodcarrier\nPassage:\nFrame drum\nA frame drum is a drum that has a drumhead width greater than its depth. Usually the single drumhead is made of rawhide or man-made materials. Shells are traditionally constructed of bent wood (rosewood, oak, ash etc.) scarf jointed together; plywood and man-made materials are also used. Some frame drums have mechanical tuning and on many the drumhead is stretched and tacked in place. It is the earliest skin drum known to have existed. Examples are found in many places and cultures. It has been suggested  that they were also used to winnow grain.\n\nThe frame drum is one of the most ancient musical instruments; it is reputed to be the first drum to be invented. Frame drums are often constructed with a round, wooden frame. Metal rings or jingles may also be attached to the frame.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe \"Ride of the Valkyries\" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walk\u00fcre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the \"Ride\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Lohengrin, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walk\u00fcre opera, the \"Ride\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Br\u00fcnnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walk\u00fcre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \"Ride\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \"an utter indiscretion\" and forbade \"any such thing\".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. \u2013 requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\"  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe \"Ride\" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe \"Ride\" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the \"Ride\" is included in the recordings of the Walk\u00fcre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the Ride of the Valkyries\nAnswer:\nWagner's\nPassage:\nHow To Measure Horse Height - Cowboy Way\nMeasure Horse Height\nNote: Links with green  underlines are shopping links and will open in a new window\nHow To Measure Horse Height\nIt's easy to measure you horse's height accurately.\nTo determine how tall a horse is measure the horse, in inches, from  the ground in a straight line up to the highest point of the withers.  This is illustrated in the photo below by the yellow line.\nAbove: The height of a horse is properly measured, in inches,  from the ground to the highest point of the withers.\nFor the most accurate measurement the horse should be on firm, level  ground with its front feet even, or close to even.\nCalculating The Results\nAfter you have measured your horse you will need to  convert the results from inches to \"hands.\" Horse height is correctly referred  to by a unit of measurement  known as a \"hand.\" One hand is equal to four inches.\nThe gray mare in the photo above is 58 inches from the ground  to the top of her withers. When 58 is divided by 4, you have 14.5. The 14 is the  number of hands, and the .5 means another half of a hand, or another 2 inches. This means  she is 14 and one-half hands tall.\nCorrectly Writing And Speaking The Results\nThe correct way of writing \"14 and one-half hands\" is to write \"14.2\". It is not correct to write it as \"14.5\". When  correctly written, the number before the period is the  number of hands, and the number after the period is the remaining number of   inches. The number after the period should NOT stand for a fraction. Horseman  usually say a measurement like this one out loud as \"fourteen two\" or \"fourteen  and a half.\"\nA Few Examples\nBelow are a few examples of how to correctly   write down a horse's height. Remember, the number in front of the period is for  hands and the number after the period is the remaining inches.\n15 - This is a correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.0 - Another correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.1 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 1  inch tall\n15.2 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 2  inches tall\n15.3 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 3  inches tall\n15.4 - Wrong! This means that a horse is 15 hands, 4 inches tall. Since  a hand is equal to four inches, this horse is actually 16 hands tall.\n15.5 - Wrong again! Some people incorrectly use the number after the  period to stand for fractions of a hand, but it should stand for inches. So,  some people write \"15.5\" to mean 15 and a half hands, but this should  correctly be written as \"15.2\".\nIf you like, you can add \"hh\" to a measurement, as in \"15.1hh\".  The \"hh\" stands for \"hands high.\"\nHorse Measuring Devices\nThere are measuring devices on the market for horses  that have hand and inches measurements marked on them. Some devices are rigid  poles with short cross bars toward the top that can be raised or lowered to rest on a  horse's withers. These are very handy and give accurate measurements easily.\nAnother common device is a horse height/weight tape , which is a special tape measure  with hands and inches marked on it. These are inexpensive and are accurate if the person doing the measuring  makes sure to run the tape straight up  and down, and to read the measurement at a level angle.\nWhere Did \"Hands\" Come From?\nAs stated above, a horse's height is measured in  hands. The origin of measuring a horse this way is very old, but easy to  understand. In days long ago people did not have the common measuring devices  (like tape measures, etc.) that we do today. To measure a horse, they used what  was handy (no pun intended): Their hands. At various times in history and in  different locales a \"hand\" was defined as the with of a person's hand  using the fingers only, the width of a person's hand using the fingers and the thumb, the  height of a clenched fist, and possibly others. Somewhere along the way, the  measuring unit of a hand was standardized to mean four inches. Though the  origins are ancient, a hand is still the unit of measurement for horses that  modern horse owners use today.\nQuestion:\nHorses are measured in 'hands', what is the equivalent of a hand in inches?\nAnswer:\nfour  distance\nPassage:\nPrivate Walker\nPrivate Joe Walker is a fictional black market spiv (or Wholesales Supplier, as he politely puts it) and Home Guard platoon member portrayed by actor James Beck on the BBC television sitcom Dad's Army. James Beck died suddenly in 1973, and is featured in just under three-quarters of the episodes. Despite this, the character of Walker was possibly one of the most prominent and popular in the show. Following his character's departure (Walker was last mentioned in the episode \"The Recruit\", although he does not appear in this episode) the series attempted to replace him with a war reporter called Private Cheeseman (played by Talfryn Thomas) who had made a previous cameo appearance in My British Buddy.\n\nPersonality\n\nWalker was the second youngest member of the platoon, the youngest being Pike. A pleasant and amiable (if slightly shifty) personality, Walker is nevertheless a constant thorn in Mainwaring's side as he doesn't share his idealism and makes cheeky and witty interruptions during his serious lectures. However, despite this he is good-natured and loyal to his commanding officer and platoon comrades, and is a valuable asset to the platoon, due to his many \"business\" connections and his ability to mysteriously conjure up almost anything that is rationed or no longer in the shops due to the War - and he will also have it in vast supply (for a price). \n\nPrivate Walker also demonstrates keen improvisational skills and cunning; as a result, owing to these attributes and his cheerful willingness to use tactics that Mainwaring might not consider to be 'cricket', he is usually responsible for getting the platoon out of many of the scrapes that they find themselves in. He is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to make a few bob, and can normally be found trying to sell such things as petrol coupons and black market foodstuffs to his platoon comrades, usually at high prices and from dubious sources. His \"business\" activities are not limited to just the members of the platoon, or indeed even to the residents of Walmington-on-Sea, as he has often made reference to acquiring \"essential supplies\" for members of the rival Eastgate platoon and various influential people, military or civilian; at one point, he offers to provide \"a couple of bottles of scotch\" to a high-ranking GHQ officer, when Mainwaring briefly loses his command of the platoon. Indeed, the only time Walker can't find a buyer for his \"essential supplies\" is when the American Army arrives at Walmington-on-Sea (with the comparatively well-off American troops already having plenty of liquor and other items normally provided by Walker).\n\nWalker considers himself a ladies' man, and his recurring girlfriend Shirley (played by Wendy Richard) is seen in several episodes. In the platoon, he mostly associates with Jones, Pike and Frazer. Despite merely being a Private, Walker clearly has some form of influence over the platoon, not least due to his black-market dealings which have got them out of (and into) numerous scrapes. Moreover, when Frazer is temporarily promoted to Captain in If the Cap Fits..., he selects Walker as his Sergeant. Walker has friendly relationships with all the men in the platoon, jokingly referring to the Scottish Frazer as \"Taffy\", and occasionally calling Jones a \"silly old duffer\" when they have the odd disagreement.\n\nHe is supposedly allergic to corned beef, and this is given as the reason why he has not been called up for the regular army, although it is generally assumed that he has found a way to dodge the rules. This allergy was exposed in the episode The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker, which has since been lost from the BBC's archives. He was conscripted, only to be discharged when it was found that corned beef fritters were the only rations left for the soldiers to eat.  Although a superficially implausible explanation for Walker's discharge it is actually possible to have an [http://www.livestrong.com/article/525254-corned-beef-allergy/ allergy to certain types of corned beef] but not beef itself as a result of various antioxidants that may be used in the curing process.\n\nWalker's final appearance was in the episode Things That Go Bump in the Night, where the platoon spent the night in a mysterious house. In fact he is only seen in the location shots, filmed some time before the studio recording. Beck was ill for the recordings of both this episode and the next, The Recruit, in which the story suggested that Walker had \"gone to the smoke\" (a slang term for London) to \"do a deal\". After Beck's death, Walker was never mentioned in the show (though the character survived the war; the very first episode begins with a scene set in 1968, as Mainwaring, now an alderman, launches his \"I'm Backing Britain\" campaign - Walker is seen as one of the town worthies present at the launch).\n \nIn the radio adaptations of the series, Graham Stark stood in until Larry Martyn gave his portrayal of Walker for subsequent shows. In 1976 John Bardon played Walker in the stage production. Scriptwriter Jimmy Perry originally intended to play the part himself, but was advised against it by his co-writer David Croft. Walker was based on a spiv character created and performed by British comedian and actor Arthur English (English was in the controversial episode Absent Friends and starred in Are You Being Served?).\nQuestion:\nWho played Private Joe Walker in Dad\u2019s Army?\nAnswer:\nJimmy Beck\nPassage:\nJenny Pitman\nJenny Pitman (born 11 June 1946ISBN 1-85225-254-5 \"Jenny Pitman, The Autobiography\" ) is a former British racehorse trainer and author. She became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere won the race in 1983. She went on to win a second Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995. Following her retirement from horse training in 1998 she became a writer of novels, principally with a racing theme.\n\nChildhood\n\nPitman was born as Jenny Harvey on her family's farm near Hoby, Leicestershire, one of seven children. She was brought up assisting in manual farm work, where horse powered equipment was a novelty, and learned to ride a pony \"so young that being on horseback seemed as natural as walking\". In 1957 she left the Hoby village school to attend Sarson Secondary Modern Girls' School in Melton Mowbray. She sustained a fractured skull when a showjumping pole fell on her head during a gymkhana at Syston, it was many months before resultant convulsions were diagnosed. At the age of 14, she obtained a weekend and school holiday job at Brooksby Grange horse racing yard.\n\nPitman left school two weeks before her 15th birthday, taking up a position as a stable girl, at Brooksby Grange for a weekly wage of \u00a33\u00a04s\u00a05d. Her first overnight stop was at Manchester where her filly, Star Princess, won the 1962 Diomedes Handicap. Two years later she changed jobs, moving to a stable in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, the first time she had lived away from her Leicestershire home.\n\nAdult life\n\nPitman worked at Bishop's Cleeve for two years. One day there, she was returning from a workout on the local gallops when her horse was spooked by a cyclist travelling around a corner too fast and on the wrong side of the road. The cyclist in question was jockey Richard Pitman. Jenny's initial reaction to Richard was unfavourable, but later, when Richard obtained a job in Lambourn at Fred Winter's training stables 50 mi from Bishop's Cleeve, Jenny was persuaded to apply for a job in Lambourn with Major Champneys at Church Farm Stables. She moved in 1964.\n\nAged 19, she married Richard Pitman. In August 1966, their son Mark Pitman was born and Jenny became a full-time housewife. Son Paul was born in October 1967. In the next winter, missing the world of horses, they bought a 6 acre property with stables and an indoor school in Hinton Parva to provide a service to other trainers for recuperating injured horses. In 'Parva Stud', the family struggled to live in an unheated caravan. By the end of 1968 Pitman had 8 horses at the yard. With Richard's second place prize from the 1969 Grand National, the Pitmans were able to commission a bungalow on the premises to escape the poor condition caravan. In 1969 she employed a 'lad' to assist at the yard, Melvyn Saddler, who became her right-hand man as her success grew.\n\nIn February 1974, Pitman was able to enter a horse she had trained in her first point-to-point race. Ridden by stable lad Bryan Smart, Road Race didn't figure in the race betting, but amazingly managed to pass the favourite after the last fence to win.\n\nIn 1977 Jenny and Richard divorced and Jenny left Wiltshire and moved to Lambourn, Berkshire. She is now married to businessman, David Stait. In 1975 she was successful in getting her first horse training licence and her first winner came in the very same year.\n\nIn 1983 she became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere was the victor.  She was to win one other Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995 although her horse Esha Ness was first past the post in the void National of 1993. \n \nIn 1998 she was awarded the OBE for services to horseracing  and subsequently retired from training racehorses in 1999, handing over the reins to son, Mark. Pitman was the first winner of the Helen Rollason award at the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year Awards.\n\nAlthough still seen at the races, she is now a prolific writer of novels, principally with a racing spin. \n\nA survivor of thyroid cancer, she is a patron of the British Thyroid Foundation.\nQuestion:\nJenny Pitman was the trainer of which 1995 Grand National winning horse?\nAnswer:\nRoyal Athlete\nPassage:\nDunkery Hill\nDunkery Beacon at the summit of Dunkery Hill is the highest point on Exmoor and in Somerset, England. It is also the highest point in southern England outside of Dartmoor.\n\nThe sandstone hill rises to 1705 ft and provides views over the surrounding moorland, the Bristol Channel and hills up to 86 mi away. The site has been visited by humans since the Bronze Age, and contains several burial mounds in the form of cairns and bowl barrows. Sweetworthy on the lower slopes is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures and a deserted medieval settlement. The hill is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and National nature reserve. It was in private ownership until the 20th century, when it was donated to the National Trust by Sir Thomas Acland, Colonel Wiggin and Allan Hughes; a stone cairn was erected at the summit to commemorate the event.\n\nLocation\n\nDunkery is composed of Middle Devonian sedimentary rock, () known as the Hangman Sandstone Formation.  This supports acidic soils. \nThe ridge along the top of the hill is  long.\n\nAt 1705 ft ordnance datum (OD), the mean height above sea level,  Dunkery Beacon is the highest natural point in Somerset,  although the tip of the Mendip TV Mast is higher at  OD. Dunkery is ranked 23rd in the UK in terms of dominance and is a Marilyn, meaning that it is a peak with 150 m or more of relative height. The nearest higher hill is Yes Tor, 37 mi away. John Fry, a character in R. D. Blackmore's 1869 novel Lorna Doone, calls it the \"haighest place of Hexmoor\". \n\nDunkery lies just 4 mi from the Bristol Channel at Porlock. The shortest route of ascent goes from the car park at Dunkery Gate, and is just  long. There are extensive views from the summit, from where the Bristol and English Channel coasts, the Brecon Beacons including Pen Y Fan, Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor, the Severn Bridges and Cleeve Hill 86 mi away in Gloucestershire are visible. \n\nHistory\n\nDunkery Hill was part of the \"Royal Forest of Exmoor\", established by Henry II according to the late 13th-century Hundred Rolls. There has been some debate about the origin of the name \"Dunkery\" and its predecessors \"Duncrey\" and \"Dunnecray\".  Eilert Ekwall suggests that it comes from the Welsh din meaning hillfort and creic or creag meaning rock.  \n\nThere are several Bronze Age burial mounds at or near the summit.  Two of the largest are Joaney How and Robin How, which have been damaged over many years, although plans have been made to restore and protect them.  \"How\" comes from the Norse for burial mound.  Joaney How on the northern slope, is more than 22 m in diameter.   On the southeastern slopes are four more cairns,  and there are a further two round cairns 390 m and 420 m southeast of Rex Stile Head.  In addition to the cairns are barrows, which also date from the Bronze Age. One bowl barrow on the southeastern spur of the Chains is  in diameter.  A circular funerary stone mound 850 m north of Dunkery Bridge, which is a  walk from the summit, dates from the Neolithic or Bronze Age. It is approximately  high and 14 m in diameter.  \n\nSweetworthy, on Dunkery Hill's north-facing slope, is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures;   one has a single rampart and external ditch, enclosing .  The rampart is still visible, and the ditch on the east side is used as a trackway.   There was a defended settlement above the main site.  It is also the site of a deserted medieval settlement, which has been designated an ancient monument.   It has been added to the Heritage at Risk register because of the vulnerability to plant growth. \n\nIn 1918 Sir Thomas Acland leased part of the land.along with a large part of the Holnicote Estate, for 500 years. Dunkery Hill was put up for sale in 1928. Labour Party activist and Member of Parliament Margaret Bondfield asked in the House of Commons if the government was willing to have it designated an ancient monument, to preserve it for future generations. She received the reply that although the government was agreeable to having the hill listed there were no funds available for its purchase;  the beacon and surrounding mounds were subsequently designated an ancient monument.  The beacon itself, and 960 acre of surrounding land, was donated in 1932 by Colonel W.W. Wiggin. A further 945 acre of nearby land was donated in 1934 by Mrs Hughes in memory of her husband Alan Hughes of Lynch Allerford, Minehead. The donations were commemorated in 1935 with an event when a plaque was attached to the summit memorial cairn. Further parts of the Holnicote Estate, which includes other land donated by the Acland family and others, was given in subsequent years.   \n\nEcology\n\nThe site is part of the North Exmoor Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), part of the Dunkery & Horner Woods National Nature Reserve  and part of the Exmoor Coastal Heaths Special Area of Conservation. \n\nThe hill is blanketed in heather, which gives it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, as well as some unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.\nQuestion:\nDunkery Beacon is the highest point in which English National Park?\nAnswer:\nExmoor National Park\nPassage:\nLicence to Kill (soundtrack)\nThe soundtrack to Licence to Kill, the 16th James Bond film of the same name, was released by MCA Records in 1989.\n\nBecause the usual James Bond composer John Barry (who had scored almost every film from From Russia with Love onwards) was not available at the time as he was undergoing throat surgery, the soundtrack's more upbeat and suspenseful score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen.\n\nInitially Eric Clapton and Vic Flick were asked to write and perform the theme song to Licence to Kill. The theme was said to have been a new version based on the James Bond Theme. The guitar riff heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Flick. \n\nThe prospect, however, fell apart and Gladys Knight's song and performance was chosen, later becoming a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. The song was composed by Narada Michael Walden, Jeffrey Cohen and Walter Afanasieff, based on the \"horn line\" from Goldfinger, which required royalty payments to the original writers.  At five-minutes twelve seconds it is the longest Bond theme. The music video of \"Licence to Kill\" was directed by Daniel Kleinman, who later took over the reins of title designer from Maurice Binder for the 1995 Bond film, GoldenEye.\n\nAll the instrumental tracks are amalgams of various sequences and musical cues from the film rather than straight score excerpts. The end credits of the film feature the song \"If You Asked Me To\" sung by Patti LaBelle. Though the song was a top ten R&B charter and a minor pop hit for LaBelle, in 1992, the song was covered by and became a much bigger hit for singer C\u00e9line Dion. The track \"Wedding Party\", used during the wedding of Felix Leiter to Della Churchill, makes reference to the track \"Jump Up\" from the first Bond film, Dr. No.\n\nTrack listing\n\n# \"Licence to Kill\" \u2013 Gladys Knight\n# \"Wedding Party\" \u2013 Ivory\n# \"Dirty Love\" \u2013 Tim Feehan\n# \"Pam\"\n# \"If You Asked Me To\" \u2013 Patti LaBelle\n# \"James & Felix on Their Way to Church\"contains the James Bond Theme, originally composed for the Dr. No soundtrack\n# \"His Funny Valentine\"\n# \"Sanchez Is in the Bahamas/Shark Fishing\"\n# \"Ninja\"\n# \"Licence Revoked\"\nQuestion:\nCan you name the singer of the title track for '1989 - Licence to Kill'?\nAnswer:\nGladys Knight\nPassage:\nHouses of Parliament | Monet Gallery\nHouses of Parliament | Monet Gallery\nMonet \u2022 Paintings \u2022 Houses of Parliament\nHouses of Parliament\nClaude Monet first went to London in 1870 to escape the Franco-Prussian War. While there he would have seen and been inspired by painters like Turner and began to develop his use of bright colors that would become a defining element of Impressionist painting.\nAfter traveling and moving to Giverny, where he would have his famous gardens, Monet returned to London in 1899 and began work on a series of paintings depicting the Palace of Westminster, also called The House of Parliament, or simply Parliament. His Houses of Parliament series contains 19 canvases all exactly the same size and depicting the same scene from the same vantage point.\nStarting in February 1900, Monet began painting a view of Parliament from across the river Thames. From a terrace on the second floor of the St. Thomas Hospital, Monet could see the Houses of Parliament, including Big Ben, sitting on the edge of the river. In each canvas Parliament is on the right, with water to the left and in front and sky above. As in previous works, these paintings are studies in showing the changing landscape. Because his subject, the light, changes so quickly Monet would sketch out the\nbuilding of Parliament before hand and then paint, adding the color and detail, while looking out his terrace over the river.\nIn previous Series paintings, Haystacks and Rouen Cathedral , Monet showed the effect light and the atmosphere has on objects. While the Parliament series has the building, Westminster Palace is so distorted and obscured by the fog and smog it becomes secondary as the subject. For the Parliament series, we are not just seeing the effect of light on objects we see, Monet is showing the effect of light on the atmosphere itself. Even today London is famous for its fog, and in the 1880\u2019s the Fog was at its peak being heavy and frequent. By 1900, the fog had been decreasing, but was still apparent and being thickened by the smog a result of London\u2019s growing industry.\nThroughout the series of paintings Monet shows the river change from blue and green to bright orange and red lit by the afternoon sun. Monet\u2019s brushstrokes create depth and layers within the fog showing the thickness and weight of the atmosphere. In one painting Parlement, coucher du soleil, 1902, the sun is setting behind the clouds creating highlights and shadows high within the sky turning the river into a mirror reflecting Westminster Palace. In another Houses of Parliament, stormy sky, 1904, almost the entire canvas is orange; as the storm, lit by the high sun, hangs over London darkening Parliament. A few of his canvases show the disc of the sun, visible through the fog and reflecting on the water, while others show a dark sky, the sun hidden behind a thick fog.\nMonet made two trips to London to work on the Houses of Parliament series, in 1900 and 1901. While he painted them from the St. Thomas Hospital, he returned to France with canvases and worked on them for the next three years not showing them until 1904. It may be thought by some viewers that their apparent lack of detail and the years spent working on them by memory may result in a different scene than what he saw, but modern researchers have been able to analyze his works showing his accuracy. By tracing known astrological patterns and solar geometry, not only have scholars been able to pinpoint the exact room and terrace he was painting from, they know the precise times. In fact, his depictions are so accurate that some study them to determine the elements that made up the fog and smog, and changes in the climate by his use of color.\nVisit Monet\nQuestion:\nWhich artist used a terrace at St Thomas' Hospital as a vantage point for his series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament?\nAnswer:\nClaude-Oscar Monet\n\n\nPassage:\nFontanelle\nA fontanelle (or fontanel) (colloquially, soft spot) is an anatomical feature of the infant human skull comprising any of the soft membranous gaps (sutures) between the cranial bones that make up the calvaria of a fetus or an infant. Fontanelles allow for rapid stretching and deformation of the neurocranium as the brain expands faster than the surrounding bone can grow. Premature complete ossification of the sutures is called craniosynostosis.\n\nDuring infancy, the anterior fontanelle is known as the bregma.\n\nStructure\n\nThe skull of a newborn consists of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth.\n\n* Posterior fontanelle is triangle-shaped. It lies at the junction between the sagittal suture and lambdoid suture. At birth, the skull features a small posterior fontanelle with an open area covered by a tough membrane, where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone (at the lambda). The posterior fontanelles ossify within 2 or 3 months of birth. This is called intramembranous ossification.  The mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue.\n* Anterior fontanelle is a diamond-shaped membrane-filled space located between the two frontal and two parietal bones of the developing fetal skull. It persists until approximately 18 months after birth. It is at the junction of the coronal suture and sagittal suture. The fetal anterior fontanelle may be palpated until 18 months. In cleidocranial dysostosis, however, it is often late in closing or may never close.  Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle.\n* Two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head, more anteriorly the sphenoidal or anterolateral fontanelle (between the sphenoid, parietal, temporal, and frontal bones) and more posteriorly the mastoid or posterolateral fontanelle (between the temporal, occipital, and parietal bones).\nDuring birth, fontanelles enable the bony plates of the skull to flex, allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal. The ossification of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close over by 9 to 18 months.  The sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of life. The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium. Other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles, the mastoid fontanelle and the sphenoidal fontanelle are also significant.\n\nClosure\n\nIn humans, the sequence of fontanelle closure is as follows:\n# The posterior fontanelle generally closes 8\u201312 weeks after birth;\n# The sphenoidal fontanelle is the next to close around 6 months after birth;\n# The mastoid fontanelle closes next from 6 to 18 months after birth; and\n# The anterior fontanelle is generally the last to close between 12\u201318 months.\n\nClinical significance\n\nThe fontanelle may pulsate, and although the precise cause of this is not known, it is perfectly normal and seems to echo the heartbeat, perhaps via the arterial pulse within the brain vasculature, or in the meninges. This pulsating action is how the soft spot got its name \u2013 fontanelle is borrowed from the old French word fontenele, which is a diminutive of fontaine, meaning \"spring\". It is assumed that the term spring is used because of the analogy of the dent in a rock or earth where a spring arises. \n\nParents may worry that their infant may be more prone to injury at the fontanelles. In fact, although they may colloquially be called \"soft-spots\", the membrane covering the fontanelles is extremely tough and difficult to penetrate.\n\nFontanelles allow the infant brain to be imaged using ultrasonography. Once they are closed, most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging, because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier.\n\nDisease\n\nFontanelles \u2013 bulging\n\nA very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure. Increased cranial pressure in infants may cause the fontanelles to bulge or the head to begin to enlarge abnormally.  It can occur due to:\n* Encephalitis \u2013 swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections\n* Hydrocephalus \u2013 a buildup of fluid inside the skull\n* Meningitis\u2014infection of the membranes covering the brain\n\nFontanelles \u2013 sunken\n\nA sunken (also called \"depressed\") fontanelle indicates dehydration or malnutrition. \n\nFontanelles \u2013 enlarged\n\nThe fontanelles may be enlarged, may be slow to close or may never close most commonly due to causes like: \n* Down syndrome\n* Hydrocephalus\n* Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)\n* Premature birth\n\nRarer causes include:\n* Achondroplasia\n* Apert syndrome\n* Cleidocranial dysostosis\n* Congenital rubella\n* Neonatal hypothyroidism\n* Osteogenesis imperfecta\n* Rickets\n\nIn other animals\n\nIn apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth. In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age.\n\nIn dogs\n\nNot all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus. In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth, but instead will close slowly over a three- to six-month period. Occasionally these bones fail to close, but the dog is still healthy. In these cases, however, the dog's owners need to be very careful, since any injury or bumps to the animal's head could cause significant brain damage, as well as conditions like epilepsy.\n\nAdditional images\n\n File:Fontanelle.png|Fontanelle.\n File:Anterior fontanelle.jpg|Anterior fontanelle.\n File:Sutures from top.png|Cranial sutures shown from top of head.\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the soft spots on a baby's head which, during birth, enable the bony plates of the skull to flex allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal?\nAnswer:\n", "input": "Passage:\nFontanelle\nA fontanelle (or fontanel) (colloquially, soft spot) is an anatomical feature of the infant human skull comprising any of the soft membranous gaps (sutures) between the cranial bones that make up the calvaria of a fetus or an infant.

Once they are closed, most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging, because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier.\n\nDisease\n\nFontanelles \u2013 bulging\n\nA very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure. Increased cranial pressure in infants may cause the fontanelles to bulge or the head to begin to enlarge abnormally.  It can occur due to:\n* Encephalitis \u2013 swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections\n* Hydrocephalus \u2013 a buildup of fluid inside the skull\n* Meningitis\u2014infection of the membranes covering the brain\n\nFontanelles \u2013 sunken\n\nA sunken (also called \"depressed\") fontanelle indicates dehydration or malnutrition. \n\nFontanelles \u2013 enlarged\n\nThe fontanelles may be enlarged, may be slow to close or may never close most commonly due to causes like: \n* Down syndrome\n* Hydrocephalus\n* Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)\n* Premature birth\n\nRarer causes include:\n* Achondroplasia\n* Apert syndrome\n* Cleidocranial dysostosis\n* Congenital rubella\n* Neonatal hypothyroidism\n* Osteogenesis imperfecta\n* Rickets\n\nIn other animals\n\nIn apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth. In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age.\n\nIn dogs\n\nNot all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus. In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth, but instead will close slowly over a three- to six-month period. Occasionally these bones fail to close, but the dog is still healthy. In these cases, however, the dog's owners need to be very careful, since any injury or bumps to the animal's head could cause significant brain damage, as well as conditions like epilepsy.\n\nAdditional images\n\n File:Fontanelle.png|Fontanelle.\n File:Anterior fontanelle.jpg|Anterior fontanelle.\n File:Sutures from top.png|Cranial sutures shown from top of head.\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the soft spots on a baby's head which, during birth, enable the bony plates of the skull to flex allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe \"Ride of the Valkyries\" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walk\u00fcre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the \"Ride\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Lohengrin, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walk\u00fcre opera, the \"Ride\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Br\u00fcnnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walk\u00fcre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \"Ride\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \"an utter indiscretion\" and forbade \"any such thing\".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. \u2013 requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\"  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe \"Ride\" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe \"Ride\" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the \"Ride\" is included in the recordings of the Walk\u00fcre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the Ride of the Valkyries\nAnswer:\nWagner's\nPassage:\nHow To Measure Horse Height - Cowboy Way\nMeasure Horse Height\nNote: Links with green  underlines are shopping links and will open in a new window\nHow To Measure Horse Height\nIt's easy to measure you horse's height accurately.\nTo determine how tall a horse is measure the horse, in inches, from  the ground in a straight line up to the highest point of the withers.  This is illustrated in the photo below by the yellow line.\nAbove: The height of a horse is properly measured, in inches,  from the ground to the highest point of the withers.\nFor the most accurate measurement the horse should be on firm, level  ground with its front feet even, or close to even.\nCalculating The Results\nAfter you have measured your horse you will need to  convert the results from inches to \"hands.\" Horse height is correctly referred  to by a unit of measurement  known as a \"hand.\" One hand is equal to four inches.\nThe gray mare in the photo above is 58 inches from the ground  to the top of her withers. When 58 is divided by 4, you have 14.5. The 14 is the  number of hands, and the .5 means another half of a hand, or another 2 inches. This means  she is 14 and one-half hands tall.\nCorrectly Writing And Speaking The Results\nThe correct way of writing \"14 and one-half hands\" is to write \"14.2\". It is not correct to write it as \"14.5\". When  correctly written, the number before the period is the  number of hands, and the number after the period is the remaining number of   inches. The number after the period should NOT stand for a fraction. Horseman  usually say a measurement like this one out loud as \"fourteen two\" or \"fourteen  and a half.\"\nA Few Examples\nBelow are a few examples of how to correctly   write down a horse's height. Remember, the number in front of the period is for  hands and the number after the period is the remaining inches.\n15 - This is a correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.0 - Another correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.1 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 1  inch tall\n15.2 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 2  inches tall\n15.3 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 3  inches tall\n15.4 - Wrong! This means that a horse is 15 hands, 4 inches tall. Since  a hand is equal to four inches, this horse is actually 16 hands tall.\n15.5 - Wrong again! Some people incorrectly use the number after the  period to stand for fractions of a hand, but it should stand for inches. So,  some people write \"15.5\" to mean 15 and a half hands, but this should  correctly be written as \"15.2\".\nIf you like, you can add \"hh\" to a measurement, as in \"15.1hh\".  The \"hh\" stands for \"hands high.\"\nHorse Measuring Devices\nThere are measuring devices on the market for horses  that have hand and inches measurements marked on them. Some devices are rigid  poles with short cross bars toward the top that can be raised or lowered to rest on a  horse's withers. These are very handy and give accurate measurements easily.\nAnother common device is a horse height/weight tape , which is a special tape measure  with hands and inches marked on it. These are inexpensive and are accurate if the person doing the measuring  makes sure to run the tape straight up  and down, and to read the measurement at a level angle.\nWhere Did \"Hands\" Come From?\nAs stated above, a horse's height is measured in  hands. The origin of measuring a horse this way is very old, but easy to  understand. In days long ago people did not have the common measuring devices  (like tape measures, etc.) that we do today. To measure a horse, they used what  was handy (no pun intended): Their hands. At various times in history and in  different locales a \"hand\" was defined as the with of a person's hand  using the fingers only, the width of a person's hand using the fingers and the thumb, the  height of a clenched fist, and possibly others. Somewhere along the way, the  measuring unit of a hand was standardized to mean four inches. Though the  origins are ancient, a hand is still the unit of measurement for horses that  modern horse owners use today.\nQuestion:\nHorses are measured in 'hands', what is the equivalent of a hand in inches?\nAnswer:\nfour  distance\nPassage:\nPrivate Walker\nPrivate Joe Walker is a fictional black market spiv (or Wholesales Supplier, as he politely puts it) and Home Guard platoon member portrayed by actor James Beck on the BBC television sitcom Dad's Army. James Beck died suddenly in 1973, and is featured in just under three-quarters of the episodes. Despite this, the character of Walker was possibly one of the most prominent and popular in the show. Following his character's departure (Walker was last mentioned in the episode \"The Recruit\", although he does not appear in this episode) the series attempted to replace him with a war reporter called Private Cheeseman (played by Talfryn Thomas) who had made a previous cameo appearance in My British Buddy.\n\nPersonality\n\nWalker was the second youngest member of the platoon, the youngest being Pike. A pleasant and amiable (if slightly shifty) personality, Walker is nevertheless a constant thorn in Mainwaring's side as he doesn't share his idealism and makes cheeky and witty interruptions during his serious lectures. However, despite this he is good-natured and loyal to his commanding officer and platoon comrades, and is a valuable asset to the platoon, due to his many \"business\" connections and his ability to mysteriously conjure up almost anything that is rationed or no longer in the shops due to the War - and he will also have it in vast supply (for a price). \n\nPrivate Walker also demonstrates keen improvisational skills and cunning; as a result, owing to these attributes and his cheerful willingness to use tactics that Mainwaring might not consider to be 'cricket', he is usually responsible for getting the platoon out of many of the scrapes that they find themselves in. He is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to make a few bob, and can normally be found trying to sell such things as petrol coupons and black market foodstuffs to his platoon comrades, usually at high prices and from dubious sources. His \"business\" activities are not limited to just the members of the platoon, or indeed even to the residents of Walmington-on-Sea, as he has often made reference to acquiring \"essential supplies\" for members of the rival Eastgate platoon and various influential people, military or civilian; at one point, he offers to provide \"a couple of bottles of scotch\" to a high-ranking GHQ officer, when Mainwaring briefly loses his command of the platoon. Indeed, the only time Walker can't find a buyer for his \"essential supplies\" is when the American Army arrives at Walmington-on-Sea (with the comparatively well-off American troops already having plenty of liquor and other items normally provided by Walker).\n\nWalker considers himself a ladies' man, and his recurring girlfriend Shirley (played by Wendy Richard) is seen in several episodes. In the platoon, he mostly associates with Jones, Pike and Frazer. Despite merely being a Private, Walker clearly has some form of influence over the platoon, not least due to his black-market dealings which have got them out of (and into) numerous scrapes. Moreover, when Frazer is temporarily promoted to Captain in If the Cap Fits..., he selects Walker as his Sergeant. Walker has friendly relationships with all the men in the platoon, jokingly referring to the Scottish Frazer as \"Taffy\", and occasionally calling Jones a \"silly old duffer\" when they have the odd disagreement.\n\nHe is supposedly allergic to corned beef, and this is given as the reason why he has not been called up for the regular army, although it is generally assumed that he has found a way to dodge the rules. This allergy was exposed in the episode The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker, which has since been lost from the BBC's archives. He was conscripted, only to be discharged when it was found that corned beef fritters were the only rations left for the soldiers to eat.  Although a superficially implausible explanation for Walker's discharge it is actually possible to have an [http://www.livestrong.com/article/525254-corned-beef-allergy/ allergy to certain types of corned beef] but not beef itself as a result of various antioxidants that may be used in the curing process.\n\nWalker's final appearance was in the episode Things That Go Bump in the Night, where the platoon spent the night in a mysterious house. In fact he is only seen in the location shots, filmed some time before the studio recording. Beck was ill for the recordings of both this episode and the next, The Recruit, in which the story suggested that Walker had \"gone to the smoke\" (a slang term for London) to \"do a deal\". After Beck's death, Walker was never mentioned in the show (though the character survived the war; the very first episode begins with a scene set in 1968, as Mainwaring, now an alderman, launches his \"I'm Backing Britain\" campaign - Walker is seen as one of the town worthies present at the launch).\n \nIn the radio adaptations of the series, Graham Stark stood in until Larry Martyn gave his portrayal of Walker for subsequent shows. In 1976 John Bardon played Walker in the stage production. Scriptwriter Jimmy Perry originally intended to play the part himself, but was advised against it by his co-writer David Croft. Walker was based on a spiv character created and performed by British comedian and actor Arthur English (English was in the controversial episode Absent Friends and starred in Are You Being Served?).\nQuestion:\nWho played Private Joe Walker in Dad\u2019s Army?\nAnswer:\nJimmy Beck\nPassage:\nJenny Pitman\nJenny Pitman (born 11 June 1946ISBN 1-85225-254-5 \"Jenny Pitman, The Autobiography\" ) is a former British racehorse trainer and author. She became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere won the race in 1983. She went on to win a second Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995. Following her retirement from horse training in 1998 she became a writer of novels, principally with a racing theme.\n\nChildhood\n\nPitman was born as Jenny Harvey on her family's farm near Hoby, Leicestershire, one of seven children. She was brought up assisting in manual farm work, where horse powered equipment was a novelty, and learned to ride a pony \"so young that being on horseback seemed as natural as walking\". In 1957 she left the Hoby village school to attend Sarson Secondary Modern Girls' School in Melton Mowbray. She sustained a fractured skull when a showjumping pole fell on her head during a gymkhana at Syston, it was many months before resultant convulsions were diagnosed. At the age of 14, she obtained a weekend and school holiday job at Brooksby Grange horse racing yard.\n\nPitman left school two weeks before her 15th birthday, taking up a position as a stable girl, at Brooksby Grange for a weekly wage of \u00a33\u00a04s\u00a05d. Her first overnight stop was at Manchester where her filly, Star Princess, won the 1962 Diomedes Handicap. Two years later she changed jobs, moving to a stable in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, the first time she had lived away from her Leicestershire home.\n\nAdult life\n\nPitman worked at Bishop's Cleeve for two years. One day there, she was returning from a workout on the local gallops when her horse was spooked by a cyclist travelling around a corner too fast and on the wrong side of the road. The cyclist in question was jockey Richard Pitman. Jenny's initial reaction to Richard was unfavourable, but later, when Richard obtained a job in Lambourn at Fred Winter's training stables 50 mi from Bishop's Cleeve, Jenny was persuaded to apply for a job in Lambourn with Major Champneys at Church Farm Stables. She moved in 1964.\n\nAged 19, she married Richard Pitman. In August 1966, their son Mark Pitman was born and Jenny became a full-time housewife. Son Paul was born in October 1967. In the next winter, missing the world of horses, they bought a 6 acre property with stables and an indoor school in Hinton Parva to provide a service to other trainers for recuperating injured horses. In 'Parva Stud', the family struggled to live in an unheated caravan. By the end of 1968 Pitman had 8 horses at the yard. With Richard's second place prize from the 1969 Grand National, the Pitmans were able to commission a bungalow on the premises to escape the poor condition caravan. In 1969 she employed a 'lad' to assist at the yard, Melvyn Saddler, who became her right-hand man as her success grew.\n\nIn February 1974, Pitman was able to enter a horse she had trained in her first point-to-point race. Ridden by stable lad Bryan Smart, Road Race didn't figure in the race betting, but amazingly managed to pass the favourite after the last fence to win.\n\nIn 1977 Jenny and Richard divorced and Jenny left Wiltshire and moved to Lambourn, Berkshire. She is now married to businessman, David Stait. In 1975 she was successful in getting her first horse training licence and her first winner came in the very same year.\n\nIn 1983 she became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere was the victor.  She was to win one other Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995 although her horse Esha Ness was first past the post in the void National of 1993. \n \nIn 1998 she was awarded the OBE for services to horseracing  and subsequently retired from training racehorses in 1999, handing over the reins to son, Mark. Pitman was the first winner of the Helen Rollason award at the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year Awards.\n\nAlthough still seen at the races, she is now a prolific writer of novels, principally with a racing spin. \n\nA survivor of thyroid cancer, she is a patron of the British Thyroid Foundation.\nQuestion:\nJenny Pitman was the trainer of which 1995 Grand National winning horse?\nAnswer:\nRoyal Athlete\nPassage:\nDunkery Hill\nDunkery Beacon at the summit of Dunkery Hill is the highest point on Exmoor and in Somerset, England. It is also the highest point in southern England outside of Dartmoor.\n\nThe sandstone hill rises to 1705 ft and provides views over the surrounding moorland, the Bristol Channel and hills up to 86 mi away. The site has been visited by humans since the Bronze Age, and contains several burial mounds in the form of cairns and bowl barrows. Sweetworthy on the lower slopes is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures and a deserted medieval settlement. The hill is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and National nature reserve. It was in private ownership until the 20th century, when it was donated to the National Trust by Sir Thomas Acland, Colonel Wiggin and Allan Hughes; a stone cairn was erected at the summit to commemorate the event.\n\nLocation\n\nDunkery is composed of Middle Devonian sedimentary rock, () known as the Hangman Sandstone Formation.  This supports acidic soils. \nThe ridge along the top of the hill is  long.\n\nAt 1705 ft ordnance datum (OD), the mean height above sea level,  Dunkery Beacon is the highest natural point in Somerset,  although the tip of the Mendip TV Mast is higher at  OD. Dunkery is ranked 23rd in the UK in terms of dominance and is a Marilyn, meaning that it is a peak with 150 m or more of relative height. The nearest higher hill is Yes Tor, 37 mi away. John Fry, a character in R. D. Blackmore's 1869 novel Lorna Doone, calls it the \"haighest place of Hexmoor\". \n\nDunkery lies just 4 mi from the Bristol Channel at Porlock. The shortest route of ascent goes from the car park at Dunkery Gate, and is just  long. There are extensive views from the summit, from where the Bristol and English Channel coasts, the Brecon Beacons including Pen Y Fan, Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor, the Severn Bridges and Cleeve Hill 86 mi away in Gloucestershire are visible. \n\nHistory\n\nDunkery Hill was part of the \"Royal Forest of Exmoor\", established by Henry II according to the late 13th-century Hundred Rolls. There has been some debate about the origin of the name \"Dunkery\" and its predecessors \"Duncrey\" and \"Dunnecray\".  Eilert Ekwall suggests that it comes from the Welsh din meaning hillfort and creic or creag meaning rock.  \n\nThere are several Bronze Age burial mounds at or near the summit.  Two of the largest are Joaney How and Robin How, which have been damaged over many years, although plans have been made to restore and protect them.  \"How\" comes from the Norse for burial mound.  Joaney How on the northern slope, is more than 22 m in diameter.   On the southeastern slopes are four more cairns,  and there are a further two round cairns 390 m and 420 m southeast of Rex Stile Head.  In addition to the cairns are barrows, which also date from the Bronze Age. One bowl barrow on the southeastern spur of the Chains is  in diameter.  A circular funerary stone mound 850 m north of Dunkery Bridge, which is a  walk from the summit, dates from the Neolithic or Bronze Age. It is approximately  high and 14 m in diameter.  \n\nSweetworthy, on Dunkery Hill's north-facing slope, is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures;   one has a single rampart and external ditch, enclosing .  The rampart is still visible, and the ditch on the east side is used as a trackway.   There was a defended settlement above the main site.  It is also the site of a deserted medieval settlement, which has been designated an ancient monument.   It has been added to the Heritage at Risk register because of the vulnerability to plant growth. \n\nIn 1918 Sir Thomas Acland leased part of the land.along with a large part of the Holnicote Estate, for 500 years. Dunkery Hill was put up for sale in 1928. Labour Party activist and Member of Parliament Margaret Bondfield asked in the House of Commons if the government was willing to have it designated an ancient monument, to preserve it for future generations. She received the reply that although the government was agreeable to having the hill listed there were no funds available for its purchase;  the beacon and surrounding mounds were subsequently designated an ancient monument.  The beacon itself, and 960 acre of surrounding land, was donated in 1932 by Colonel W.W. Wiggin. A further 945 acre of nearby land was donated in 1934 by Mrs Hughes in memory of her husband Alan Hughes of Lynch Allerford, Minehead. The donations were commemorated in 1935 with an event when a plaque was attached to the summit memorial cairn. Further parts of the Holnicote Estate, which includes other land donated by the Acland family and others, was given in subsequent years.   \n\nEcology\n\nThe site is part of the North Exmoor Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), part of the Dunkery & Horner Woods National Nature Reserve  and part of the Exmoor Coastal Heaths Special Area of Conservation. \n\nThe hill is blanketed in heather, which gives it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, as well as some unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.\nQuestion:\nDunkery Beacon is the highest point in which English National Park?\nAnswer:\nExmoor National Park\nPassage:\nLicence to Kill (soundtrack)\nThe soundtrack to Licence to Kill, the 16th James Bond film of the same name, was released by MCA Records in 1989.\n\nBecause the usual James Bond composer John Barry (who had scored almost every film from From Russia with Love onwards) was not available at the time as he was undergoing throat surgery, the soundtrack's more upbeat and suspenseful score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen.\n\nInitially Eric Clapton and Vic Flick were asked to write and perform the theme song to Licence to Kill. The theme was said to have been a new version based on the James Bond Theme. The guitar riff heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Flick. \n\nThe prospect, however, fell apart and Gladys Knight's song and performance was chosen, later becoming a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. The song was composed by Narada Michael Walden, Jeffrey Cohen and Walter Afanasieff, based on the \"horn line\" from Goldfinger, which required royalty payments to the original writers.  At five-minutes twelve seconds it is the longest Bond theme. The music video of \"Licence to Kill\" was directed by Daniel Kleinman, who later took over the reins of title designer from Maurice Binder for the 1995 Bond film, GoldenEye.\n\nAll the instrumental tracks are amalgams of various sequences and musical cues from the film rather than straight score excerpts. The end credits of the film feature the song \"If You Asked Me To\" sung by Patti LaBelle. Though the song was a top ten R&B charter and a minor pop hit for LaBelle, in 1992, the song was covered by and became a much bigger hit for singer C\u00e9line Dion. The track \"Wedding Party\", used during the wedding of Felix Leiter to Della Churchill, makes reference to the track \"Jump Up\" from the first Bond film, Dr. No.\n\nTrack listing\n\n# \"Licence to Kill\" \u2013 Gladys Knight\n# \"Wedding Party\" \u2013 Ivory\n# \"Dirty Love\" \u2013 Tim Feehan\n# \"Pam\"\n# \"If You Asked Me To\" \u2013 Patti LaBelle\n# \"James & Felix on Their Way to Church\"contains the James Bond Theme, originally composed for the Dr. No soundtrack\n# \"His Funny Valentine\"\n# \"Sanchez Is in the Bahamas/Shark Fishing\"\n# \"Ninja\"\n# \"Licence Revoked\"\nQuestion:\nCan you name the singer of the title track for '1989 - Licence to Kill'?\nAnswer:\nGladys Knight\nPassage:\nHouses of Parliament | Monet Gallery\nHouses of Parliament | Monet Gallery\nMonet \u2022 Paintings \u2022 Houses of Parliament\nHouses of Parliament\nClaude Monet first went to London in 1870 to escape the Franco-Prussian War. While there he would have seen and been inspired by painters like Turner and began to develop his use of bright colors that would become a defining element of Impressionist painting.\nAfter traveling and moving to Giverny, where he would have his famous gardens, Monet returned to London in 1899 and began work on a series of paintings depicting the Palace of Westminster, also called The House of Parliament, or simply Parliament. His Houses of Parliament series contains 19 canvases all exactly the same size and depicting the same scene from the same vantage point.\nStarting in February 1900, Monet began painting a view of Parliament from across the river Thames. From a terrace on the second floor of the St. Thomas Hospital, Monet could see the Houses of Parliament, including Big Ben, sitting on the edge of the river. In each canvas Parliament is on the right, with water to the left and in front and sky above. As in previous works, these paintings are studies in showing the changing landscape. Because his subject, the light, changes so quickly Monet would sketch out the\nbuilding of Parliament before hand and then paint, adding the color and detail, while looking out his terrace over the river.\nIn previous Series paintings, Haystacks and Rouen Cathedral , Monet showed the effect light and the atmosphere has on objects. While the Parliament series has the building, Westminster Palace is so distorted and obscured by the fog and smog it becomes secondary as the subject. For the Parliament series, we are not just seeing the effect of light on objects we see, Monet is showing the effect of light on the atmosphere itself. Even today London is famous for its fog, and in the 1880\u2019s the Fog was at its peak being heavy and frequent. By 1900, the fog had been decreasing, but was still apparent and being thickened by the smog a result of London\u2019s growing industry.\nThroughout the series of paintings Monet shows the river change from blue and green to bright orange and red lit by the afternoon sun. Monet\u2019s brushstrokes create depth and layers within the fog showing the thickness and weight of the atmosphere. In one painting Parlement, coucher du soleil, 1902, the sun is setting behind the clouds creating highlights and shadows high within the sky turning the river into a mirror reflecting Westminster Palace. In another Houses of Parliament, stormy sky, 1904, almost the entire canvas is orange; as the storm, lit by the high sun, hangs over London darkening Parliament. A few of his canvases show the disc of the sun, visible through the fog and reflecting on the water, while others show a dark sky, the sun hidden behind a thick fog.\nMonet made two trips to London to work on the Houses of Parliament series, in 1900 and 1901. While he painted them from the St. Thomas Hospital, he returned to France with canvases and worked on them for the next three years not showing them until 1904. It may be thought by some viewers that their apparent lack of detail and the years spent working on them by memory may result in a different scene than what he saw, but modern researchers have been able to analyze his works showing his accuracy. By tracing known astrological patterns and solar geometry, not only have scholars been able to pinpoint the exact room and terrace he was painting from, they know the precise times.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nKevin Lloyd\nKevin Reardon Lloyd (28 March 1949 \u2013 2 May 1998) was an English actor, best known for portraying DC Alfred \"Tosh\" Lines in Thames Television's The Bill.\n\nBorn in Derby, Lloyd trained at East 15 Acting School in Loughton, Essex. Prior to appearing in The Bill he had already played the high-profile role of nightclub owner, Don Watkins, in the soap opera Coronation Street. He also made appearances in a number of other TV shows, including the first series of Starting Out, Boon, Minder, Dear John, Farrington of the F.O., Dempsey and Makepeace, Z-Cars, Andy Capp, Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Blake's 7 and Casualty. His film credits included roles in Trial by Combat (1976), Britannia Hospital (1982), Don't Open till Christmas (1984) and Link (1986).\n\nLloyd was one of the most popular members of the television show, The Bill. In 1996, the show won the award for \"Best TV Drama\" at the National Television Awards and it was Lloyd who collected it on behalf of the cast and crew. His Welsh-born father, Ellis Aled Lloyd, was himself a police officer who was killed in an accident while answering an emergency call aged 46 in 1970. \n\nA chronic alcoholic, he played \"Tosh\" continuously from 1988 until he was sacked from The Bill in 1998 for his lack of punctuality and failing to learn his lines. Within days, he was admitted to a clinic in Burton upon Trent for detoxification and was administered Antabuse (Disulfiram), but then left the premises to drink alcohol. He returned to the clinic in an intoxicated state, retired to bed, fell asleep, then choked on his vomit. Lloyd died just one week after recording his last scenes for The Bill, and the character of Tosh was still appearing on screen for more than a month after Lloyd's death.\n\nHe had been so popular on The Bill that on 26 February 1992, within four years of joining the show, he was selected as special guest for the TV guest show This Is Your Life. \n\nHe was the brother of ITN reporter Terry Lloyd who was killed in the Iraq War in 2003.   His son, James Lloyd, is an actor who also appeared on The Bill between 2004 and 2006.\nQuestion:\nWhat part did the late Kevin Lloyd play in \u2018The Bill\u2019?\nAnswer:\nAlfred \u2018TOSH\u2019 LINES\nPassage:\nThe Bartender and the Thief\n\"The Bartender and the Thief\" is a 1998 single by Welsh rock band Stereophonics. It was the first single taken from their second album Performance and Cocktails. It was released on 9 November 1998 and reached #3 in the UK charts.\n\nThe song is the second track on the Performance and Cocktails album. A live version from Cardiff Castle is available on CD2 of the single. Another live version from Sheffield Arena is on the \"Moviestar\" single. A bar version of the song is on CD 1 of the \"I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio\" single.\n\nThe music video features the band playing at Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand and is based on the Francis Ford Coppola movie, Apocalypse Now.\n\nThe song, which is one of their heavier tracks, is frequently played amongst their live sets. During live performances, vocalist Kelly Jones has been known to utilise the two bars without vocals before the final chorus to reference the Mot\u00f6rhead song \"Ace of Spades\". The lyrics therefore are \"The ace of spades, the ace of spades. The bartender and the thief were lovers...\"\n\nStrangely, the song's full length intro only featured on the CD1 single (and in the music video), but was edited off the Performance & Cocktails album.\n\nWelsh PDC Darts player Mark Webster uses this track as his entrance music.

In A Collection of English Words not generally used, with their Significations and Original, in two Alphabetical Catalogues, the one of such as are proper to the Northern, the other to the Southern Counties (1691), John Ray (1627-1705) recorded, in North Country Words:\nA Hog; a Sheep of a year old; used also in Northampton and Leicester shires, where they also call it a Hoggrel.\nAnd, in South and East Country Words, he wrote:\nHogs; Young Sheep, Northamptonshire. Used also in the same sense in Yorkshire.\nJohn Ray, however, understood hog as meaning domestic pig in A Collection of English Proverbs (1678):\nNe\u2019re lose a hog for an half-penny-worth of tarr.\nA man may spare in an ill time: as some who will rather die, then [= than] spend ten groats in Physick. Some have it, lose not a sheep, &c. Indeed tarr is more used about sheep then swine.\nThe current form of the proverb is first recorded in English Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases (1869), by William Carew Hazlitt (1834-1913):\nTo spoil the ship for a half-pennyworth of tar.\nHowever, the author adds:\nBut, in Cornwall, I heard a different version, which appeared to me to be more consistent with probability: \u201cDon\u2019t spoil the sheep for a ha\u2019porth of tar;\u201d and this agrees with a third variation: \u201cDon\u2019t spoil the hog for, &c.,\u201d a hog in some counties (Lincolnshire, for instance,) standing for a sheep of a year old. But, as Mr. Dyce (A General Glossary to Shakespeare\u2019s Works, article ship*) observes, the two words, sheep and ship, seem formerly to have been pronounced very much alike.\n(* In fact, this observation appears under sheep: \u201csheep formerly often pronounced (as it still is in certain counties) ship, and even so written: hence the quibbles\u201d)\nIn A Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (1993), B. A. Phythian explains that, because of this similarity in pronunciation,\nnon-countryfolk obviously assumed that the expression referred to a ship, the assumption being reinforced by the reference to tar, which was widely used on wooden ships to coat and preserve the timbers. To complete this transformation of a rustic expression into a nautical-sounding one, the rather extravagant and unconvincing idea of \u2018losing\u2019 an entire ship for the sake of a small economy was changed to \u2018spoiling\u2019.\nQuestion:\n\"What usually completes the phrase \"\"to spoil the ship for a ha'porth of ...\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nTar-based shampoo\nPassage:\nDashiki\nThe dashiki is a colorful garment for men widely worn in West Africa and also worn in other parts of Africa. It covers the top half of the body. It has formal and informal versions and varies from simple draped clothing to fully tailored suits. A common form is a loose-fitting pullover garment, with an ornate V-shaped collar, and tailored and embroidered neck and sleeve lines.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name dashiki is derived from the Hausa word ', which means shirt. It is usually worn with a brimless Kufi cap which is worn in Islamic communities in Africa and the African diaspora, and a pair of pants. In Ghana, the fabric is commonly known by people as \"Angelina\".\n\nHistory in the West \n\nThe dashiki was made popular in the western parts of the world by Oba (Yoruba word for king) Ofuntola Oseijeman Adelabu Adefunmi, who was born Walter Eugene in Detroit, Michigan, USA in 1928. He became interested in African Studies at the age of 16, and traveled to Haiti at the age of 20 in order to be exposed to African religion from indigenous Africans. Soon after, he returned to the U.S. and began a small scale manufacturing business which included African attire, most notably dashikis.\n\nVersions \n\nThe informal version is a traditional print or embroidered dashiki. Three formal versions exist. The first type consists of a dashiki, sokoto (drawstring trousers), and a matching kufi. This style is called a dashiki suit or dashiki trouser set and it is the attire worn by most grooms during wedding ceremonies. The second version consists of an ankle-length shirt, matching kufi, and sokoto and is called a Senegalese kaftan. The third type consists of a dashiki and matching trousers. A flowing gown is worn over these. This type is called a grand boubou or an agbada.\n\nThere are several different styles of dashiki suits available from clothing stores. The type of shirt included in the set determines the name. The traditional dashiki suit includes a thigh-length shirt. The short sleeve, traditional style is preferred by purists. A long dashiki suit includes a shirt that is knee-length or longer. However, if the shirt reaches the ankles, it is a Senegalese kaftan. Finally, the lace dashiki suit includes a shirt made of lace. A hybrid of the dashiki and caftan worn by females is a traditional male dashiki with a western skirt.\n\nWedding colors \n\nWhite is the traditional color for West African weddings.   Most grooms wear white dashiki suits during wedding ceremonies.  Some couples wear non-traditional colours. The most common non-traditional colors are purple and blue.\n* Purple and lavender: the color of African royalty. \n* Blue: blue is the color of love, peace, and harmony.\n\nFuneral colors\n\nBlack and red are the traditional colors of mourning. \n\nDashiki in the United States \n\nThe dashiki found a market in America during the black cultural and political struggles in the 1960s. The dashiki was featured in the movies Uptight (1968), Putney Swope (1969), and the weekly television series Soul Train (1971). Jim Brown, Wilt Chamberlain, Sammy Davis Jr., and Bill Russell were among the well-known African-American athletes and entertainers who wore the dashiki on talk shows. Hippies also adopted dashikis into their wardrobe as a means to express counterculture values.  Former District of Columbia mayor and council member Marion Barry was known for wearing a dashiki leading up to elections.\n\nThe term dashiki began appearing in print at least as early as 1967. Reporting on the 1967 Newark riots in the Amsterdam News on July 22, 1967, George Barner refers to a new African garment called a \"danshiki\". An article by Faith Berry in the New York Times Magazine includes it on July 7, 1968.\n\n\"Dashiki\" formally appeared in the Webster's New World Dictionary, 1st College Edition 1970/72.  It cites J. Benning as having coined the word in 1967.  J. Benning, M. Clarke, H. Davis and W. Smith were founders of New Breed, the first manufacturer of the garment in the United States, Harlem, New York. York Wong joined the company as Financial Vice President in 1971.\n\nDashiki has been found on many musicians mostly the African-American musicians including famous ones like Chris Brown ,  Beyonce, Rihanna, Zendaya, ScHoolboy Q,Jhene Aiko,  Q-Tip and many more\nQuestion:\nWhat item of clothing is a 'Dashiki'?\nAnswer:\nString vest\n\n\nPassage:\nWellington College, Berkshire\nHome - Wellington College\nIn\nThe Master's Welcome\n\"Hard to imagine it done better.

A long dashiki suit includes a shirt that is knee-length or longer. However, if the shirt reaches the ankles, it is a Senegalese kaftan. Finally, the lace dashiki suit includes a shirt made of lace. A hybrid of the dashiki and caftan worn by females is a traditional male dashiki with a western skirt.\n\nWedding colors \n\nWhite is the traditional color for West African weddings.   Most grooms wear white dashiki suits during wedding ceremonies.  Some couples wear non-traditional colours. The most common non-traditional colors are purple and blue.\n* Purple and lavender: the color of African royalty. \n* Blue: blue is the color of love, peace, and harmony.\n\nFuneral colors\n\nBlack and red are the traditional colors of mourning. \n\nDashiki in the United States \n\nThe dashiki found a market in America during the black cultural and political struggles in the 1960s. The dashiki was featured in the movies Uptight (1968), Putney Swope (1969), and the weekly television series Soul Train (1971). Jim Brown, Wilt Chamberlain, Sammy Davis Jr., and Bill Russell were among the well-known African-American athletes and entertainers who wore the dashiki on talk shows. Hippies also adopted dashikis into their wardrobe as a means to express counterculture values.  Former District of Columbia mayor and council member Marion Barry was known for wearing a dashiki leading up to elections.\n\nThe term dashiki began appearing in print at least as early as 1967. Reporting on the 1967 Newark riots in the Amsterdam News on July 22, 1967, George Barner refers to a new African garment called a \"danshiki\". An article by Faith Berry in the New York Times Magazine includes it on July 7, 1968.\n\n\"Dashiki\" formally appeared in the Webster's New World Dictionary, 1st College Edition 1970/72.  It cites J. Benning as having coined the word in 1967.  J. Benning, M. Clarke, H. Davis and W. Smith were founders of New Breed, the first manufacturer of the garment in the United States, Harlem, New York. York Wong joined the company as Financial Vice President in 1971.\n\nDashiki has been found on many musicians mostly the African-American musicians including famous ones like Chris Brown ,  Beyonce, Rihanna, Zendaya, ScHoolboy Q,Jhene Aiko,  Q-Tip and many more\nQuestion:\nWhat item of clothing is a 'Dashiki'?\nAnswer:\nString vest\n", "answers": ["Berkshire, England", "Highway, Berkshire", "Royal Country of Berkshire", "Berkshire", "Royal Berkshire", "County of Berkshire", "Royal County of Berkshire", "County of Berks"], "pred": "In which county is Wellington College?

Competing martial artists generally practice their skills and train for hundreds of hours longer than their matches ever last, and the number of different training modalities necessary to be successful can be overwhelming. Conditioning the martial arts athlete might not be as easy as it seems at first and there are many schools of thought.\n\u00a0\nThe martial arts athlete should be very wise when implementing any strength and conditioning training that does not directly involve enhancing specific combat skills. As a strength and conditioning coach for several MMA fighters, I have always lived by the philosophy that the training I do with these athletes should only enhance all of their other training. Most competitive combat sport athletes train at least twice a day and I have found that too many strength coaches overwork these athletes, as if it was another 10-round sparring session. Or, even worse, coaches implement ineffective conditioning programs that do not benefit the athlete or add to their overall training. I am not here to break down my athletes, or even more importantly, waste their time. I have to give them exactly what they need to complement their skills to be successful in competition.\n\u00a0\nConditioning for the combat athlete is not exactly simple. These athletes need to have a balance between quick, explosive, and repetitive strength production, as well as have the endurance capacity to maintain these qualities over a match lasting anywhere from 5 to 25 minutes. Some coaches like implementing long runs. Though these runs might be effective for a completely unconditioned athlete who needs to create a foundation, if used too much you will have a weak and non-explosive athlete. On the other hand, if you solely concentrate on explosive work, such as Olympic lifting, you have an explosive athlete with little stamina, who better connect with the first couple of punches or else he/she is going to gas out and become a human punching bag for the opponent.\n\u00a0\nSo, it sounds like an impossible task to train for both explosive strength and endurance and to do it without running your athlete to the ground. It can be accomplished, though, and one of the best tools I have found for the job is using the kettlebell for training circuits. By manipulating different weights, using dynamics exercises, and varying time intervals, kettlebells allow the combat athlete to be strong, explosive, and have a high level of endurance to maintain those qualities over the course of their match.\n\u00a0\nIn this article I am going to show you how I use kettlebell circuits with my athletes. You do not need to train or even be a combat athlete to enjoy the benefits of these circuits. All you need is a kettlebell or two and the desire to get better.\n\u00a0\nWhen I create and customize kettlebell circuits for combat athletes there are a few concepts I consider when incorporating them into the athlete\u2019s overall program:\n\u00a0\nKettlebell exercises should be multi-joint movements that enhance athletic movements, like squats, lunges, and swings.\nCircuit times should be around a 2:1 work to rest ratio. I prefer 20-60 seconds of work and 10-30 seconds of rest. I also like to make the total circuit times replicate the rounds for their competition. For example, if a round in competition is 3 minutes then the circuit total time should be around 3 minutes of work as well.\nEach exercise should be safe to perform at a continuous and fast rate.\nThe exercise selection should be balanced and organized properly. You want to incorporate double joint movements (squats, deadlifts, 2-arm swings) with unilateral (single-sided) movements as well (lunges, Romanian deadlifts, and 1-arm swings).\n\u00a0\nBelow are some examples of strength and conditioning circuits I use to get my athletes in shape and performing at their best.\nQuestion:\nLasting anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes, what are the intervals that make up a boxing match called?\nAnswer:\nRounded\nPassage:\nChild Is Father of the Man\n\"Child Is Father of the Man\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks. Originally recorded by the American rock band the Beach Boys, it was to be included on their projected album Smile. Due to the project's abandonment, the intended nature of the piece is mostly unknown. The result left is a nearly instrumental piece with the words \"child\" and \"father of the man\" sung over the chorus. Biographer Jon Stebbins describes the track: \"a brooding and expansive aura, with a plaintive harmonica line not dissimilar to those heard on Ennio Morricone spaghetti western soundtracks.\" \n\nIn 2004, Wilson completed the track for his album Brian Wilson Presents Smile. This rerecorded version incorporated an additional set of lyrics penned by Parks. In 2011, the Beach Boys' version was released for the first time as part of The Smile Sessions box set.\n\nComposition\n\n\"Child is father of the man\" is an idiom originating from the poem \"My Heart Leaps Up\" by William Wordsworth. In a 1966 interview, Wilson mistakenly attributed it to Karl Menninger, and added that the saying had fascinated him.  There exist many different interpretations of the phrase, the most popular of which is man being the product of habits and behavior developed in youth. According to collaborator Van Dyke Parks, he brought up the idiom to Wilson.\n\nRecording\n\nSeveral sections of the song were recorded, but aside from a group piano demo, only one variation of the chorus's backing track was overdubbed with vocals sung in elaborate musical rounds. The structure was never finalized. According to The Smile Sessions compiler Mark Linett, \"When he's not singing, you can hear faint background vocal parts that no longer exist on the multitrack. They must have been in his headphones, and were picked up by the vocal mic. It could be that Brian decided he didn't need them, or that he was going to re-record them, but never did. You hear this sort of stuff throughout the tapes.\"  The song was worked on between October and December 1966. After one more revisit in April 1967, the track was abandoned forever by the group.\n\nDecades later in both The Smile Sessions and Brian Wilson Presents Smile, the song was included as the third track of the second movement. \"Child Is Father of the Man\" precedes \"Surf's Up\" and follows \"Look (Song for Children)\". On The Smile Sessions, some vocals from \"Surf's Up\" were digitally inserted into the instrumental track. When rerecorded by Wilson in 2004, he sang newly written lyrics by Parks (Easy, my child / It's just enough to believe / Out of the wild / into what you can conceive / You'll achieve).   \n\nLegacy\n\nThe song's chorus was later rewritten and rerecorded as the chorus for \"Little Bird\", a song on the band's 1968 Friends album released as a single.  It was then quoted within the closing section of \"Surf's Up\", which ended up appearing on their 1971 album of the same name.\nPersonnel\n\n;The Beach Boys\n* Carl Wilson \u2013 vocals (The Smile Sessions)\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the line 'The Child is Father of the Man'?\nAnswer:\nWORDSWORTH\nPassage:\nPeter Andre\nPeter Andre (born Peter James Andrea; 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London) is an English-Australian singer, songwriter, businessman, presenter and television personality of Greek Cypriot descent.\n\nHe gained popularity as a singer, best known for his successful singles \"Mysterious Girl\" and \"Flava\". He is also known for appearing on the third series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, and the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing, in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara.\n\nDuring his time on I'm A Celebrity, Andre developed an on-screen romantic relationship with fellow contestant, Katie Price.

During this time, Andre attended Benowa State High School on the Gold Coast. He was raised as a Jehovah's Witness, but is now lapsed.  \n\nTelevision\n\nDuring their marriage, Andre and Katie Price launched the Katie & Peter franchise on ITV2 which documented their life together.

They have two children together: son Junior Savva, born on 13 June 2005, and daughter Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther, born on 29 June 2007.  While married to Price, Andre was stepfather to her son Harvey, a blind and autistic child from Price's earlier relationship with football player Dwight Yorke. \n\nIn May 2009, it was announced that Andr\u00e9 and Price had separated after 3\u00bd years of marriage.  They were officially divorced on 8 September 2009. \n\nSince July 2012, Andre has been in a relationship with medical student Emily MacDonagh, who is 16 years his junior.

These athletes need to have a balance between quick, explosive, and repetitive strength production, as well as have the endurance capacity to maintain these qualities over a match lasting anywhere from 5 to 25 minutes. Some coaches like implementing long runs. Though these runs might be effective for a completely unconditioned athlete who needs to create a foundation, if used too much you will have a weak and non-explosive athlete. On the other hand, if you solely concentrate on explosive work, such as Olympic lifting, you have an explosive athlete with little stamina, who better connect with the first couple of punches or else he/she is going to gas out and become a human punching bag for the opponent.\n\u00a0\nSo, it sounds like an impossible task to train for both explosive strength and endurance and to do it without running your athlete to the ground. It can be accomplished, though, and one of the best tools I have found for the job is using the kettlebell for training circuits. By manipulating different weights, using dynamics exercises, and varying time intervals, kettlebells allow the combat athlete to be strong, explosive, and have a high level of endurance to maintain those qualities over the course of their match.\n\u00a0\nIn this article I am going to show you how I use kettlebell circuits with my athletes. You do not need to train or even be a combat athlete to enjoy the benefits of these circuits. All you need is a kettlebell or two and the desire to get better.\n\u00a0\nWhen I create and customize kettlebell circuits for combat athletes there are a few concepts I consider when incorporating them into the athlete\u2019s overall program:\n\u00a0\nKettlebell exercises should be multi-joint movements that enhance athletic movements, like squats, lunges, and swings.\nCircuit times should be around a 2:1 work to rest ratio. I prefer 20-60 seconds of work and 10-30 seconds of rest. I also like to make the total circuit times replicate the rounds for their competition. For example, if a round in competition is 3 minutes then the circuit total time should be around 3 minutes of work as well.\nEach exercise should be safe to perform at a continuous and fast rate.\nThe exercise selection should be balanced and organized properly. You want to incorporate double joint movements (squats, deadlifts, 2-arm swings) with unilateral (single-sided) movements as well (lunges, Romanian deadlifts, and 1-arm swings).\n\u00a0\nBelow are some examples of strength and conditioning circuits I use to get my athletes in shape and performing at their best.\nQuestion:\nLasting anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes, what are the intervals that make up a boxing match called?\nAnswer:\nRounded\nPassage:\nChild Is Father of the Man\n\"Child Is Father of the Man\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks. Originally recorded by the American rock band the Beach Boys, it was to be included on their projected album Smile. Due to the project's abandonment, the intended nature of the piece is mostly unknown. The result left is a nearly instrumental piece with the words \"child\" and \"father of the man\" sung over the chorus. Biographer Jon Stebbins describes the track: \"a brooding and expansive aura, with a plaintive harmonica line not dissimilar to those heard on Ennio Morricone spaghetti western soundtracks.\" \n\nIn 2004, Wilson completed the track for his album Brian Wilson Presents Smile. This rerecorded version incorporated an additional set of lyrics penned by Parks. In 2011, the Beach Boys' version was released for the first time as part of The Smile Sessions box set.\n\nComposition\n\n\"Child is father of the man\" is an idiom originating from the poem \"My Heart Leaps Up\" by William Wordsworth. In a 1966 interview, Wilson mistakenly attributed it to Karl Menninger, and added that the saying had fascinated him.  There exist many different interpretations of the phrase, the most popular of which is man being the product of habits and behavior developed in youth. According to collaborator Van Dyke Parks, he brought up the idiom to Wilson.\n\nRecording\n\nSeveral sections of the song were recorded, but aside from a group piano demo, only one variation of the chorus's backing track was overdubbed with vocals sung in elaborate musical rounds. The structure was never finalized. According to The Smile Sessions compiler Mark Linett, \"When he's not singing, you can hear faint background vocal parts that no longer exist on the multitrack. They must have been in his headphones, and were picked up by the vocal mic. It could be that Brian decided he didn't need them, or that he was going to re-record them, but never did. You hear this sort of stuff throughout the tapes.\"  The song was worked on between October and December 1966. After one more revisit in April 1967, the track was abandoned forever by the group.\n\nDecades later in both The Smile Sessions and Brian Wilson Presents Smile, the song was included as the third track of the second movement. \"Child Is Father of the Man\" precedes \"Surf's Up\" and follows \"Look (Song for Children)\". On The Smile Sessions, some vocals from \"Surf's Up\" were digitally inserted into the instrumental track. When rerecorded by Wilson in 2004, he sang newly written lyrics by Parks (Easy, my child / It's just enough to believe / Out of the wild / into what you can conceive / You'll achieve).   \n\nLegacy\n\nThe song's chorus was later rewritten and rerecorded as the chorus for \"Little Bird\", a song on the band's 1968 Friends album released as a single.  It was then quoted within the closing section of \"Surf's Up\", which ended up appearing on their 1971 album of the same name.\nPersonnel\n\n;The Beach Boys\n* Carl Wilson \u2013 vocals (The Smile Sessions)\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the line 'The Child is Father of the Man'?\nAnswer:\nWORDSWORTH\nPassage:\nPeter Andre\nPeter Andre (born Peter James Andrea; 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London) is an English-Australian singer, songwriter, businessman, presenter and television personality of Greek Cypriot descent.\n\nHe gained popularity as a singer, best known for his successful singles \"Mysterious Girl\" and \"Flava\". He is also known for appearing on the third series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, and the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing, in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara.\n\nDuring his time on I'm A Celebrity, Andre developed an on-screen romantic relationship with fellow contestant, Katie Price. Andre and Price got married two years after the show's finale; they had two children, and released the 2006 album A Whole New World together, before divorcing in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Andre released the album Revelation with the single \"Behind Closed Doors\", which reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. He followed it up with his sixth studio album Accelerate in 2010.\n\nEarly life\n\nPeter Andre was born on 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London. The family lived on the Gold Coast in Queensland during Andre's teenage years. In 1989, 16-year-old Andre became a contestant on the show New Faces, on which he was offered a recording contract for $146,000. During this time, Andre attended Benowa State High School on the Gold Coast. He was raised as a Jehovah's Witness, but is now lapsed.  \n\nTelevision\n\nDuring their marriage, Andre and Katie Price launched the Katie & Peter franchise on ITV2 which documented their life together. The franchise included several fly-on-the-wall reality series which comprised When Jordan Met Peter, Jordan & Peter: Laid Bare and Jordan & Peter: Marriage and Mayhem (2004\u201305); Katie & Peter: The Next Chapter, Katie & Peter: The Baby Diaries and Katie & Peter: Unleashed (2007); Katie & Peter: Down Under; and Katie & Peter: African Adventures (2008); and Katie & Peter: Stateside in 2009. Their 2009 separation resulted in their individual shows being recorded: Peter Andre: The Next Chapter continued on ITV2 until 2011, followed by Peter Andre: Here 2 Help (2011) and Peter Andre: My Life (2011\u201313).\n\nIn July 2010, Andre and Jason Manford were team captains on the ITV series Odd One In.\n\nIn 2013, Andre was a guest judge on the ITV entertainment series Your Face Sounds Familiar.\n\nIn 2013, he guest-presented five episodes of Sunday Scoop on ITV. Since 11 November 2013, Andre has presented 60 Minute Makeover, which has been re-branded as Peter Andre's 60 Minute Makeover.\n\nIn 2014, Andre released the song \"Kid\" for the film Mr. Peabody & Sherman which is the lead single from his album Big Night. \n\nOn 8 October 2014, Andre co-hosted the ITVBe opener with Jamelia.  In 2014, Andre became the new face to feature in supermarket Iceland's television commercials.\n\nAndre is currently starring in the ITV weekly show Give a Pet a Home which works alongside the RSPCA in Birmingham. \nIn August 2015, he was announced as a contestant for the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing which began in September 2015 in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara. They went out just before the quarter final; on week 10, and therefore finished seventh place.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAndre began dating glamour model Katie Price after they met on reality show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in early 2004. The couple got engaged secretly in May of the same year but it wasn't announced publicly until months later. Andre married Price on 10 September 2005 in Highclere Castle, Hampshire. They have two children together: son Junior Savva, born on 13 June 2005, and daughter Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther, born on 29 June 2007.  While married to Price, Andre was stepfather to her son Harvey, a blind and autistic child from Price's earlier relationship with football player Dwight Yorke. \n\nIn May 2009, it was announced that Andr\u00e9 and Price had separated after 3\u00bd years of marriage.  They were officially divorced on 8 September 2009. \n\nSince July 2012, Andre has been in a relationship with medical student Emily MacDonagh, who is 16 years his junior.  MacDonagh gave birth to Andre's third child, a girl named Amelia, on 7 January 2014.  Andre and MacDonagh married on 11 July 2015 in Exeter at Mamhead House.\nOn 26 May 2016, Andre announced that his wife MacDonagh is pregnant with the second child for the couple.   \n\nDiscography\n\n* Peter Andre (1993)\n* Natural (1996)\n* Time (1997)\n* The Long Road Back (2004)\n* A Whole New World (with Katie Price) (2006)\n* Revelation (2009)\n* Unconditional: Love Songs (2010)\n* Accelerate (2010)\n* Angels & Demons (2012)\n* Big Night (2014)\n* Come Fly with Me (2015)\n* White Christmas (2015)\n\nFilmography\n\nTelevision\n\n*I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nClun Forest\nClun Forest is a remote, rural area of open pastures, moorland and mixed deciduous/coniferous woodland in the southwest part of the English county of Shropshire and also just over the border into Powys, Wales.\n\nIt was once a large forest covering an area that stretched from Ludlow up the Clun Valley. It now is only forested in some wooded areas, such as Radnor Wood, though a fairly large area of forest exists on the Wales\u2013England border north of Anchor (the planted Ceri Forest).\n\nThe ancient Offa's Dyke runs north-south through the area (and can be walked by the Offa's Dyke Path).\n\nIt is a deanery of the Church of England's Diocese of Hereford. \n\nA Shropshire Lad \n\nA. E. Housman wrote as part of his series of poems A Shropshire Lad:\n\n    \"In valleys of springs of rivers      \n       By Ony and Teme and Clun,          \n    The country for easy livers,          \n       The quietest under the sun...\n\n    'Tis a long way further than Knighton,\n       A quieter place than Clun,         \n    Where doomsday may thunder and lighten\n       And little 'twill matter to one.\"\nQuestion:\nClun Forest lies in which English county?\nAnswer:\nSalopia\nPassage:\nTongue and groove\nA strong joint, the tongue and groove joint is widely used for re-entrant angles. The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded.  In expensive cabinet work, glued dovetail and multiple tongue and groove are used.\n\nTongue and groove is a method of fitting similar objects together, edge to edge, used mainly with wood, in flooring, parquetry, panelling, and similar constructions. Tongue and groove joints allow two flat pieces to be joined strongly together to make a single flat surface. Before plywood became common, tongue and groove boards were also used for sheathing buildings and to construct concrete formwork.\n\nEach piece has a slot (the groove) cut all along one edge, and a thin, deep ridge (the tongue) on the opposite edge. The tongue projects a little less than the depth of the groove. Two or more pieces thus fit together closely. The joint is not normally glued, as shrinkage would then pull the tongue off.\n\nIn another assembly method, the pieces are end-matched. This method eliminates the need for mitre joints, face nailing, and the use of joints on 16 inch or 24 inch centres of conventional framing.\n\nFor many uses, tongue and groove boards have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of plywood and later composite wood boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality.  Plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for sub-floors used in platform framing is often supplied with tongue and groove edges.\n\nWhen joining thicker materials, several tongue and groove joints may be used one above the other.\n\nMethods\n\nOne of the following woodworking tools may be used to produce the tongue and groove:\n* A four- or six-head moulder (for large quantities)\n* A wood shaper (spindle moulder)\n* A circular saw bench\n* Suitable hand planes: a plough plane for the groove and a tongue plane for the tongue, or a combination plane\n* A spindle router\n\nTongue-in-groove\n\nTongue-in-groove is similar to tongue and groove, but instead of the tongue forming part of one of the edges, it is a separate, loose piece that fits between two identically grooved edges. The tongue may or may not be of the same material as the grooved pieces joined by the tongue. For example, plywood flooring is commonly grooved at the edges, and plastic tongues are used to form the joint.\nQuestion:\nA tongue and groove joint is used when working with what material?\nAnswer:\nDiffuse-porous wood\nPassage:\nSenegal\nSenegal (;   ), officially the Republic of Senegal (), is a country located in West Africa. Senegal is bordered by the North African country of Mauritania in the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast, and Guinea-Bissau to the southwest. Senegal further borders the country of The Gambia, a sovereign enclave occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the Gambia river, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with the country of Cape Verde. Senegal's economical and political capital is Dakar. It is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia,  and owes its name to the Senegal River, which borders it to the east and north. The name \"Senegal\" comes from the Wolof \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"Our Boat.\" Senegal covers a land area of almost 197000 km2}} and has an estimated population of about 13 million. The climate is Sahelian, but there is a rainy season.\n\nCultures and influences \n\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since the Prehistory. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the Jolof Empire. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, phosphate mining, fertilizer production, petroleum refining, construction materials, ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including peanuts, sugarcane, cotton, green beans, tomatoes, melons, and mangoes.Ndiaye, Mbalo.

Like the advertising posters which came before them, posters from the First World War were designed to motivate the viewer to enlist in the army, or to buy a war bond.\u00a0 They also had a secondary imperative: to inspire the viewer.\u00a0 In fact, in the United States, posters were part of a campaign of salesmanship to get the American public behind the war.\u00a0 American Posters used figures like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and Lady Liberty allegorically.\u00a0 French Bond Posters used Marianne.\nSilver coin featuring Marianne\nMarianne is the personification of the Republique Francaise and a symbol of liberty and freedom.\u00a0 Images of Marianne first appear in 1775 and depict her standing, young and determined, sometimes bare breasted as she leads soldiers into battle.\u00a0 Her image is allegorical, and is inspired by another allegorical figure, that of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and war.\nThe figure was used on the French postage stamp in 1849, and also on the franc.\u00a0 Today she appears on the French Euro coin.\u00a0 We encounter Marianne occasionally in the advertising poster.\nAdvertising poster for Saponite Laundry Soap, featuring Marianne berating a seated Napoleon\nShe is, however, best enjoyed in the poster in French World War One Bond and Reconstruction posters.\nM.

The intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian (zero degrees latitude and longitude) is in the gulf.\n\nAmong the many rivers that drain into the Gulf of Guinea are the Niger and the Volta. The coastline on the gulf includes the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny.\n\nThe Niger River in particular deposited organic sediments out to sea over millions of years which became crude oil. The Gulf of Guinea region, along with the Congo River delta and Angola further south, are expected to provide around a quarter of the United States' oil imports by 2015. This region is now regarded as one of the world's top oil and gas exploration hotspots.\n\nName\n\nThe origin of the name Guinea is thought to be an area in the region, although the specifics are disputed. Bovill (1995) gives a thorough description: \n\nThe name Guinea is usually said to have been a corrupt form of the name Ghana, picked up by the Portuguese in the Maghrib. The present writer finds this unacceptable. The name Guinea has been in use both in the Maghrib and in Europe long before Prince Henry's time. For example, on a map dated about 1320 by the Genoese cartographer Giovanni di Carignano, who got his information about Africa from a fellow-countryman in Sijilmas [ancient trading city in North Africa], we find Gunuia, and in the Catalan atlas of 1375 as Ginyia. A passage in Leo [Africanus] (vol. III, 822) points to Guinea having been a corrupt form of Jenne [2,000-year-old city in central Mali on Niger river], less famous than Ghana but nevertheless for many centuries famed in the Maghrib as a great market and a seat of learning. The relevant passage reads: \"The Kingdom of Ghinea . . . called by the merchants of our nation Gheneoa, by the natural inhabitants thereof Genni and by the Portugals and other people of Europe Ghinea.\" But it seems more probable that Guinea derives from aguinaou, the Berber for Negro. Marrakech [city in southeastern Morocco] has a gate, built in the twelfth century, called the Bab Aguinaou, the Gate of the Negro (Delafosse, Haut-S\u00e9n\u00e9gal-Niger, II, 277-278). The modern application of the name Guinea to the coast dates only from 1481. In that year the Portuguese built a fort, S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina (modern day Elmina), on the Gold Coast region, and their king, John II, was permitted by the Pope [Sixtus II or Innocent VIII] to style himself Lord of Guinea, a title that survived until the recent extinction of the monarchy.\n\nThe name \"Guinea\" was also applied to south coast of West Africa, north of the Gulf of Guinea, which became known as \"Upper Guinea\", and the west coast of Southern Africa, to the east, which became known as \"Lower Guinea.\" The name \"Guinea\" is still attached to the names of three countries in Africa: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea, as well as New Guinea in Melanesia.\n\nGeography\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southwest extent of the Gulf of Guinea as \"A line running Southeastward from Cape Three Points in Western region Ghana () to Cape Lopez in Gabon ()\". \n\nIslands in the Gulf of Guinea\n\nThe Gulf of Guinea contains a number of islands, the largest of which are in a southwest-northeast chain, forming part of the Cameroon line of volcanoes.\n\nAnnob\u00f3n\n\nAnnob\u00f3n, also known as Pagalu or Pigalu, is an island that is part of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nBobowasi Island\n\nBobowasi Island is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Western region Ghana.\n\nBioko\n\nBioko is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nCorisco\n\nCorisco is an island belonging to Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThe Elobeys\n\nElobey Grande and Elobey Chico are two small islands belonging to Equatorial Guinea.\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (officially the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe) is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea that became independent from Portugal in 1975. It is located off the western equatorial coast of Africa and consists of two islands, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. They are located about 140 km apart and about 250 and, respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon. Both islands are part of an extinct volcanic mountain range. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, the sizeable southern island, is situated just north of the Equator.\nQuestion:\nWhich major river empties into the Gulf of Guinea?\nAnswer:\nNiger Republic\nPassage:\nMar Chiquita Lake (C\u00f3rdoba)\nMar Chiquita (in Spanish literally \"Little Sea\") or Mar de Ansenuza is an endorheic salt lake located in the northeast of the province of C\u00f3rdoba, in central Argentina. The northeast corner of the lake also extends into southeastern Santiago del Estero Province. It is the largest of the naturally occurring saline lakes in Argentina. The lake is located in parts of five departments in the two provinces.\n\nThe lake occupies the southern part of a depression that measures about 50 miles/80\u00a0km (north\u2013south) by 28 miles/45\u00a0km (east\u2013west). Its surface area varies considerably, given its shallow depth (about 10 m), and ranges between 2000 and 6000\u00a0km\u00b2 (1242 and 3728\u00a0mi\u00b2).\n\nMar Chiquita is fed primarily by the saline waters of the Dulce River, coming from Santiago del Estero in the north after being joined by the Saladillo River. The lands around the lower course of the Dulce and Mar Chiquita are wetlands, populated by a large biodiversity (especially aquatic birds). From the southwest the lake receives the flow of the Primero/Suqu\u00eda and the Segundo/Xanaes rivers, as well as several streams; these inflows vary greatly from dry to rainy seasons. The salinity of Mar Chiquita is quite variable, with measured extremes ranging from 250 g/l in times of low water levels to around 40 g/l in very humid years, such as in the decade following 1977, when record rainfall flooded much of Miramar, C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nThere are several islands in the lake, the most important one being the M\u00e9dano Island. Mar Chiquita is slowly diminishing in volume due to increased evaporation and elevation of its bottom, and is ultimately bound to turn into a salt flat. The lake was formerly home to a growing tourism industry, and was the site of the Gran Hotel Vienna, a luxurious, lakefront establishment which functioned from 1945 to 1980, and has been the center of numerous mysteries and controversies.\nQuestion:\nMar Chiquita (Cordoba) is the largest natural salt lake in which South American country?\nAnswer:\nArxintina\nPassage:\nFanta\nFanta is a global brand of fruit-flavored carbonated soft drinks created by The Coca-Cola Company. There are over 100 flavors worldwide. The drink originated in Nazi Germany under trade embargo for Coca-Cola ingredients in 1940.\n\nHistory \n\nFanta originated as a result of difficulties importing Coca-Cola syrup into Nazi Germany during World War II due to a trade embargo. To circumvent this, Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola Deutschland (Coca-Cola GmbH) during the Second World War, decided to create a new product for the German market, using only ingredients available in Germany at the time, including whey and apple pomace\u00a0\u2013 the \"leftovers of leftovers\", as Keith later recalled.  The name was the result of a brief brainstorming session, which started with Keith's exhorting his team to \"use their imagination\" (Fantasie in German), to which one of his salesmen, Joe Knipp, immediately retorted \"Fanta!\"\n\nThe plant was effectively cut off from Coca-Cola headquarters during the war. After the war, the Coca-Cola corporation regained control of the plant, formula and the trademarks to the new Fanta product\u2014as well as the plant profits made during the war.\n\nFanta was discontinued when the parent company was reunited with the German branch.  Following the launch of several drinks by the Pepsi corporation in the 1950s, Coca-Cola competed by relaunching Fanta in 1955.  The drink was heavily marketed in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. \n\nMarketing \n\nUnited States \n\nFanta is known for its upbeat advertising; in the United States, it showcases The Fantanas, a group of young female models, each of whom promotes an individual Fanta flavor. For the re-introduction of Fanta in the United States, Coca-Cola worked with the ad agency Ogilvy (NYC) in 2001. After a brainstorming session, the Ogilvy creative team of Andrea Scaglione, Andrew Ladden and Bill Davaris, created the tagline \"Wanta Fanta!\" which became the jingle for the Fantanas in the broadcast campaign. The campaign lasted from summer 2001, in the form of a successful trial run, to October 1, 2006. Three years later, in June 2009, Fanta re-launched the campaign. They also held a talent search to find the pineapple Fantana, and, in September selected Shakira Barrera to become the fourth Fantana.  After Barrera won the search, she spent a year at her post, with the latter six months as an actual Fantana called Lily.\n\nInternational availability \n\nThere are over 90 different flavors worldwide. In Serbia, Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and some other countries, there is \"Fanta Shokata\" (a wordplay between \"soc\" -elderberry in Romanian- and \"shock\") based on an elderflower blossom extract drink, traditional in Romania (where it is called Socat\u0103), Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and other Balkan countries.\n\nOrange Fanta is also available in Canada; however, the formula for Canada's Orange variant differs from its American and German/European counterparts, notably in that the German contains orange juice,  the Canadian contains tangerine juice  and the American contains neither.  The other variants available in Canada are Grape and Cream Soda, both made with real grapes. \n\nPrimary competitors to Fanta have included Tango, Mirinda, Slice, Sumol, Crush, Tropicana Twister and Orangina. Fanta was the second drink to be produced by Coca-Cola, after the original Coca-Cola.\n\nInternational popularity \n\n*In Australia, there are Fanta Labs in many shopping malls. Fanta Lab provides 2 identical \"Labs\" where there is a set of water filter cups to the side and a touch screen, which shows the four available Australian flavors, Mango-Passionfruit, Orange, Grape, and Raspberry, and can choose 4 flavors to be mixed. Therefore, can mix 2 flavors twice, 3 flavors, 4 flavors, or just get a free cup of original Fanta.\n* In Japan, the market often issues seasonal rare flavours like yuzu.\n* In Greece you can find a non-carbonated version of the original Orange Fanta, called Fanta Blue\n\nControversy \n\nA 2005 British television advertisement for Fanta Z showed a couple enjoying a picnic on a beach and drinking from their cans of Fanta Light, but then calmly spitting the drink out. Others were also shown spitting the drink out in similar ways. The viewers complained that the ad condoned spitting and that children were reported to have copied the ad. A head teacher said that children in the playground had mimicked the commercial. The majority of complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the images were disgusting and thought it was inappropriate because spitting posed a health risk. The ad became restricted to the post-9pm broadcasts. The ASA agreed that viewers would not want children to see something perceived as anti-social, but did not consider that the images showing people spitting would cause widespread offense or pose a significant health risk. \n\n75th anniversary advertisement \n\nIn February 2015, a 75th anniversary version of Fanta was released in Germany. Packaged in glass bottles evoking the original design and with an authentic original war-time flavor including 30% whey and pomace, it is described on the packaging as \"less sweet\" and a German original. An associated television ad referenced the history of the drink and said the Coca-Cola company wanted to bring back \"the feeling of the Good Old Times\" which was interpreted by many to mean Nazi rule. The ad was subsequently replaced.\nQuestion:\nFanta Four are one of what country's top hip hop bands?\nAnswer:\nUnited States of Germany\nPassage:\nCyclades\nThe Cyclades (; ,) are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece. They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean archipelago. The name refers to the islands around (\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2) the sacred island of Delos. The Cyclades is where the native Greek breed of cat (the Aegean cat) originated.\n\nHistory\n\nThe significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age (\"Minoan\") culture arose in Crete, to the south: these figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.\n\nA distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer wheat and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Saliagos and Kephala (on Keos) with signs of copper-working, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.\n\nArchaeology\n\nThe first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898\u20131899 and coined the term \"Cycladic civilization\". Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by Jean Arp or Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these Cycladic figurines has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic frying pans. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from Asia Minor c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.\u00a0 3300 \u2013 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is called Helladic culture.\n\nIn recent decades the Cyclades islands have become popular with European and other tourists, and as a result there have been problems with erosion, pollution, and water shortages.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being Amorgos, Anafi, Andros, Antiparos, Delos, Eschati, Ios, Kea, Kimolos, Kythnos, Milos, Mykonos, Naxos, Paros, Folegandros, Serifos, Sifnos, Sikinos, Syros, Tinos, and Thira or Santor\u00edni. The name \"Cyclades\" refers to the islands forming a circle (\"circular islands\") around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.\n\nErmoupolis, on Syros, is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.\n\nThe islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two volcanic islands, Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes wine, fruit, wheat, olive oil, and tobacco.  Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather.\n\nThe Cyclades are bounded to the south by the Sea of Crete. \n\nAdministration\n\nThe Cyclades Prefecture () was one of the prefectures of Greece. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine regional units of the South Aegean region:\n* Andros\n* Kea-Kythnos\n* Milos\n* Mykonos\n* Naxos\n* Paros\n* Santorini\n* Syros\n* Tinos\n\nMunicipalities and communities\n\nThe prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well. \n \n\nProvinces\n\n* Province of Amorgos: Amorgos\n* Province of Andros: Andros\n* Province of Kea: Ioulis\n* Province of Milos: Milos\n* Province of Naxos: Naxos\n* Province of Paros: Paroikia\n* Province of Syros: Ermoupoli\n* Province of Tinos: Tinos\n* Province of Thera: Thera\n\nNote: Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.\n\nCuisine\n\nLocal specialities of the Cyclades include:\n\n* Brantada\n* Fava Santorinis\n* Fourtalia (Andros)\n* Kalasouna (Naxos)\n* Kalogeros (Naxos)\n* Kakavia (soup)\n* Ladopita\n* Louza, similar to the Cypriot lountza\n* Mastelo (Sifnos)\n* Strapatsada\n* Lazarakia (dessert)\n* Melopita (dessert)\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephone\n\n* 22810: Syros, including Kythnos, Serifos and Syros islands\n* 22820: Andros\n* 22830: Tinos\n* 22840: Paros and Sifnos islands\n* 22850: Amorgos and Naxos islands\n* 22860: Folegandros, Ios, Santorini and Sikinos islands\n* 22870: Kimolos and Milos\n* 22880: Kea Island\n* 22890: Mykonos\nQuestion:\nThe Cyclades are an eastern island group of which nation?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nSpinach - Produce Depot\n\u2022 Excellent source of vitamin K.\n\u2022 Great source of Vitamin A\n\u2022 Good source of manganese, folate, and vitamin C\n\u2022 Source of Iron, Magnesium and Potassium\nIn animal studies, researchers have found that spinach may help protect the brain from oxidative stress and may reduce the effects of age-related related declines in brain function. Research indicates that eating a spinach rich diet significantly improved learning capacity and motor skills in adults.\nChoosing & Storing:\nChoose spinach that has vibrant deep green leaves and stems with no signs of yellowing. The leaves should look fresh and tender, and not be wilted or bruised. Store fresh spinach loosely packed in a plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper where it will keep fresh for about five days. Do not wash it before storing as the moisture will cause it to spoil. Avoid storing cooked spinach as it will not keep very well.\n\u00a0\nTips for Preparing Spinach:\u00a0\nSpinach should be washed very well since the leaves and stems tend to collect sand and soil. Before washing, trim off the roots and separate the leaves. Cut away any overly thick stems to ensure for more even cooking.\nSpinach can be quick boiled for one minute. Boiling will help to reduce the amount of oxalic acids found in spinach, resulting in a sweeter taste.\nAdd layers of steamed spinach to your next lasagna recipe.\nToss steamed spinach with pressed garlic, fresh lemon juice and olive oil.\nSprinkle with a little Parmesan cheese.\nReplace spinach for basil in pesto recipes and make spinach pesto.\nSpinach salads are a classic easy and delicious meal or side dish.\nfooter.php\nQuality and Variety\nAt Produce Depot we take pride in providing our                      customers with the freshest fruit and vegetables available.

It now is only forested in some wooded areas, such as Radnor Wood, though a fairly large area of forest exists on the Wales\u2013England border north of Anchor (the planted Ceri Forest).\n\nThe ancient Offa's Dyke runs north-south through the area (and can be walked by the Offa's Dyke Path).\n\nIt is a deanery of the Church of England's Diocese of Hereford. \n\nA Shropshire Lad \n\nA. E. Housman wrote as part of his series of poems A Shropshire Lad:\n\n    \"In valleys of springs of rivers      \n       By Ony and Teme and Clun,          \n    The country for easy livers,          \n       The quietest under the sun...\n\n    'Tis a long way further than Knighton,\n       A quieter place than Clun,         \n    Where doomsday may thunder and lighten\n       And little 'twill matter to one.\"\nQuestion:\nClun Forest lies in which English county?\nAnswer:\nSalopia\nPassage:\nTongue and groove\nA strong joint, the tongue and groove joint is widely used for re-entrant angles. The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded.  In expensive cabinet work, glued dovetail and multiple tongue and groove are used.\n\nTongue and groove is a method of fitting similar objects together, edge to edge, used mainly with wood, in flooring, parquetry, panelling, and similar constructions. Tongue and groove joints allow two flat pieces to be joined strongly together to make a single flat surface. Before plywood became common, tongue and groove boards were also used for sheathing buildings and to construct concrete formwork.\n\nEach piece has a slot (the groove) cut all along one edge, and a thin, deep ridge (the tongue) on the opposite edge. The tongue projects a little less than the depth of the groove. Two or more pieces thus fit together closely. The joint is not normally glued, as shrinkage would then pull the tongue off.\n\nIn another assembly method, the pieces are end-matched. This method eliminates the need for mitre joints, face nailing, and the use of joints on 16 inch or 24 inch centres of conventional framing.\n\nFor many uses, tongue and groove boards have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of plywood and later composite wood boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality.  Plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for sub-floors used in platform framing is often supplied with tongue and groove edges.\n\nWhen joining thicker materials, several tongue and groove joints may be used one above the other.\n\nMethods\n\nOne of the following woodworking tools may be used to produce the tongue and groove:\n* A four- or six-head moulder (for large quantities)\n* A wood shaper (spindle moulder)\n* A circular saw bench\n* Suitable hand planes: a plough plane for the groove and a tongue plane for the tongue, or a combination plane\n* A spindle router\n\nTongue-in-groove\n\nTongue-in-groove is similar to tongue and groove, but instead of the tongue forming part of one of the edges, it is a separate, loose piece that fits between two identically grooved edges. The tongue may or may not be of the same material as the grooved pieces joined by the tongue. For example, plywood flooring is commonly grooved at the edges, and plastic tongues are used to form the joint.\nQuestion:\nA tongue and groove joint is used when working with what material?\nAnswer:\nDiffuse-porous wood\nPassage:\nSenegal\nSenegal (;   ), officially the Republic of Senegal (), is a country located in West Africa. Senegal is bordered by the North African country of Mauritania in the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast, and Guinea-Bissau to the southwest. Senegal further borders the country of The Gambia, a sovereign enclave occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the Gambia river, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with the country of Cape Verde. Senegal's economical and political capital is Dakar. It is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia,  and owes its name to the Senegal River, which borders it to the east and north. The name \"Senegal\" comes from the Wolof \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"Our Boat.\" Senegal covers a land area of almost 197000 km2}} and has an estimated population of about 13 million. The climate is Sahelian, but there is a rainy season.\n\nCultures and influences \n\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since the Prehistory. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the Jolof Empire. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, phosphate mining, fertilizer production, petroleum refining, construction materials, ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including peanuts, sugarcane, cotton, green beans, tomatoes, melons, and mangoes.Ndiaye, Mbalo.

Like the advertising posters which came before them, posters from the First World War were designed to motivate the viewer to enlist in the army, or to buy a war bond.\u00a0 They also had a secondary imperative: to inspire the viewer.\u00a0 In fact, in the United States, posters were part of a campaign of salesmanship to get the American public behind the war.\u00a0 American Posters used figures like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and Lady Liberty allegorically.\u00a0 French Bond Posters used Marianne.\nSilver coin featuring Marianne\nMarianne is the personification of the Republique Francaise and a symbol of liberty and freedom.\u00a0 Images of Marianne first appear in 1775 and depict her standing, young and determined, sometimes bare breasted as she leads soldiers into battle.\u00a0 Her image is allegorical, and is inspired by another allegorical figure, that of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and war.\nThe figure was used on the French postage stamp in 1849, and also on the franc.\u00a0 Today she appears on the French Euro coin.\u00a0 We encounter Marianne occasionally in the advertising poster.\nAdvertising poster for Saponite Laundry Soap, featuring Marianne berating a seated Napoleon\nShe is, however, best enjoyed in the poster in French World War One Bond and Reconstruction posters.\nM.

The intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian (zero degrees latitude and longitude) is in the gulf.\n\nAmong the many rivers that drain into the Gulf of Guinea are the Niger and the Volta. The coastline on the gulf includes the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny.\n\nThe Niger River in particular deposited organic sediments out to sea over millions of years which became crude oil. The Gulf of Guinea region, along with the Congo River delta and Angola further south, are expected to provide around a quarter of the United States' oil imports by 2015. This region is now regarded as one of the world's top oil and gas exploration hotspots.\n\nName\n\nThe origin of the name Guinea is thought to be an area in the region, although the specifics are disputed. Bovill (1995) gives a thorough description: \n\nThe name Guinea is usually said to have been a corrupt form of the name Ghana, picked up by the Portuguese in the Maghrib. The present writer finds this unacceptable. The name Guinea has been in use both in the Maghrib and in Europe long before Prince Henry's time. For example, on a map dated about 1320 by the Genoese cartographer Giovanni di Carignano, who got his information about Africa from a fellow-countryman in Sijilmas [ancient trading city in North Africa], we find Gunuia, and in the Catalan atlas of 1375 as Ginyia. A passage in Leo [Africanus] (vol. III, 822) points to Guinea having been a corrupt form of Jenne [2,000-year-old city in central Mali on Niger river], less famous than Ghana but nevertheless for many centuries famed in the Maghrib as a great market and a seat of learning. The relevant passage reads: \"The Kingdom of Ghinea . . . called by the merchants of our nation Gheneoa, by the natural inhabitants thereof Genni and by the Portugals and other people of Europe Ghinea.\" But it seems more probable that Guinea derives from aguinaou, the Berber for Negro. Marrakech [city in southeastern Morocco] has a gate, built in the twelfth century, called the Bab Aguinaou, the Gate of the Negro (Delafosse, Haut-S\u00e9n\u00e9gal-Niger, II, 277-278). The modern application of the name Guinea to the coast dates only from 1481. In that year the Portuguese built a fort, S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina (modern day Elmina), on the Gold Coast region, and their king, John II, was permitted by the Pope [Sixtus II or Innocent VIII] to style himself Lord of Guinea, a title that survived until the recent extinction of the monarchy.\n\nThe name \"Guinea\" was also applied to south coast of West Africa, north of the Gulf of Guinea, which became known as \"Upper Guinea\", and the west coast of Southern Africa, to the east, which became known as \"Lower Guinea.\" The name \"Guinea\" is still attached to the names of three countries in Africa: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea, as well as New Guinea in Melanesia.\n\nGeography\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southwest extent of the Gulf of Guinea as \"A line running Southeastward from Cape Three Points in Western region Ghana () to Cape Lopez in Gabon ()\". \n\nIslands in the Gulf of Guinea\n\nThe Gulf of Guinea contains a number of islands, the largest of which are in a southwest-northeast chain, forming part of the Cameroon line of volcanoes.\n\nAnnob\u00f3n\n\nAnnob\u00f3n, also known as Pagalu or Pigalu, is an island that is part of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nBobowasi Island\n\nBobowasi Island is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Western region Ghana.\n\nBioko\n\nBioko is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nCorisco\n\nCorisco is an island belonging to Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThe Elobeys\n\nElobey Grande and Elobey Chico are two small islands belonging to Equatorial Guinea.\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (officially the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe) is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea that became independent from Portugal in 1975. It is located off the western equatorial coast of Africa and consists of two islands, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. They are located about 140 km apart and about 250 and, respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon. Both islands are part of an extinct volcanic mountain range. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, the sizeable southern island, is situated just north of the Equator.\nQuestion:\nWhich major river empties into the Gulf of Guinea?\nAnswer:\nNiger Republic\nPassage:\nMar Chiquita Lake (C\u00f3rdoba)\nMar Chiquita (in Spanish literally \"Little Sea\") or Mar de Ansenuza is an endorheic salt lake located in the northeast of the province of C\u00f3rdoba, in central Argentina. The northeast corner of the lake also extends into southeastern Santiago del Estero Province. It is the largest of the naturally occurring saline lakes in Argentina. The lake is located in parts of five departments in the two provinces.\n\nThe lake occupies the southern part of a depression that measures about 50 miles/80\u00a0km (north\u2013south) by 28 miles/45\u00a0km (east\u2013west). Its surface area varies considerably, given its shallow depth (about 10 m), and ranges between 2000 and 6000\u00a0km\u00b2 (1242 and 3728\u00a0mi\u00b2).\n\nMar Chiquita is fed primarily by the saline waters of the Dulce River, coming from Santiago del Estero in the north after being joined by the Saladillo River. The lands around the lower course of the Dulce and Mar Chiquita are wetlands, populated by a large biodiversity (especially aquatic birds). From the southwest the lake receives the flow of the Primero/Suqu\u00eda and the Segundo/Xanaes rivers, as well as several streams; these inflows vary greatly from dry to rainy seasons. The salinity of Mar Chiquita is quite variable, with measured extremes ranging from 250 g/l in times of low water levels to around 40 g/l in very humid years, such as in the decade following 1977, when record rainfall flooded much of Miramar, C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nThere are several islands in the lake, the most important one being the M\u00e9dano Island. Mar Chiquita is slowly diminishing in volume due to increased evaporation and elevation of its bottom, and is ultimately bound to turn into a salt flat. The lake was formerly home to a growing tourism industry, and was the site of the Gran Hotel Vienna, a luxurious, lakefront establishment which functioned from 1945 to 1980, and has been the center of numerous mysteries and controversies.\nQuestion:\nMar Chiquita (Cordoba) is the largest natural salt lake in which South American country?\nAnswer:\nArxintina\nPassage:\nFanta\nFanta is a global brand of fruit-flavored carbonated soft drinks created by The Coca-Cola Company. There are over 100 flavors worldwide. The drink originated in Nazi Germany under trade embargo for Coca-Cola ingredients in 1940.\n\nHistory \n\nFanta originated as a result of difficulties importing Coca-Cola syrup into Nazi Germany during World War II due to a trade embargo. To circumvent this, Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola Deutschland (Coca-Cola GmbH) during the Second World War, decided to create a new product for the German market, using only ingredients available in Germany at the time, including whey and apple pomace\u00a0\u2013 the \"leftovers of leftovers\", as Keith later recalled.  The name was the result of a brief brainstorming session, which started with Keith's exhorting his team to \"use their imagination\" (Fantasie in German), to which one of his salesmen, Joe Knipp, immediately retorted \"Fanta!\"\n\nThe plant was effectively cut off from Coca-Cola headquarters during the war. After the war, the Coca-Cola corporation regained control of the plant, formula and the trademarks to the new Fanta product\u2014as well as the plant profits made during the war.\n\nFanta was discontinued when the parent company was reunited with the German branch.  Following the launch of several drinks by the Pepsi corporation in the 1950s, Coca-Cola competed by relaunching Fanta in 1955.  The drink was heavily marketed in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. \n\nMarketing \n\nUnited States \n\nFanta is known for its upbeat advertising; in the United States, it showcases The Fantanas, a group of young female models, each of whom promotes an individual Fanta flavor. For the re-introduction of Fanta in the United States, Coca-Cola worked with the ad agency Ogilvy (NYC) in 2001. After a brainstorming session, the Ogilvy creative team of Andrea Scaglione, Andrew Ladden and Bill Davaris, created the tagline \"Wanta Fanta!\" which became the jingle for the Fantanas in the broadcast campaign. The campaign lasted from summer 2001, in the form of a successful trial run, to October 1, 2006. Three years later, in June 2009, Fanta re-launched the campaign. They also held a talent search to find the pineapple Fantana, and, in September selected Shakira Barrera to become the fourth Fantana.  After Barrera won the search, she spent a year at her post, with the latter six months as an actual Fantana called Lily.\n\nInternational availability \n\nThere are over 90 different flavors worldwide. In Serbia, Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and some other countries, there is \"Fanta Shokata\" (a wordplay between \"soc\" -elderberry in Romanian- and \"shock\") based on an elderflower blossom extract drink, traditional in Romania (where it is called Socat\u0103), Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and other Balkan countries.\n\nOrange Fanta is also available in Canada; however, the formula for Canada's Orange variant differs from its American and German/European counterparts, notably in that the German contains orange juice,  the Canadian contains tangerine juice  and the American contains neither.  The other variants available in Canada are Grape and Cream Soda, both made with real grapes. \n\nPrimary competitors to Fanta have included Tango, Mirinda, Slice, Sumol, Crush, Tropicana Twister and Orangina. Fanta was the second drink to be produced by Coca-Cola, after the original Coca-Cola.\n\nInternational popularity \n\n*In Australia, there are Fanta Labs in many shopping malls. Fanta Lab provides 2 identical \"Labs\" where there is a set of water filter cups to the side and a touch screen, which shows the four available Australian flavors, Mango-Passionfruit, Orange, Grape, and Raspberry, and can choose 4 flavors to be mixed. Therefore, can mix 2 flavors twice, 3 flavors, 4 flavors, or just get a free cup of original Fanta.\n* In Japan, the market often issues seasonal rare flavours like yuzu.\n* In Greece you can find a non-carbonated version of the original Orange Fanta, called Fanta Blue\n\nControversy \n\nA 2005 British television advertisement for Fanta Z showed a couple enjoying a picnic on a beach and drinking from their cans of Fanta Light, but then calmly spitting the drink out. Others were also shown spitting the drink out in similar ways. The viewers complained that the ad condoned spitting and that children were reported to have copied the ad. A head teacher said that children in the playground had mimicked the commercial. The majority of complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the images were disgusting and thought it was inappropriate because spitting posed a health risk. The ad became restricted to the post-9pm broadcasts. The ASA agreed that viewers would not want children to see something perceived as anti-social, but did not consider that the images showing people spitting would cause widespread offense or pose a significant health risk. \n\n75th anniversary advertisement \n\nIn February 2015, a 75th anniversary version of Fanta was released in Germany. Packaged in glass bottles evoking the original design and with an authentic original war-time flavor including 30% whey and pomace, it is described on the packaging as \"less sweet\" and a German original. An associated television ad referenced the history of the drink and said the Coca-Cola company wanted to bring back \"the feeling of the Good Old Times\" which was interpreted by many to mean Nazi rule. The ad was subsequently replaced.\nQuestion:\nFanta Four are one of what country's top hip hop bands?\nAnswer:\nUnited States of Germany\nPassage:\nCyclades\nThe Cyclades (; ,) are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece. They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean archipelago. The name refers to the islands around (\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2) the sacred island of Delos. The Cyclades is where the native Greek breed of cat (the Aegean cat) originated.\n\nHistory\n\nThe significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age (\"Minoan\") culture arose in Crete, to the south: these figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.\n\nA distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer wheat and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Saliagos and Kephala (on Keos) with signs of copper-working, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.\n\nArchaeology\n\nThe first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898\u20131899 and coined the term \"Cycladic civilization\". Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by Jean Arp or Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these Cycladic figurines has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic frying pans. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from Asia Minor c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.\u00a0 3300 \u2013 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is called Helladic culture.\n\nIn recent decades the Cyclades islands have become popular with European and other tourists, and as a result there have been problems with erosion, pollution, and water shortages.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being Amorgos, Anafi, Andros, Antiparos, Delos, Eschati, Ios, Kea, Kimolos, Kythnos, Milos, Mykonos, Naxos, Paros, Folegandros, Serifos, Sifnos, Sikinos, Syros, Tinos, and Thira or Santor\u00edni. The name \"Cyclades\" refers to the islands forming a circle (\"circular islands\") around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.\n\nErmoupolis, on Syros, is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.\n\nThe islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two volcanic islands, Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes wine, fruit, wheat, olive oil, and tobacco.  Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather.\n\nThe Cyclades are bounded to the south by the Sea of Crete. \n\nAdministration\n\nThe Cyclades Prefecture () was one of the prefectures of Greece. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine regional units of the South Aegean region:\n* Andros\n* Kea-Kythnos\n* Milos\n* Mykonos\n* Naxos\n* Paros\n* Santorini\n* Syros\n* Tinos\n\nMunicipalities and communities\n\nThe prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well. \n \n\nProvinces\n\n* Province of Amorgos: Amorgos\n* Province of Andros: Andros\n* Province of Kea: Ioulis\n* Province of Milos: Milos\n* Province of Naxos: Naxos\n* Province of Paros: Paroikia\n* Province of Syros: Ermoupoli\n* Province of Tinos: Tinos\n* Province of Thera: Thera\n\nNote: Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.\n\nCuisine\n\nLocal specialities of the Cyclades include:\n\n* Brantada\n* Fava Santorinis\n* Fourtalia (Andros)\n* Kalasouna (Naxos)\n* Kalogeros (Naxos)\n* Kakavia (soup)\n* Ladopita\n* Louza, similar to the Cypriot lountza\n* Mastelo (Sifnos)\n* Strapatsada\n* Lazarakia (dessert)\n* Melopita (dessert)\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephone\n\n* 22810: Syros, including Kythnos, Serifos and Syros islands\n* 22820: Andros\n* 22830: Tinos\n* 22840: Paros and Sifnos islands\n* 22850: Amorgos and Naxos islands\n* 22860: Folegandros, Ios, Santorini and Sikinos islands\n* 22870: Kimolos and Milos\n* 22880: Kea Island\n* 22890: Mykonos\nQuestion:\nThe Cyclades are an eastern island group of which nation?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nSpinach - Produce Depot\n\u2022 Excellent source of vitamin K.\n\u2022 Great source of Vitamin A\n\u2022 Good source of manganese, folate, and vitamin C\n\u2022 Source of Iron, Magnesium and Potassium\nIn animal studies, researchers have found that spinach may help protect the brain from oxidative stress and may reduce the effects of age-related related declines in brain function. Research indicates that eating a spinach rich diet significantly improved learning capacity and motor skills in adults.\nChoosing & Storing:\nChoose spinach that has vibrant deep green leaves and stems with no signs of yellowing. The leaves should look fresh and tender, and not be wilted or bruised. Store fresh spinach loosely packed in a plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper where it will keep fresh for about five days. Do not wash it before storing as the moisture will cause it to spoil. Avoid storing cooked spinach as it will not keep very well.\n\u00a0\nTips for Preparing Spinach:\u00a0\nSpinach should be washed very well since the leaves and stems tend to collect sand and soil. Before washing, trim off the roots and separate the leaves. Cut away any overly thick stems to ensure for more even cooking.\nSpinach can be quick boiled for one minute. Boiling will help to reduce the amount of oxalic acids found in spinach, resulting in a sweeter taste.\nAdd layers of steamed spinach to your next lasagna recipe.\nToss steamed spinach with pressed garlic, fresh lemon juice and olive oil.\nSprinkle with a little Parmesan cheese.\nReplace spinach for basil in pesto recipes and make spinach pesto.\nSpinach salads are a classic easy and delicious meal or side dish.\nfooter.php\nQuality and Variety\nAt Produce Depot we take pride in providing our                      customers with the freshest fruit and vegetables available.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nLily Munster\nLily Munster, Countess of Shroudshire (n\u00e9e Dracula), is a fictional character in the CBS sitcom, The Munsters, originally played by Yvonne De Carlo.  The matriarch of the Munster household, Lily is a vampire. The role was later played by Lee Meriwether in The Munsters Today and by Portia de Rossi in Mockingbird Lane.\n\nIn the original unaired color pilot her name was Phoebe Munster.\n\nOrigins\n\nLily was born in 1827 to Sam Dracula (Grandpa) and his 166th wife (referred to only as \"Grandma\"). She lived with Grandpa for some time in Transylvania (a region in Romania) before meeting Herman Munster and marrying him in 1865. She, Grandpa, and Herman moved to America sometime before the mid-1940s and adopted her sister's child, Marilyn. In the mid-1950s, she gave birth to Eddie, her and Herman's only child.\n\nHer name is presumably derived from the tradition of the lily as a flower of death, or a vague reference to Lilith, a female demon of Jewish mythology.\n\nDescription\n\nLily is the matriarch of the Munster family. She is very close with her niece, Marilyn. She has a werewolf for a brother, who appears in one episode, and a sister who is mentioned a few times who is Marilyn's mother. Lily is the voice of reason in the Munster household, often relied upon to set problems right, and typically mediates when Herman and Grandpa squabble.\n\nLily also has a fiery temper. While she is deeply in love with Herman (\"Pussycat,\" as she calls him), she also frequently gets very angry at him (due to his frequent stupidity and occasional selfishness), and Herman often meekly discloses his fear (to others) of being on the receiving end of her wrath. She also has reprimanded her own father (Grandpa) on several occasions for his own foolish actions and stubborn self-righteousness.\n\nLily treats her niece Marilyn as her own daughter, but shares the family's concern that Marilyn's \"hideousness\" is going to condemn her to a spinster's life. As such, she is very much in favor of Marilyn dating, and is very accommodating to Marilyn's fleeting beaus despite their \"rudeness.\" (What Lily is perceiving as lack of manners is in fact the young man's terror of seeing Marilyn's monstrous relatives).\n\nLily is very supportive of her son, Eddie, and keeps a close eye on his activities and social circle.\n\nLily is mainly a housewife, and her duties include spreading garbage around the mansion and \"dusting\" with a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse so that it blows dirt about in the nine-room-and-a-dungeon house. During the course of the series, Lily works as a welder in a shipyard, a fashion model, and a palm reader in a tea room. In one episode she forces Herman to give her money so that she and Marilyn can open a beauty parlor, but this soon goes out of business, as Lily assumes her clientele wants to look more like her. These part-time jobs never seem to stick, and Lily would be back to being a homemaker by the next episode.\n\nLily is a beautiful and slender woman who appears to be in her middle age years, although she is actually hundreds of years old.  Later incarnations of the character, played by different actresses, would change her skin from green to pale white. A white streak in her hair recalls the monster's mate from Bride of Frankenstein. Lily usually dresses in an ankle-length pale pink gown that appears faded and old, and she sometimes also wears a scarf. Her necklace features a bat-shaped medallion. When away from the Munster house, she sometimes wears a long silver cape with a hood. In the episode \"Munsters Masquerade\", Lily demonstrates the ability to float in the air while dancing.\n\nTrue to her vampire nature, when Lily sleeps she resembles a corpse: ramrod straight and fingers cradled on her chest, even holding a lily (flower) between her fingers. However, like her father, she casts a reflection, sleeps at night and has no problems going out in the daylight (although she wears her heavy cape and hood), despite the two being vampires. She also never is shown to be craving blood or attempting to bite a mortal, like Grandpa occasionally does.\n\nDevelopment\n\nLily was not in the original pilot episode of The Munsters. Instead, Herman is married to a much more Gothic-looking wife named Phoebe, played by Joan Marshall. The producers scrapped the Phoebe character after deciding she seemed almost an exact double of the Morticia Addams character on The Addams Family. Lily appeared in the second pilot and all other episodes. In the pilot, the Phoebe character was depicted as more goth in nature, and also has a somewhat abrasive bickering relationship with Herman and a strained relationship with Eddie, both elements toned down with Lily.\n\nYvonne De Carlo was cast for the role in March 1964. When first cast, Gwynne and Lewis went to the producers and complained because De Carlo was a movie star of long standing and they were worried that she would not fit in. However, after a few shows, they had to admit they had been wrong, and all got on well.\n\nNotes\n\n* Note A:  Her age at the beginning of Season 1. This does not take into account the fact that she is undead, and thus has some unknown date of death.\nQuestion:\nWhat was Lily Munster's maiden name?\nAnswer:\nKretzulesco\nPassage:\nWhen You Walk in the Room\n\"When You Walk in the Room\" is a song written and recorded by Jackie DeShannon, first released by her in 1963 but covered by many artists. The lyrics of the song attempt to detail the singer's emotions when in the presence of the person he or she loves. There is also an expression of frustration by the singer that he or she cannot manage to tell that person of his or her love.\n\nJackie DeShannon version\n\nDeShannon's original version was released as a single on November 23, 1963.  as the B-Side to \"Till You Say You'll Be Mine\". It was later rereleased as a single A-side in September 1964, and later included on the album Breakin' It Up on the Beatles Tour. The single charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, peaking at #99. \n\nThe Searchers version\n\nThe song was recorded by The Searchers in 1964. This version became an international hit, reaching #35 in the US and #5 in the UK.\n\nAnother early hit for Jackie DeShannon, \"Needles and Pins\", written by Jack Nitzche and a little known at the time songwriter from Detroit by the name of Sonny Bono, was covered by the Searchers also.\n\nThe Searchers' version of the song would be covered by The Young Veins.\n\nStephanie Winslow version\n\nStephanie Winslow, is an American country music artist. Her version reached #29 on the U.S. country singles charts.\n\nChart positions\n\nPaul Carrack version\n\nPaul Carrack's version, from his 1987 album One Good Reason, reached number 90 in the U.S.  and number 48 in the UK. \n\nPam Tillis version\n\nIn 1994, country music artist Pam Tillis recorded a version for her 1994 album Sweetheart's Dance. Tillis' version was released as a single, reaching a peak of #2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts.  It was accompanied by a music video, featuring Dick Clark, and depicting Tillis in a mid-1960s appearance on American Bandstand.\n\nChart positions\n\nYear-end charts\n\nPersonnel\n\nCompiled from liner notes. \n* Mike Brignardello \u2014 bass guitar\n* Mary Chapin Carpenter \u2014 background vocals\n* Rob Hajacos \u2014 fiddle\n* Bob DiPiero \u2014 12-string guitar\n* Paul Franklin \u2014 steel guitar\n* George Marinelli \u2014 electric guitar\n* Steve Nathan \u2014 piano\n* Brent Mason \u2014 electric guitar\n* Kim Richey \u2014 background vocals\n* Pam Tillis \u2014 lead vocals\n* Biff Watson \u2014 acoustic guitar\n* Lonnie Wilson \u2014 drums\n\nAgnetha F\u00e4ltskog version\n\n\"When You Walk in the Room\" was the second single from Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog's 2004 album, My Colouring Book, her first in 17 years.

Open iTunes to buy and download music.\nBiography\nOne of the linchpins of the British rock & roll revival of the 1970s and '80s, Shakin' Stevens ranks among the most persistent performers ever to emerge, ultimately, as a superstar. Stevens has no less than 30 U.K. Top 40 hits to his name, almost all of them racked up during a five-year span of chart invincibility. Yet his recording career pre-dated his first hit by over a decade, struggling through a period that might have forced any less committed artist to simply abandon all hope.  \"Shaky\" was born Michael Barratt on March 4, 1948 in Ely, Wales. The youngest of 11 children and a keen amateur singer, he was already married and working as a milkman when he formed Shakin' Stevens & the Sunsets, his first professional band, in 1968. The bandmembers themselves had been playing together in one form or another since the late '50s (when they formed as the Backbeats), and knew Stevens as one of their most devoted fans; he would often join them on-stage to perform a guest vocal or two. With a ferocious live following around South Wales, the band signed to Parlophone in 1970 and recorded its debut album, the optimistically titled A Legend, with producer Dave Edmunds. Reports that they also opened for the Rolling Stones in December 1969 appear to be exaggerated, but the band gigged regularly around Germany and Holland, and scored several European hit singles.  Still, they seemed doomed to haunt the rock & roll revival circuit, all the more so after Stevens was cast in impresario Jack Good's musical Elvis in 1977 (he appeared as the Army-era King), and the band was forced into hiatus for the duration of the play's six-month run. Worse was to come (for the group), however, as Elvis went on to become one of the year's biggest musicals. Stevens' run was extended to two years, and exploding media attention made it clear that Shaky would not be returning to South Wales anytime soon. Stevens quit the Sunsets in late 1979 and, as a solo performer, was signed briefly to Track Records. However, three singles and the Play Loud LP were lost when the label went bankrupt and, while Stevens quickly bounced back, signing to CBS in 1980. His first attempt at recording an album for the label ended with rejection.  A role in Jack Good's reborn Oh Boy TV series kept Stevens at the forefront, however, and the CBS subsidiary Epic picked him up. Three singles flopped, but in February 1980 Stevens finally scored his first U.K. hit when a version of Buck Owens' \"Hot Dog\" reached number 24. \"Marie Marie,\" a Top 20 hit, arrived that summer, and the following February, Stevens enjoyed his first U.K. chart-topper, \"This Ole House.\" The follow-up, \"You Drive Me Crazy,\" reached number two, before \"Green Door\" returned him to the top. Thereafter, the hits flew thick and fast; further chart-toppers \"Oh Julie\" (1982) and \"Merry Christmas Everyone\" (1985) sandwiched such smashes as \"Shirley,\" \"Give Me Your Heart Tonight,\" \"I'll Be Satisfied,\" \"Blue Christmas,\" \"Cry Just a Little Bit,\" and many more.   A 1985 reunion with the Sunsets' first producer, Dave Edmunds, resulted in the Lipstick Powder & Paint LP (Edmunds also handled the Christmas number one), while Stevens' other albums included the Top Three successes This Ole House and Shaky (both 1981) and Give Me Your Heart Tonight (1982). There was even chart action for his early-'70s work with the Sunsets, gathered up on the 1981 compilation Shakin' Stevens. Litigation relating to this material would pursue Stevens through the remainder of the   80s and into the '90s, as his former bandmates battled over unpaid royalties. The hits grew smaller as the '80s progressed; his final U.K. Top Five entry was a revival of \"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For\" in 1987; other singles struggled to even approach the peaks Shaky had once dominated, and in 1993, Stevens retired from recording and performing. His final hit, the previous year's \"Radio,\" was recorded with Queen's Roger Taylor and reached number 37.  Stevens remained in retirement for six years. He was back on the live circuit in 1999, and in 2005 he returned to the U.K. chart with the hits compilation The Collection. That same year he appeared on, and won, the U.K. pop oldies reality TV show Hit Me Baby One More Time -- his victorious song, a cover of P!nk's \"Trouble,\" brought him a Top 20 hit that summer, and paved the way for his first new album in 15 years, 2007's Now Listen. The following year saw Stevens celebrate his 60th birthday with a string of major concerts around the U.K. and Europe, including an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. Another celebratory tour followed in 2011 when Stevens launched his 30th anniversary celebration and released a new album, Rockin' the Blues. Returning in 2016 with his 20th studio album, Stevens took inspiration from his own ancestral background for the much darker and Americana-influenced Echoes of Our Times. ~ Dave Thompson\nTop Albums\nQuestion:\nUnder what name did Michael Barratt have four No.1 hits in the 1980's?\nAnswer:\nShakin Stevens\nPassage:\nLord of Mann\nThe title Lord of Mann () is used on the Isle of Man to refer to the island's Lord Proprietor   and head of state. The current holder of the title is Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nRelationship with the Crown\n\nThe title is not correctly used on its own. Since 1399, the Kings and Lords of Mann existed in a position of feudality as vassals of the reigning King of England, and subsequently of Great Britain and the United Kingdom, who was the ultimate sovereign of the island. This right of 'Lord Proprietor' was revested into the Crown by the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 and hence ceased to exist separately. King George III became the first British monarch to rule the Isle of Man as 'Lord of Mann' in 1765.  However, for reasons of culture and tradition, the title Lord of Mann continues to be used. For these reasons, the correct formal usage, as used on the Isle of Man for the Loyal Toast, is The Queen, Lord of Mann.\n\nThe title is now Lord of Mann regardless of gender. However, during her reign, Queen Victoria was styled as Lady of Mann. \n\nThe formal Latin style is .\n\nList of Lords\n\nPrior to 1504, the ruler of the Isle of Man was generally styled King of Mann. \n\n16th century\n\n*Thomas, Earl of Derby, 1504\u20131521\n*Edward, Earl of Derby, 1521\u20131572\n*Henry, Earl of Derby, 1572\u20131593\n*Ferdinando, Earl of Derby, 1593\u20131594\n\nSuccession dispute (1594\u20131607)\n\nIn 1598, a succession dispute between the daughters of Ferdinando and their uncle, William, Earl of Derby was heard. It was decided by the Privy Council that the right to the Isle of Man belonged solely to Queen Elizabeth I, and the letters-patent of 1405 which have conferred the Isle of Man to the Stanley family were declared null and void as the previous ruler, Henry, Earl of Northumberland, had not been subject to legal attainder, despite his treason, and the 1405 and 1406 letters-patent had therefore not taken effect.  \n\nThe Queen, in consideration of the \"many eminent services performed to herself and to her royal predecessors by the honourable and noble House of Stanley\", withdrew her right and referred the contending claimants to the decision of the Privy Council as to the best claim of inheritance.\n\nThe Law Lords on the Privy Council decided \"the grant being by letters patent under the Great Seal of England, such right would descend according to the Common Law of England to the heirs general, and not to the heirs male\", and the island was therefore awarded to Ferdinando's daughters; whereupon William agreed to purchase their several shares and interests. \n\nThe original letters-patent having been declared void, the Parliament of England in 1609 under James I passed a Private Act of Parliament entitled \"An Act for assuring and establishing the Isle of Man in the name and blood of William, Earl of Derby\" [(1609) 7 Jac.1 c.4]  which established the title in law as Lord of Mann. The lordship was conferred by letters-patent dated 7 July 1609 upon William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby.  Subsequent succession was under the terms of this grant. \n\nInterim Lords (1607\u20131609)\n\nFollowing the resolution of the succession dispute, it was ruled that the daughters of Ferdinando Stanley were the rightful heirs. As the oldest of them would not reach the age of majority until 1609, two temporary Lords of Mann were appointed by James I, using letters patent,  so that the daughters could benefit from the Island's revenues.\n*Henry, Earl of Northampton, 1607\u20131608\n*Robert, Earl of Salisbury, 1608\u20131609\n\nFollowing the coming of age of the heirs to the Lordship of the Isle of Man, the rights over the island were sold to their uncle, William Stanley. He took up the title of Lord of Mann following the passing of an Act of Parliament. \n\n17th century\n\n*William, Earl of Derby, 1609\u20131612\n*Elizabeth, Countess of Derby, 1612\u20131627\n*James, Earl of Derby, 1627\u20131651 (known as 'the Great Stanley')\n*Thomas, Lord Fairfax of Cameron, 1651\u20131660 (appointed by Oliver Cromwell during the English Interregnum)\n*Charles, Earl of Derby, 1660\u20131672 (restored by Charles II)\n*William, Earl of Derby, 1672\u20131702\n*James, Earl of Derby, 1702\u20131736\n*James, Duke of Atholl, 1736\u20131764\n*Charlotte, Duchess of Atholl and John, Duke of Atholl,  1764\u20131765\n\nRevestment\n\nIn 1765, Charlotte Murray, Duchess of Atholl, 8th Baroness Strange, sold the suzerainty of the island to the British government for \u00a370,000 and an annuity of \u00a32,000 (\u00a35,235,000 and \u00a3150,000 respectively in modern terms). By the passage of the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 the title of Lord of Mann was revested into the British Crown. It has therefore since been used on the Isle of Man to refer to the reigning Monarch of the United Kingdom.\n\nAll remaining rights and property of the Dukes of Atholl on the island were sold to the British government in 1828 for the sum of \u00a3417,144 (over \u00a320,000,000 in modern terms).  \nThis was accomplished by two Private Acts of Parliament:\n\n* \"An Act empowering the Lords of the Treasury to Purchase all the Manorial Rights of the Duke of Atholl in the Isle of Man\" [c. 34] 10 June 1824\n* \"An Act to empower the Commissioners of His Majesty\u2019s Treasury to purchase a certain Annuity in respect of Duties and Customs levied in the Isle of Man, and any reserved sovereign rights in the said Island belonging to John Duke of Atholl\" [c. 34] 10 June 1825\nQuestion:\nWho currently holds the title of Lord of Mann ?\nAnswer:\nQueen Elizabeth II of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\nPassage:\nSunday Bloody Sunday (film)\nSunday Bloody Sunday is a 1971 British drama film written by Penelope Gilliatt, directed by John Schlesinger and starring Murray Head, Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch. It tells the story of a free-spirited young bisexual artist (played by Head) and his simultaneous relationships with a female recruitment consultant (Jackson) and a male Jewish doctor (Finch).\n\nThe film is significant for its time in that Finch's homosexual character is depicted as successful and relatively well-adjusted, and not particularly upset by his sexuality. In this sense, Sunday Bloody Sunday was a considerable departure from Schlesinger's previous film Midnight Cowboy, which had portrayed its gay characters as alienated and self-loathing, as well as other gay-themed films of the era, including Boys in the Band, and Some of My Best Friends Are....\n\nThe film was released before the 1972 shooting by the British Army of unarmed protesters in Derry, Northern Ireland, an event dubbed \"Bloody Sunday.\"\n\nSynopsis\n\nSet in London, a middle-aged Jewish doctor, Daniel Hirsh (Peter Finch), and a young woman in her mid-30s, Alex Greville (Glenda Jackson) are both involved in a love triangle with contemporary sculptor Bob Elkin (Murray Head), a younger man in his mid-20s. Not only are Hirsh and Greville both aware that Elkin is seeing the other but they know one another through common friends. Despite this, they are willing to put up with the situation through fear of losing Elkin, who switches freely between them.\n\nFor Greville, the relationship is bound up with a growing disillusionment about her professional life, failed marriage and uneasy childhood. For Hirsh, it represents an escape from the repressed nature of his Jewish upbringing. Both realise the lack of permanence about their situation and it is only when Elkin decides to leave the country to settle in New York City after receiving an offer to open his own art gallery to display and sell his artwork, that they both come face to face (for the first time in the narrative at the end). Despite their opposed situations, both Hirsh and Greville come to realize that it is time to move on and Elkin leaves for the USA.\n\nCast\n\n* Peter Finch as Dr. Daniel Hirsh\n* Glenda Jackson as Alex Greville\n* Murray Head as Bob Elkin\n* Peggy Ashcroft as Mrs. Greville\n* Tony Britton as George Harding\n* Maurice Denham as Mr. Greville\n* Bessie Love as Answering Service Lady\n* Vivian Pickles as Alva Hodson\n* Frank Windsor as Bill Hodson\n* Thomas Baptiste as Professor Johns\n* Richard Pearson as Patient\n* June Brown as Woman Patient \n* Hannah Norbert as Daniel's Mother\n* Harold Goldblatt as Daniel's Father\n* Russell Lewis as Timothy Hodson\n* Marie Burke as Aunt Astrid\n* Caroline Blakiston as Rowing Wife \n* Peter Halliday as Rowing Husband \n* Jon Finch as Scotsman\n* Robert Rietti as Daniel's Brother\n* Douglas Lambert as Man at Party \n* Nike Arrighi as Party Guest\n* Edward Evans as Husband at Hospital \n* Gabrielle Daye as Wife at Hospital\n* Petra Markham (uncredited) as Designer's girlfriend \n* Daniel Day-Lewis (uncredited) as Child vandal\n* John Warner (uncredited) as Party Guest\n\nProduction notes\n\n* Alan Bates was the original choice made by John Schlesinger for the role of Daniel Hirsh, the gay doctor. However he was held up filming The Go-Between (1970) and was replaced first by Ian Bannen, who dropped out after two weeks' filming, and later by Peter Finch. However, the role of Daniel was written as that of a much younger man.\n* Several actresses (including Dame Edith Evans and Thora Hird) politely refused the part of Glenda Jackson's mother, Mrs. Greville, because they thought the project was too risqu\u00e9. Peggy Ashcroft accepted after the director explained to her the elements of the story and she gladly signed on.\n* Ian Bannen was fired from the role of Daniel Hirsh shortly after filming began. Apparently, he was so nervous about what kissing another actor on screen might do to his career, he could not concentrate enough to even get going with the part. He later said that losing the role set back his career, and regretted it till his death.\n* Actor Daniel Day-Lewis made his film debut at the age of 14 in this film as a vandal in an uncredited role. He described the experience as \"heaven\", for getting paid \u00a32 to vandalize expensive cars parked outside his local church.\n\nMusic\n\nThe film makes extensive use of source music including a recurring motif of the trio Soave sia il vento from Mozart's opera Cos\u00ec fan tutte.\n\nReception\n\nThe film currently holds a 91% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. \n\nThis film appeared on both Roger Ebert's and Gene Siskel's Top 10 list of 1971. Listed as No. 5 and No. 6 respectively. Roger Ebert commented, \"The official East Coast line on John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday was that it is civilized. That judgment was enlisted to carry the critical defense of the movie; and, indeed, how can the decent critic be against a civilized movie about civilized people? My notion, all the same, is that Sunday Bloody Sunday is about people who suffer from psychic amputation, not civility, and that this film is not an affirmation but a tragedy...I think 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' is a masterpiece, but I don't think it's about what everybody else seems to think it's about. This is not a movie about the loss of love, but about its absence.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nSunday Bloody Sunday was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Actor (Peter Finch), Best Actress (Glenda Jackson), Best Director (John Schlesinger), and Best Original Screenplay (Penelope Gilliatt). Gilliatt won several Best Screenplay awards for the film, including the New York Film Critics Circle Award, Writers Guild of America, and Writers' Guild of Great Britain.\n\nIt won the BAFTA Award for Best Film. It also won acting honors for Finch and Jackson, as well as Best Director for Schlesinger.\nQuestion:\n\"Now among the most praised and honoured people in the film industry, who made his screen acting debut in \"\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\"\" in 1971 ?\"\nAnswer:\nDaniel Day Lewis\nPassage:\nGunn & Moore\nGunn & Moore, commonly shortened to GM, is a sports equipment and apparel company founded in 1885 based in Colwick, Nottinghamshire, England that specialises in cricket. It became part of the UNICORN GROUP in 1968. \n\nOverview\n\nGunn & Moore was founded in 1885 by English Test batsman William Gunn and local businessman Thomas James Moore,  and is most recognised for manufacturing cricket bats. \n\nThe company was originally based at 49 Carrington Street in Nottingham. \n\nThe company also manufactures clothing and a full range of other cricket equipment. Many professional cricketers use its bats and have had endorsement deals with the company, including Quinton de Kock (South Africa), Shane Watson (Australia), England's former star spinner Graeme Swann, as well as former international captains Graeme Smith (South Africa), South Africa's high profile test opener, Steve Waugh (Australia), Stephen Fleming (New Zealand), Michael Vaughan (England) and Anil Kumble (India).\nGunn & Moore bats are almost exclusively made in England, distinguishing the company others which manufacture a large percentage of their bats outside of Great Britain. Gunn and Moore use a former Mauser rifle factory copying lathe, originally used to make the stocks for small arms, to rough out the blades; the machine was brought back from Germany after World War 1.\n\nBats\n\nThe range of bats  was:\n* Six6 F4.5 DXM \n* Purist F2 DXM \n* Icon DXM (Also in F2 + F4.5) \n* Argon DXM (Also in F2)\n* Octane F2 DXM \n* Zona F2 DXM\n* GMax DXM\n* Aura DXM\n* Sigma DXM\n* Mogul F4.5 DXM\n* Maestro DXM\n* Halo DXM\n* Apex DXM\n* Epic DXM\n* Luna DXM\n* Max-E DXM\n* Hero DXM\n* Paragon DXM\n* Mana DXM\n* Maxi DXM\n\nSponsorships\n\nThe following international players have current endorsement deals with Gunn & Moore. \n\nSri Lanka\n\n* Prasanna Jayawardene - Mogul\n\nSouth Africa\n\n* Neil McKenzie - Octane\n* Robin Peterson - Icon\n* Graeme Smith - Six6\n* Quinton de Kock - Paragon\n* Vernon Philander - Mogul\n* Kyle Abbott (cricketer) - Aura\n* Dwaine Pretorius - Icon\n* Gulam Bodi - Argon\n* Richard Levi - Mogul\n* Werner Coetsee - Icon\n* Stephen Cook (cricketer) - Mana\n* Dane Vilas - Mana\n* Justin Ontong - Icon\n* Farhaan Behardien - Six6\n* Gihahn Cloete - Octane\n* Darryn Smit - Icon\n* Jean Symes - Mana\n* Johan Van Der Wath - Icon\n* Rory Kleinveldt - Mogul\n\nEngland\n\n* Michael Lumb - Six6\n* Samit Patel - Aura\n* Graeme Swann - Icon\n* James Vince - Mogul\n* Matthew Fisher (cricketer) - Octane\n* Daniel Bell-Drummond - Aura\n* Sarah Taylor - Mogul\n* Andrew Gale - Aura\n* Adam Lyth - Octane\n* Kate Cross - Six6\n* Alex Lees (cricketer) - Six6\n* Ben Duckett - Aura\n* Jenny Gunn - Six6\n* Zafar Ansari - Icon\n* Lewis Gregory - Mogul\n* Chris Read - Six6\n* Tom Fell - Six6\n* Kishen Velani - Aura\n* Amy Jones - Mogul\n* Jimmy Adams - Six6\n* Chris Dent - Octane\n* Alex Davies - Sigma\n* Donald Aneurin - Aura\n* Matthew Boyce - Icon\n* Karl Brown - Sigma\n* Nathan Buck - Sigma\n* Rory Burns - Sigma\n* Jordan Clark - Sigma\n* Ian Cockbain (cricketer, born 1987) - Sigma\n* Ryan Davies - Octane\n* Tom Fell - Six6\n* Luke Fletcher - Icon\n* Alex Gidman - Octane\n* Fynn Hudson-Prentice - Aura\n* Ateeq Javid - Icon\n* Wayne Madsen - Octane\n* Lewis McManus - Aura\n* Stephen Parry - Sigma\n* Ravi Patel - Aura\n* Luis Reece - Sigma\n* Michael Richardson - Aura\n* Adam Riley - Icon\n* Andrew Salter - Sigma\n* Ben Slater - Icon\n* Cameron Steel - Six6\n* Jonny Tattersall - Six6\n* Bard Taylor - Aura\n* Freddie van den Bergh - Argon\n* Kishen Velani - Aura\n* Max Waller - Aura\n* Graham Clark - Icon\n\nScotland\n\n* Jean Symes - Flare\n* Gordon Goudie - Six6\n\nNetherlands\n\n* Ryan ten Doeschate - Icon\n\nAustralia\n\n* James Hopes - Mogul\n* Dominic Thornely - Flare\n* Chris Matthews (cricketer) - Aura\n* Liam Davis (cricketer) - Icon\n* Alex Doolan - Six6\n* Cameron Borgas - Icon\n* Jordan Silk - Mana\n* Travis Head - Mana\n* Matt Short - Six6\n\nNew Zealand\n\n* Nathan McCullum - Aura\n* Peto Tran - Mogul\n* Dean Brownlie - Icon\n* Ross Taylor - Six6\n* Rob Nicol - Argon\n* Peter Fulton - Icon\n* Corey Anderson - Paragon\nQuestion:\nWhat do the firms Redwood, Wormwood and Gunn and Moore aii make?\nAnswer:\nMongoose bat\nPassage:\nMichael Fagan incident\nMichael Fagan (born 8 August 1948) is an intruder who broke into Buckingham Palace and entered Queen Elizabeth II's bedroom in 1982.  The incident was one of the 20th century's worst royal security breaches. \n\nBiography\n\nBeginnings\n\nMichael Fagan was born in Clerkenwell, London, on 8 August 1948, the son of Ivy and Michael Fagan, who was a steel erector and a \"champion safe-breaker\". He had two younger sisters, Margaret and Elizabeth. In 1955, he attended Compton Street School in Clerkenwell (now St. Peter & St. Paul RC Primary School). In 1966, he left home at 16 to escape his father, who, Fagan says, was violent, and started working as a painter and decorator. In 1972, he married Christine, with whom he had four children. \n\nBreak-ins\n\nFirst entry\n\nAccording to his own account, the 9 July 1982 incident was Michael Fagan's second attempted intrusion on the palace; the first happening about a month before.   Fagan says he shimmied up the drainpipe, startling a housemaid, who called security. When guards reached the scene, Fagan had disappeared, leading them to believe the housemaid was mistaken. Fagan claims he entered the palace through an unlocked window on the roof and spent the next half-hour eating cheddar cheese and crackers and wandering around. He tripped several alarms, but they were faulty. He claims to have viewed royal portraits and rested for a while on the throne. He also speaks of entering the postroom, where Diana, Princess of Wales had hidden presents for her first son, William. Fagan said he drank half a bottle of white wine before becoming tired and leaving.\n\nSecond entry\n\nAt the time of the second incident, 9 July 1982, Michael Fagan was 33 years old and an unemployed decorator whose wife had just left him. At around 7:00am on that morning Fagan scaled Buckingham Palace's 14 ft perimeter wall \u2013 topped with revolving spikes and barbed wire \u2013 and shimmied up a drainpipe before wandering into the Queen's bedroom at about 7:15am.\n\nAn alarm sensor had detected his prior movements inside the palace but police thought the alarm was faulty and silenced it. Fagan wandered the palace corridors for several minutes before reaching the section where the royal apartments were located. In an anteroom Fagan broke a glass ashtray, cutting his hand. He was still carrying a fragment of the glass when he entered the Queen's bedroom.\n\nThe Queen woke when he disturbed a curtain, and initial reports said Fagan sat on the edge of her bed. But in a 2012 interview, he said she left the room immediately to seek security. She had phoned the palace switchboard twice for police but none had arrived. Fagan then asked for some cigarettes, which were brought by a maid, who had been cleaning a neighbouring room. The duty footman, Paul Whybrew, who had been walking the Queen's dogs, then appeared, followed by two policemen on palace duty who removed Fagan. The incident had happened as the armed police officer outside the royal bedroom came off duty before his replacement arrived.\n\nA subsequent police report was critical of the competence of officers on duty as well as a system of confused and divided command.\n\nArrest\n\nSince it was then a civil wrong rather than a criminal offence, Fagan was not charged for trespassing in the Queen's bedroom.  He was charged with theft (of the wine), but the charges were dropped when he was committed for psychiatric evaluation. He spent the next six months in a psychiatric hospital before being released on 21 January 1983. It was not until 2007, when Buckingham Palace became a \"designated site\" for the purposes of section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, that what he did became criminal.  Fagan's mother later said, \"He thinks so much of the Queen. I can imagine him just wanting to simply talk and say hello and discuss his problems.\" \n\nLater life\n\nIn 1984, Fagan attacked a policeman at a caf\u00e9 in Fishguard, Wales, and was given a three-month suspended jail sentence. He was found guilty of indecent exposure in 1987 after he was spotted running around wearing no trousers on waste ground in Chingford, London. In 1997, he was imprisoned for four years after he, his wife and their 20-year-old son were charged with conspiring to supply heroin. \n\nNotoriety\n\nIn 1983, Michael Fagan recorded a cover version of the Sex Pistols song \"God Save The Queen\"  with British punk band the Bollock Brothers. He made an appearance in Channel 4's The Antics Roadshow,  an hour-long 2011 TV documentary directed by the British street artist Banksy charting the history of people behaving oddly in public. The palace intrusion was adapted in 2012 for an episode of Sky Arts' Playhouse Presents series entitled Walking the Dogs,   a one-off British comedy drama starring Emma Thompson as the monarch.\nQuestion:\nWho did Michael Fagan famously wake up in London in July 1982?\nAnswer:\nThe Queen (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nSRA-211-9-Psychological_Reasons_for_Terr.ppt - Security ...\nSRA-211-9-Psychological_Reasons_for_Terr.ppt - Security And Risk Analysis 211 with Barnes at Pennsylvania State University - All Campuses - StudyBlue\nFile Size: 18 Views: 3\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nPsychological Reasons for Terrorism SRA-21l, Threat of Terrorism and Crime Penn State Altoona David Barnes Stockholm Syndrome Psychological response found in some victims Hostages become dependent on their captors, and come to identify, sympathize and support their captors Named for a 1973 botched bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, in which the hostages emerged from the situation very supportive of their captors Can Psychology Help with Terrorism? Expressive view Terrorists are motivated largely by psychological reasons.  They react without much thought Instrumental view Acts of terrorism are deliberate, rational and guided by a calculated plan Expressive View Terrorism is a result of psychological issues Terrorists rationalize acts that they were psychologically compelled to commit anyway Terrorists are polarized.   They are righteous freedom fighters; we are evil Terrorists Are Not Abnormal? Studies of the IRA found no evidence of psychological abnormalities Terrorists who actually enjoy killing and violence tend to be unimportant figures within terrorist organizations and are followers rather than leaders     Comparative studies of different terrorist groups do not show a particular psychological type or uniform terrorist mind Splitting/Externalization A borderline personality disorder in which the individual ascribes all that is good to himself and projects or externalizes all that is bad to others     Splitting seems to be represented disproportionally among terrorists Family Background Come from broken homes Lost a father prior to age 14 Severe conflicts with their parents Convicted in juvenile courts A pattern of life long failure Other Psychological Factors Often not actually members of the societies they purport to commit their acts for     Seldom a well though out program, usually an expressive outburst  Chosen trauma-violent political behavior is the result of some selected historical experience that triggers a disproportionally violent reaction Temptation versus Intimidation Psychiatric Typology of Terrorism Crusaders commit terrorist acts to please God or the people they represent.  They will not negotiate Criminals commit terrorism for personal gain.  They are rational and will negotiate   Crazies commit terrorist acts because they are mad.  Note that crazy does not mean stupid Instrumental View Opposite of the expressive view Terrorism is a logical strategy based upon rational cost-benefit analysis  Terrorists are usually normal people pursing a rational, deliberate strategy Instrumental View of Psychology Psychological aspects of terrorist's behavior are important when analyzing the group's influence on individual behavior, but emphasizing psychological aspects is not helpful because there are too many reasons why people become terrorists Instead, consider the reasons for terrorism Situations in places where terrorism exists Reasons for terrorism Role of the individual terrorists Situation-Preconditions Enabling causes of terrorism Poverty Society prone to violence Technology such as bombs Urbanization-densely populated areas make attacks easier and more effective Social habits and historical conditions such as Pakistan Precipitants Reasons for terrorism, or what provides motivation and direction of terrorists If the police or army attacked a family member, that might motivate terrorists Black Friday in Iran in which the Shah's troops started shooting at people is widely considered to be a classical precipitant Seven Terrorist Motives Publicize the cause Disrupt establishment's normal function Create public sympathy Provoke a harsh response from the government Add cohesion, boost morale of the group Counter the government's greater military power Capitalize on unique historical opportunities Role of the Individual Instrumental view doesn't focus on psychological issues, but it also doesn't ignore them Things can be learned from individual terrorist's psychological makeup Common psychological characteristics are studied Attributes Common to Terrorists High tolerance to risk Heavy reliance on the group Vengeance for jailed or killed comrades Sense of guilt used to justify their actions Dedication to a political belief or cause More Common Attributes Willingness to self sacrifice Suppress normal emotions Reasonably high intelligence Education Access to resources\nWords From Our Students\n\"StudyBlue is great for studying.

Between 1861 and 1913, however, all but two presidents wore either beards or mustaches during their tenure in office. \n\nJohn Quincy Adams (1825\u201329) was the first U.S. President to have notable facial hair, with long sideburns.   But the first major departure from the tradition of smooth-faced chief executives was Abraham Lincoln (1861\u201365),    who was supposedly (and famously) influenced by 11-year-old Grace Bedell to start growing a beard shortly before he was elected.    After Lincoln, all but two presidents over the next 50 years sported facial hair, the exceptions being Andrew Johnson (1865\u201369) and William McKinley (1897\u20131901).   \n\nThe most recent president to have facial hair was William Howard Taft (1909\u20131913), who wore a mustache.       The last major party candidate to wear a beard was Charles Evans Hughes, who was defeated in 1916.   The last major party candidate for President to have facial hair was Thomas E. Dewey, who had a mustache, in 1944 and 1948.    Some pundits even claimed that public disapproval of Dewey's mustache may have contributed to his two electoral defeats.    \n\nSocial scientists have researched the effect of facial hair on the electability of Presidential candidates, and currently consider facial hair to have a negative effect on candidates.    Today, the existence of facial hair on potential presidential candidates is regularly noted (albeit somewhat jokingly) as a harmful factor.  \n\nFollowing is a list of American presidents who had facial hair at any time during their tenure. \n__TOC__\n\nList\nQuestion:\nWho was the first American president to have a beard\nAnswer:\nAbaraham lincoln\nPassage:\nSchick test\nThe Schick test, invented between 1910 and 1911  is a test used to determine whether or not a person is susceptible to diphtheria.   It was named after its inventor, B\u00e9la Schick (1877\u20131967), a Hungarian-born American pediatrician.\n\nThe test is a simple procedure.  A small amount (0.1 ml) of diluted (1/50 MLD) diphtheria toxin is injected intradermally into one arm of the person and a heat inactivated toxin on the other as a control.  If a person does not have enough antibodies to fight it off, the skin around the injection will become red and swollen, indicating a positive result.  This swelling disappears after a few days.  If the person has an immunity, then little or no swelling and redness will occur, indicating a negative result.\n\nResults can be interpreted as: \n# Positive: when the test results in a wheal of 5\u201310\u00a0mm diameter, reaching its peak in 4\u20137 days. The control arm shows no reaction. This indicates that the subject lacks antibodies against the toxin and hence is susceptible to the disease.\n# Pseudo-positive: when there is only a red colored inflammation (erythema)and it disappears within 4 days. This happens on both the arms since the subject is immune but hypersensitive to the toxin.\n# Negative reaction: Indicates that the person is immune\n# Combined reaction: Initial picture is like that of the pseudo-reaction but the erythema fades off after 4 days only in the control arm. It progresses on the test arm to a typical positive. The subject is interpreted to be both susceptible and hypersensitive.\n\nThe test was created when immunizing agents were scarce and not very safe, however as newer and safer toxoids were made available there was no more requirement for susceptibility tests.\nQuestion:\nA Schick test is a skin test for previously acquired immunity to which disease?\nAnswer:\nStrangling Angel\nPassage:\nPorridge (TV Series 1974\u20131977) - IMDb\nPorridge (TV Series 1974\u20131977) - IMDb\nIMDb\nThere was an error trying to load your rating for this title.\nSome parts of this page won't work property.

For instance, American football, association football, baseball, basketball, professional boxing, cricket, field hockey, Formula One, ice hockey, rugby football, team handball, tennis and volleyball are spectator sports, while hunting or underwater hockey typically are not. Spectator sports may be professional sports or amateur sports. They often are distinguished from participant sports, which are more recreational; golf and tennis can be either. Association football, also known as soccer, is by far the most watched sport on the planet.\n\nThe increasing broadcasting of sports events, along with media reporting can affect the number of people attending sports due to the ability to experience the sport without the need to physically attend and sometimes an increasingly enhanced experience including highlights, replays, commentary, statistics and analysis. Some sports are particularly known as \"armchair sports\" or \"lounge room sports\" due to the quality of the broadcasting experience in comparison to the live experience.\n\nSpectator sports have built their own set of culture and traditions including, in the United States, cheerleading and pre-game and half time entertainment such as fireworks, particularly for big games such as competition decider events and international tests. The passion of some sports fans also means that there are occasionally spectator incidents.\n\nNotable spectator sports events where events regularly sell out well in advance and are broadcast to large audiences include the FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, UEFA European Football Championship, Cricket World Cup, Commonwealth Games, The Ashes, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, Heineken Cup, Indian Premier League, Six Nations Championship, FA Cup, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Fu\u00dfball-Bundesliga, Australian Football League, Super League, Rugby League Challenge Cup, Grand Slam tennis, World Series Baseball, Rugby World Cup, Kentucky Derby, Melbourne Cup, PGA Tour, National Rugby League, All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, Wimbledon, Formula One, and NASCAR.\n\nThe North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM) devotes much of their annual conference to research addressing the psychology behind a desire to view spectator sports, and how it might be leveraged to increase demand. Much of the research focuses on exploiting a need for vicarious achievement, and a desire within the spectator to project a public image through a declaration of team allegiance.\n\nSeparation of the active and the passive, the line between sport and spectator, gives rise to the paradox of the spectator\u2014described by French philosopher Jacques Ranci\u00e8re; which is to seek an opportunity to passively contemplate engaging in an activity, and in doing so, forfeit that life moment one might have used to actually engage in the activity.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the most popular spectator sport in India?\nAnswer:\nCricket games\nPassage:\nThe | Define The at Dictionary.com\nThe | Define The at Dictionary.com\ndefinite article\n1.\n(used, especially before a noun, with a specifying or particularizing effect, as opposed to the indefinite or generalizing force of the indefinite article a or an):\nthe book you gave me; Come into the house.\n2.\n(used to mark a proper noun, natural phenomenon, ship, building, time, point of the compass, branch of endeavor, or field of study as something well-known or unique):\nthe sun; the Alps; the Queen Elizabeth; the past; the West.\n3.\n(used with or as part of a title):\nthe Duke of Wellington; the Reverend John Smith.\n4.\n(used to mark a noun as indicating the best-known, most approved, most important, most satisfying, etc.):\nthe skiing center of the U.S.; If you're going to work hard, now is the time.\n5.\n(used to mark a noun as being used generically):\nThe dog is a quadruped.\n6.\n(used in place of a possessive pronoun, to note a part of the body or a personal belonging):\nHe won't be able to play football until the leg mends.\n7.\n(used before adjectives that are used substantively, to note an individual, a class or number of individuals, or an abstract idea):\nto visit the sick; from the sublime to the ridiculous.\n8.\n(used before a modifying adjective to specify or limit its modifying effect):\nHe took the wrong road and drove miles out of his way.\n9.\n(used to indicate one particular decade of a lifetime or of a century):\nthe sixties; the Gay Nineties.\n10.\n(one of many of a class or type, as of a manufactured item, as opposed to an individual one):\nDid you listen to the radio last night?\n11.\nenough:\nHe saved until he had the money for a new car.

It starred Richard Burton as Leon Trotsky, as well as Romy Schneider and Alain Delon. A few years after release, The Assassination of Trotsky was included as one of the choices in the book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. \n\nPlot\n\nExiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, Leon Trotsky travels from Turkey to France to Norway, before arriving in Mexico in January 1937. The film begins in Mexico City in 1940, during a May Day celebration. Trotsky has not escaped the attention of the Soviet ruler of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, who sends out an assassin named Frank Jacson. The killer decides to infiltrate Trotsky's house by befriending one of the young communists in Trotsky's circle.\n\nCast\n\n* Richard Burton : Leon Trotsky\n* Alain Delon : Frank Jacson\n* Romy Schneider : Gita Samuels\n* Valentina Cortese : Natalia Sedowa Trotsky\n* Luigi Vannucchi : Ruiz\n* Jean Desailly : Alfred Rosmer\n* Simone Val\u00e8re : Marguerite Rosmer\n* Duilio Del Prete : Felipe\n* Jack Betts :  Lou (as Hunt Powers)\n* Michael Forest : Jim\n* Claudio Brook : Roberto\n* Joshua Sinclair : Sam\n* Giorgio Albertazzi : Commissioner\nProduction\n\nIn 1965 Josef Shaftel optioned the novel The Great Prince Died by Bernard Wolfe. The film was a co-production between the French Valoria Company and Dino De Laurentiis. It was to be shot in England  but was eventually filmed in Mexico. The movie used the Isaac Don Levine's book, The Mind of an Assassin as a source.\nQuestion:\nWhich British actor played the role of Leon Trotsky in the 1972 film \u2018The Assassination of Trotsky\u2019?\nAnswer:\nRichard Burton\nPassage:\nChina's Game Console Ban Lifted: How Will PS4, Xbox One ...\nChina's Game Console Ban Lifted: How Will PS4, Xbox One Make Money with So Much Piracy in the Country? : US News : Latin Post\nShare This Tweet This\nThis week China's government has lifted a 14-year old ban on devices. These devices included game consoles like our popular Xboxes , PlayStations and Wii devices. You see, in China, the government believed that these video games created a \"negative effect on the mental health of its youth .\"\u00a0Guess they changed their minds because as of now, China welcomes the popular game consoles Americans know so well.\nJust because the Chinese government had such a ban on our generation did not mean that the consoles and games were not being sold illegally or \"bootlegged.\" \u00a0This is where Microsoft, SONY and Nintendo will find a problem in sales. Yes, the ban is off, but kids are probably going to continue buying games for $1.65 from their usual bootlegger, instead of the $60 an average game goes for.\nZhang Yang has sold Xboxes, Wiis and PlayStations at his Beijing shop for as long as the devices have been available. \"The consoles that Zhang sells are smuggled into China, modified or 'cracked' to play pirated games,\" which has kept his shop up and running. Another problem that games corporation face are that Chinese gamers have became accustomed to playing free games on their PCs and mobiles through out the years. You cannot miss something you have never had.\nAdvertisement\n\"Console vendors will need to incorporate a business model for a piracy-rich environment,\" said Lisa Hanson, a \u00a0U.S. based Managing Director at Niko Partners , a research firm focused on Asian games market. \"They need to understand who the gamers are, what they demand, what are they not getting out of the current PC game experience that they could from a console game,\" Hanson added.\nSo while it is easy to sell Call of Duty to kids anywhere else in the world, a very carefully thought out marketing plan must teach Chinese kids how to appreciate the game. Something to also think about is how to convince parents in China to purchase the consoles and games for their \"positive shield minded\" kids. Have you seen that episode of South Park where Cartman organizes an entire Black Friday troop filled with betrayal and lies in order to get their hands on a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One? (Hilarious, by the way).\u00a0 Yeah... That's how obsessed gamers can really get.\nGood luck to game consoles in their new journey into success in the strict Chinese Market.\nQuestion:\nA fourteen year ban (for mental health reasons) on

Photograph: Julian Andrews/ Rex Features\nFriday 19 April 2013 12.59\u00a0EDT\nFirst published on Friday 19 April 2013 12.59\u00a0EDT\nShare on Messenger\nClose\nWere post-Olympics Britain to vote for a head girl, it would be a fair bet that the honour would fall to Clare Balding . If it's not shocking to learn from the\u00a0first volume of her endearing autobiography that she has form as a boarding school prefect, there are also little surprises embedded in the sports broadcaster's account of her early life. The daughter of a racehorse trainer, she measures out her life in ponies, boxers and lurchers, but even those who find the sporting life a distasteful mulch of dog slaver, moult and mucking out will find it hard to resist stories of the young Balding bowling into her house in filthy jodhpurs to find\u00a0the Queen eating breakfast, or the\u00a0Mean Girls atmosphere of boarding school pranks. Balding's love of animals is warmly expressed, a striking contrast to her rancour-free insights into a certain kind of English family, one who considered a brisk wave to be a public display of affection and who might easily forget to pick up their daughter for her first school holiday. As this biography underlines, however, she has turned out rather well.\nQuestion:\nMy Animals and Other Family is a 2013 autobiography by which TV and Radio presenter?\nAnswer:\nClare Balding\nPassage:\nSafety pin\nThe safety pin is a variation of the regular pin which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp.  The clasp serves two purposes: to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point.\n\nSafety pins are commonly used to fasten pieces of fabric or clothing together. Safety pins, or more usually a special version with an extra safe cover, called a nappy pin are widely used to fasten cloth diapers (nappies), as the safety clasp prevents the baby from being jabbed. Similarly, they can be used to patch torn or damaged clothing. Safety pins can also be used as an accessory in jewelry, like earrings, chains, and wristbands. Sometimes they are used to attach an embroidered patch. Size 3 is often used in  quilting and may be labelled for purchase as a \"quilting pin\". Size 4 and larger may be called \"blanket pins\" and deemed acceptable as  kilt pins for informal dress, depending upon design and appearance.\n\nEarly precursor\n\nThe fibula, a form of brooch, was invented by the Myceaneans on the Greek Peloponnesus between the 14th and 13th Century BC, and is considered an early precursor to a safety pin since they were used in a similar manner. However, it had a major flaw. It had no clasp or spring at the end to help put it in place. Over the centuries, the fibula became forgotten. \n\nInvention of the safety pin\n\nAmerican mechanic Walter Hunt is regarded as the inventor of the safety pin that bears resemblance to those used today. The safety pin included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place.   Charles Rowley (Birmingham, England) independently patented a similar safety pin in October 1849,  although the company no longer makes these.\n\nNeeding to settle a $15 debt with a friend, Hunt one day decided to invent something new in order to pay off his friend. He used a piece of brass wire that was about 8 inches long and made a coil in the center of the wire so it would open up when released. The clasp at one end was devised in order to shield the sharp edge from the user. \n\nAfter being issued U.S. patent #6,281 on April 10, 1849,  Hunt sold the patent to W. R. Grace and Company  for $400 (roughly $10,000 in 2008 dollars). Using that money, Hunt then paid the $15 owed to a friend and kept the remaining amount of $385 for himself. What Hunt failed to realize is that in the years to follow, W.R. Grace and Company would make millions of dollars in profits from his invention. \n\nLocking safety pin \n \nThis  has a special sliding cap over the top of the clasp to hold the pin more securely in place.\n\nNappy pin \n \nWhilst the cover on the safety pin makes it less likely to hurt someone, a version was invented specially for use with babies' nappies, the nappy pin.  This is larger and stronger than the typical safety pin. Modern nappy pins have the sliding cap to lock the pin.\n\nMedical aspects\n\nThe laryngologist Dr. Chevalier Jackson devised special instruments for removing swallowed safety pins. Because small children often swallowed them and open pins could be lodged dangerously in their throats, Jackson called them \"danger pins\" and sometimes displayed arrangements of those he had extracted. Safety pin ingestion is still a common problem in some countries, including Turkey, today. \n\nCulture\n\nDuring the emergence of punk rock in the late seventies, safety pins became associated with the genre, its followers and fashion.  Some claim the look was taken originally from Richard Hell whom the British punks saw in pictures, and whose style they adopted.  This is disputed by a number of artists from the first wave of British punks, most notably Johnny Rotten, who insists that safety pins were originally incorporated for more practical reasons, for example, to remedy \"the arse of your pants falling out\". British punk fans, after seeing the clothing worn by such punk forerunners, then incorporated safety pins into their own wardrobe as clothing decoration or as piercings, shifting the purpose of the pins from practicality to fashion. The safety pin subsequently has become an image associated with punk rock by media and pop-culture outlets.\nQuestion:\nWho invented the safety pin?\nAnswer:\nWALTER HUNT\nPassage:\nDiagram of the Human Body Using Etymologies - The ...\nDiagram of the Human Body Using Etymologies - The Examining Room of Dr. Charles\nThe Examining Room of Dr. Charles\nDiagram of the Human Body Using Etymologies\nJuly 11, 2013\nThe origin of a word is fascinating, and the etymology of a word\u2019s evolution tells a story. \u00a0You can almost picture syllables and letters marching like armies through distant lands \u2013 Old England, Low Germany, Ancient Greece\u2026 or rising up from a dark, primordial world of shapeless magic to take form and structure.\nI\u2019ve changed the anatomic names of the human body on this diagram to tell the story of each organ\u2019s epithet.

Over much of its range, it is resident year-round, but birds from the colder parts of the northern hemisphere typically migrate south (some well into the southern hemisphere) for the northern winter.\n\nDescription\n\nThe common buzzard measures between 40 and in length with a 109 - wingspan and a body mass of 427 -, making it a medium-sized raptor.\n\nThis broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus) and the only distantly related European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), which mimics the common buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from northern goshawks. The plumage can vary in Britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.\n\nSystematics\n\nThe common buzzard was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Falco buteo. Buteo is the Latin name for this species.81\n\nBuzzard subspecies fall into two groups.\nThe western Buteo group is mainly resident or short-distance migrants. They are:\n* Buteo buteo buteo: most of Europe\n* B. b. rothschildi: Azores\n* B. b. insularum: Canary Islands\n* B. b. pojana: Corsica and Sardinia\n* B. b. menetriesi: Caucasus\n* B. b. harterti: Madeira, doubtfully distinct from nominate buteo\n\nThe eastern vulpinus group includes\n* B. b. vulpinus (steppe buzzard): Eurasia: migrant breeder\n\nBehaviour\n\nThe common buzzard breeds in woodlands, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. It eats mainly small mammals, and will come to carrion. A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.\n\nBuzzards do not normally form flocks, but several may be seen together on migration or in good habitat. The Victorian writer on Dartmoor, William Crossing, noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places. Though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately 30 m apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. Pairs mate for life. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. This spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. He will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. He then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise.\n\nThe call is a plaintive peea-ay, similar to a cat's meow.\n\nStatus\n\nIn parts of its range it is increasing in numbers. In Ireland it became extinct about 1910, but began to slowly recolonise the country in the 1950s, and is now a common and familiar sight over much of Ireland.\n\nSteppe buzzard\n\nThe steppe buzzard, B. (b.) vulpinus breeds from east Europe eastward to the Far East, excluding Japan. It is a long-distance migrant, excepting some north Himalayan birds, and winters in Africa, India and southeastern Asia. In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.\n\nThe steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, B. vulpinus. Compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller (45 \u2013 long), longer winged and longer tailed. There are two colour morphs: the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (vulpes is Latin for \"fox\"), and a dark grey form.\n\nThe tail of vulpinus is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American red-tailed hawk. The upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. Adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in B. b. buteo.\nGallery\n\nButeo buteo -Hamerton Zoo, Cambridgeshire, England -head-8a.jpg|At Hamerton Zoo, England\nBuzzard UK09.JPG|In flight, Devon, England.

The matriarch of the Munster household, Lily is a vampire. The role was later played by Lee Meriwether in The Munsters Today and by Portia de Rossi in Mockingbird Lane.\n\nIn the original unaired color pilot her name was Phoebe Munster.\n\nOrigins\n\nLily was born in 1827 to Sam Dracula (Grandpa) and his 166th wife (referred to only as \"Grandma\"). She lived with Grandpa for some time in Transylvania (a region in Romania) before meeting Herman Munster and marrying him in 1865. She, Grandpa, and Herman moved to America sometime before the mid-1940s and adopted her sister's child, Marilyn. In the mid-1950s, she gave birth to Eddie, her and Herman's only child.\n\nHer name is presumably derived from the tradition of the lily as a flower of death, or a vague reference to Lilith, a female demon of Jewish mythology.\n\nDescription\n\nLily is the matriarch of the Munster family. She is very close with her niece, Marilyn. She has a werewolf for a brother, who appears in one episode, and a sister who is mentioned a few times who is Marilyn's mother. Lily is the voice of reason in the Munster household, often relied upon to set problems right, and typically mediates when Herman and Grandpa squabble.\n\nLily also has a fiery temper. While she is deeply in love with Herman (\"Pussycat,\" as she calls him), she also frequently gets very angry at him (due to his frequent stupidity and occasional selfishness), and Herman often meekly discloses his fear (to others) of being on the receiving end of her wrath. She also has reprimanded her own father (Grandpa) on several occasions for his own foolish actions and stubborn self-righteousness.\n\nLily treats her niece Marilyn as her own daughter, but shares the family's concern that Marilyn's \"hideousness\" is going to condemn her to a spinster's life. As such, she is very much in favor of Marilyn dating, and is very accommodating to Marilyn's fleeting beaus despite their \"rudeness.\" (What Lily is perceiving as lack of manners is in fact the young man's terror of seeing Marilyn's monstrous relatives).\n\nLily is very supportive of her son, Eddie, and keeps a close eye on his activities and social circle.\n\nLily is mainly a housewife, and her duties include spreading garbage around the mansion and \"dusting\" with a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse so that it blows dirt about in the nine-room-and-a-dungeon house. During the course of the series, Lily works as a welder in a shipyard, a fashion model, and a palm reader in a tea room. In one episode she forces Herman to give her money so that she and Marilyn can open a beauty parlor, but this soon goes out of business, as Lily assumes her clientele wants to look more like her. These part-time jobs never seem to stick, and Lily would be back to being a homemaker by the next episode.\n\nLily is a beautiful and slender woman who appears to be in her middle age years, although she is actually hundreds of years old.  Later incarnations of the character, played by different actresses, would change her skin from green to pale white. A white streak in her hair recalls the monster's mate from Bride of Frankenstein. Lily usually dresses in an ankle-length pale pink gown that appears faded and old, and she sometimes also wears a scarf. Her necklace features a bat-shaped medallion. When away from the Munster house, she sometimes wears a long silver cape with a hood. In the episode \"Munsters Masquerade\", Lily demonstrates the ability to float in the air while dancing.\n\nTrue to her vampire nature, when Lily sleeps she resembles a corpse: ramrod straight and fingers cradled on her chest, even holding a lily (flower) between her fingers. However, like her father, she casts a reflection, sleeps at night and has no problems going out in the daylight (although she wears her heavy cape and hood), despite the two being vampires. She also never is shown to be craving blood or attempting to bite a mortal, like Grandpa occasionally does.\n\nDevelopment\n\nLily was not in the original pilot episode of The Munsters. Instead, Herman is married to a much more Gothic-looking wife named Phoebe, played by Joan Marshall. The producers scrapped the Phoebe character after deciding she seemed almost an exact double of the Morticia Addams character on The Addams Family. Lily appeared in the second pilot and all other episodes. In the pilot, the Phoebe character was depicted as more goth in nature, and also has a somewhat abrasive bickering relationship with Herman and a strained relationship with Eddie, both elements toned down with Lily.\n\nYvonne De Carlo was cast for the role in March 1964. When first cast, Gwynne and Lewis went to the producers and complained because De Carlo was a movie star of long standing and they were worried that she would not fit in. However, after a few shows, they had to admit they had been wrong, and all got on well.\n\nNotes\n\n* Note A:  Her age at the beginning of Season 1. This does not take into account the fact that she is undead, and thus has some unknown date of death.\nQuestion:\nWhat was Lily Munster's maiden name?\nAnswer:\nKretzulesco\nPassage:\nWhen You Walk in the Room\n\"When You Walk in the Room\" is a song written and recorded by Jackie DeShannon, first released by her in 1963 but covered by many artists. The lyrics of the song attempt to detail the singer's emotions when in the presence of the person he or she loves. There is also an expression of frustration by the singer that he or she cannot manage to tell that person of his or her love.\n\nJackie DeShannon version\n\nDeShannon's original version was released as a single on November 23, 1963.  as the B-Side to \"Till You Say You'll Be Mine\". It was later rereleased as a single A-side in September 1964, and later included on the album Breakin' It Up on the Beatles Tour. The single charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, peaking at #99. \n\nThe Searchers version\n\nThe song was recorded by The Searchers in 1964. This version became an international hit, reaching #35 in the US and #5 in the UK.\n\nAnother early hit for Jackie DeShannon, \"Needles and Pins\", written by Jack Nitzche and a little known at the time songwriter from Detroit by the name of Sonny Bono, was covered by the Searchers also.\n\nThe Searchers' version of the song would be covered by The Young Veins.\n\nStephanie Winslow version\n\nStephanie Winslow, is an American country music artist. Her version reached #29 on the U.S. country singles charts.\n\nChart positions\n\nPaul Carrack version\n\nPaul Carrack's version, from his 1987 album One Good Reason, reached number 90 in the U.S.  and number 48 in the UK. \n\nPam Tillis version\n\nIn 1994, country music artist Pam Tillis recorded a version for her 1994 album Sweetheart's Dance.

Open iTunes to buy and download music.\nBiography\nOne of the linchpins of the British rock & roll revival of the 1970s and '80s, Shakin' Stevens ranks among the most persistent performers ever to emerge, ultimately, as a superstar. Stevens has no less than 30 U.K. Top 40 hits to his name, almost all of them racked up during a five-year span of chart invincibility. Yet his recording career pre-dated his first hit by over a decade, struggling through a period that might have forced any less committed artist to simply abandon all hope.  \"Shaky\" was born Michael Barratt on March 4, 1948 in Ely, Wales. The youngest of 11 children and a keen amateur singer, he was already married and working as a milkman when he formed Shakin' Stevens & the Sunsets, his first professional band, in 1968. The bandmembers themselves had been playing together in one form or another since the late '50s (when they formed as the Backbeats), and knew Stevens as one of their most devoted fans; he would often join them on-stage to perform a guest vocal or two. With a ferocious live following around South Wales, the band signed to Parlophone in 1970 and recorded its debut album, the optimistically titled A Legend, with producer Dave Edmunds. Reports that they also opened for the Rolling Stones in December 1969 appear to be exaggerated, but the band gigged regularly around Germany and Holland, and scored several European hit singles.  Still, they seemed doomed to haunt the rock & roll revival circuit, all the more so after Stevens was cast in impresario Jack Good's musical Elvis in 1977 (he appeared as the Army-era King), and the band was forced into hiatus for the duration of the play's six-month run. Worse was to come (for the group), however, as Elvis went on to become one of the year's biggest musicals. Stevens' run was extended to two years, and exploding media attention made it clear that Shaky would not be returning to South Wales anytime soon. Stevens quit the Sunsets in late 1979 and, as a solo performer, was signed briefly to Track Records. However, three singles and the Play Loud LP were lost when the label went bankrupt and, while Stevens quickly bounced back, signing to CBS in 1980. His first attempt at recording an album for the label ended with rejection.  A role in Jack Good's reborn Oh Boy TV series kept Stevens at the forefront, however, and the CBS subsidiary Epic picked him up. Three singles flopped, but in February 1980 Stevens finally scored his first U.K. hit when a version of Buck Owens' \"Hot Dog\" reached number 24. \"Marie Marie,\" a Top 20 hit, arrived that summer, and the following February, Stevens enjoyed his first U.K. chart-topper, \"This Ole House.\" The follow-up, \"You Drive Me Crazy,\" reached number two, before \"Green Door\" returned him to the top. Thereafter, the hits flew thick and fast; further chart-toppers \"Oh Julie\" (1982) and \"Merry Christmas Everyone\" (1985) sandwiched such smashes as \"Shirley,\" \"Give Me Your Heart Tonight,\" \"I'll Be Satisfied,\" \"Blue Christmas,\" \"Cry Just a Little Bit,\" and many more.   A 1985 reunion with the Sunsets' first producer, Dave Edmunds, resulted in the Lipstick Powder & Paint LP (Edmunds also handled the Christmas number one), while Stevens' other albums included the Top Three successes This Ole House and Shaky (both 1981) and Give Me Your Heart Tonight (1982). There was even chart action for his early-'70s work with the Sunsets, gathered up on the 1981 compilation Shakin' Stevens. Litigation relating to this material would pursue Stevens through the remainder of the   80s and into the '90s, as his former bandmates battled over unpaid royalties. The hits grew smaller as the '80s progressed; his final U.K. Top Five entry was a revival of \"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For\" in 1987; other singles struggled to even approach the peaks Shaky had once dominated, and in 1993, Stevens retired from recording and performing. His final hit, the previous year's \"Radio,\" was recorded with Queen's Roger Taylor and reached number 37.  Stevens remained in retirement for six years. He was back on the live circuit in 1999, and in 2005 he returned to the U.K. chart with the hits compilation The Collection. That same year he appeared on, and won, the U.K. pop oldies reality TV show Hit Me Baby One More Time -- his victorious song, a cover of P!nk's \"Trouble,\" brought him a Top 20 hit that summer, and paved the way for his first new album in 15 years, 2007's Now Listen. The following year saw Stevens celebrate his 60th birthday with a string of major concerts around the U.K. and Europe, including an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. Another celebratory tour followed in 2011 when Stevens launched his 30th anniversary celebration and released a new album, Rockin' the Blues. Returning in 2016 with his 20th studio album, Stevens took inspiration from his own ancestral background for the much darker and Americana-influenced Echoes of Our Times. ~ Dave Thompson\nTop Albums\nQuestion:\nUnder what name did Michael Barratt have four No.1 hits in the 1980's?\nAnswer:\nShakin Stevens\nPassage:\nLord of Mann\nThe title Lord of Mann () is used on the Isle of Man to refer to the island's Lord Proprietor   and head of state. The current holder of the title is Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nRelationship with the Crown\n\nThe title is not correctly used on its own. Since 1399, the Kings and Lords of Mann existed in a position of feudality as vassals of the reigning King of England, and subsequently of Great Britain and the United Kingdom, who was the ultimate sovereign of the island. This right of 'Lord Proprietor' was revested into the Crown by the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 and hence ceased to exist separately. King George III became the first British monarch to rule the Isle of Man as 'Lord of Mann' in 1765.  However, for reasons of culture and tradition, the title Lord of Mann continues to be used. For these reasons, the correct formal usage, as used on the Isle of Man for the Loyal Toast, is The Queen, Lord of Mann.\n\nThe title is now Lord of Mann regardless of gender. However, during her reign, Queen Victoria was styled as Lady of Mann. \n\nThe formal Latin style is .\n\nList of Lords\n\nPrior to 1504, the ruler of the Isle of Man was generally styled King of Mann. \n\n16th century\n\n*Thomas, Earl of Derby, 1504\u20131521\n*Edward, Earl of Derby, 1521\u20131572\n*Henry, Earl of Derby, 1572\u20131593\n*Ferdinando, Earl of Derby, 1593\u20131594\n\nSuccession dispute (1594\u20131607)\n\nIn 1598, a succession dispute between the daughters of Ferdinando and their uncle, William, Earl of Derby was heard. It was decided by the Privy Council that the right to the Isle of Man belonged solely to Queen Elizabeth I, and the letters-patent of 1405 which have conferred the Isle of Man to the Stanley family were declared null and void as the previous ruler, Henry, Earl of Northumberland, had not been subject to legal attainder, despite his treason, and the 1405 and 1406 letters-patent had therefore not taken effect.  \n\nThe Queen, in consideration of the \"many eminent services performed to herself and to her royal predecessors by the honourable and noble House of Stanley\", withdrew her right and referred the contending claimants to the decision of the Privy Council as to the best claim of inheritance.\n\nThe Law Lords on the Privy Council decided \"the grant being by letters patent under the Great Seal of England, such right would descend according to the Common Law of England to the heirs general, and not to the heirs male\", and the island was therefore awarded to Ferdinando's daughters; whereupon William agreed to purchase their several shares and interests. \n\nThe original letters-patent having been declared void, the Parliament of England in 1609 under James I passed a Private Act of Parliament entitled \"An Act for assuring and establishing the Isle of Man in the name and blood of William, Earl of Derby\" [(1609) 7 Jac.1 c.4]  which established the title in law as Lord of Mann. The lordship was conferred by letters-patent dated 7 July 1609 upon William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby.  Subsequent succession was under the terms of this grant. \n\nInterim Lords (1607\u20131609)\n\nFollowing the resolution of the succession dispute, it was ruled that the daughters of Ferdinando Stanley were the rightful heirs. As the oldest of them would not reach the age of majority until 1609, two temporary Lords of Mann were appointed by James I, using letters patent,  so that the daughters could benefit from the Island's revenues.\n*Henry, Earl of Northampton, 1607\u20131608\n*Robert, Earl of Salisbury, 1608\u20131609\n\nFollowing the coming of age of the heirs to the Lordship of the Isle of Man, the rights over the island were sold to their uncle, William Stanley. He took up the title of Lord of Mann following the passing of an Act of Parliament. \n\n17th century\n\n*William, Earl of Derby, 1609\u20131612\n*Elizabeth, Countess of Derby, 1612\u20131627\n*James, Earl of Derby, 1627\u20131651 (known as 'the Great Stanley')\n*Thomas, Lord Fairfax of Cameron, 1651\u20131660 (appointed by Oliver Cromwell during the English Interregnum)\n*Charles, Earl of Derby, 1660\u20131672 (restored by Charles II)\n*William, Earl of Derby, 1672\u20131702\n*James, Earl of Derby, 1702\u20131736\n*James, Duke of Atholl, 1736\u20131764\n*Charlotte, Duchess of Atholl and John, Duke of Atholl,  1764\u20131765\n\nRevestment\n\nIn 1765, Charlotte Murray, Duchess of Atholl, 8th Baroness Strange, sold the suzerainty of the island to the British government for \u00a370,000 and an annuity of \u00a32,000 (\u00a35,235,000 and \u00a3150,000 respectively in modern terms). By the passage of the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 the title of Lord of Mann was revested into the British Crown. It has therefore since been used on the Isle of Man to refer to the reigning Monarch of the United Kingdom.\n\nAll remaining rights and property of the Dukes of Atholl on the island were sold to the British government in 1828 for the sum of \u00a3417,144 (over \u00a320,000,000 in modern terms).  \nThis was accomplished by two Private Acts of Parliament:\n\n* \"An Act empowering the Lords of the Treasury to Purchase all the Manorial Rights of the Duke of Atholl in the Isle of Man\" [c. 34] 10 June 1824\n* \"An Act to empower the Commissioners of His Majesty\u2019s Treasury to purchase a certain Annuity in respect of Duties and Customs levied in the Isle of Man, and any reserved sovereign rights in the said Island belonging to John Duke of Atholl\" [c. 34] 10 June 1825\nQuestion:\nWho currently holds the title of Lord of Mann ?\nAnswer:\nQueen Elizabeth II of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\nPassage:\nSunday Bloody Sunday (film)\nSunday Bloody Sunday is a 1971 British drama film written by Penelope Gilliatt, directed by John Schlesinger and starring Murray Head, Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch. It tells the story of a free-spirited young bisexual artist (played by Head) and his simultaneous relationships with a female recruitment consultant (Jackson) and a male Jewish doctor (Finch).\n\nThe film is significant for its time in that Finch's homosexual character is depicted as successful and relatively well-adjusted, and not particularly upset by his sexuality. In this sense, Sunday Bloody Sunday was a considerable departure from Schlesinger's previous film Midnight Cowboy, which had portrayed its gay characters as alienated and self-loathing, as well as other gay-themed films of the era, including Boys in the Band, and Some of My Best Friends Are....\n\nThe film was released before the 1972 shooting by the British Army of unarmed protesters in Derry, Northern Ireland, an event dubbed \"Bloody Sunday.\"\n\nSynopsis\n\nSet in London, a middle-aged Jewish doctor, Daniel Hirsh (Peter Finch), and a young woman in her mid-30s, Alex Greville (Glenda Jackson) are both involved in a love triangle with contemporary sculptor Bob Elkin (Murray Head), a younger man in his mid-20s. Not only are Hirsh and Greville both aware that Elkin is seeing the other but they know one another through common friends. Despite this, they are willing to put up with the situation through fear of losing Elkin, who switches freely between them.\n\nFor Greville, the relationship is bound up with a growing disillusionment about her professional life, failed marriage and uneasy childhood. For Hirsh, it represents an escape from the repressed nature of his Jewish upbringing. Both realise the lack of permanence about their situation and it is only when Elkin decides to leave the country to settle in New York City after receiving an offer to open his own art gallery to display and sell his artwork, that they both come face to face (for the first time in the narrative at the end). Despite their opposed situations, both Hirsh and Greville come to realize that it is time to move on and Elkin leaves for the USA.\n\nCast\n\n* Peter Finch as Dr. Daniel Hirsh\n* Glenda Jackson as Alex Greville\n* Murray Head as Bob Elkin\n* Peggy Ashcroft as Mrs. Greville\n* Tony Britton as George Harding\n* Maurice Denham as Mr. Greville\n* Bessie Love as Answering Service Lady\n* Vivian Pickles as Alva Hodson\n* Frank Windsor as Bill Hodson\n* Thomas Baptiste as Professor Johns\n* Richard Pearson as Patient\n* June Brown as Woman Patient \n* Hannah Norbert as Daniel's Mother\n* Harold Goldblatt as Daniel's Father\n* Russell Lewis as Timothy Hodson\n* Marie Burke as Aunt Astrid\n* Caroline Blakiston as Rowing Wife \n* Peter Halliday as Rowing Husband \n* Jon Finch as Scotsman\n* Robert Rietti as Daniel's Brother\n* Douglas Lambert as Man at Party \n* Nike Arrighi as Party Guest\n* Edward Evans as Husband at Hospital \n* Gabrielle Daye as Wife at Hospital\n* Petra Markham (uncredited) as Designer's girlfriend \n* Daniel Day-Lewis (uncredited) as Child vandal\n* John Warner (uncredited) as Party Guest\n\nProduction notes\n\n* Alan Bates was the original choice made by John Schlesinger for the role of Daniel Hirsh, the gay doctor. However he was held up filming The Go-Between (1970) and was replaced first by Ian Bannen, who dropped out after two weeks' filming, and later by Peter Finch. However, the role of Daniel was written as that of a much younger man.\n* Several actresses (including Dame Edith Evans and Thora Hird) politely refused the part of Glenda Jackson's mother, Mrs. Greville, because they thought the project was too risqu\u00e9. Peggy Ashcroft accepted after the director explained to her the elements of the story and she gladly signed on.\n* Ian Bannen was fired from the role of Daniel Hirsh shortly after filming began. Apparently, he was so nervous about what kissing another actor on screen might do to his career, he could not concentrate enough to even get going with the part. He later said that losing the role set back his career, and regretted it till his death.\n* Actor Daniel Day-Lewis made his film debut at the age of 14 in this film as a vandal in an uncredited role. He described the experience as \"heaven\", for getting paid \u00a32 to vandalize expensive cars parked outside his local church.\n\nMusic\n\nThe film makes extensive use of source music including a recurring motif of the trio Soave sia il vento from Mozart's opera Cos\u00ec fan tutte.\n\nReception\n\nThe film currently holds a 91% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. \n\nThis film appeared on both Roger Ebert's and Gene Siskel's Top 10 list of 1971. Listed as No. 5 and No. 6 respectively. Roger Ebert commented, \"The official East Coast line on John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday was that it is civilized. That judgment was enlisted to carry the critical defense of the movie; and, indeed, how can the decent critic be against a civilized movie about civilized people? My notion, all the same, is that Sunday Bloody Sunday is about people who suffer from psychic amputation, not civility, and that this film is not an affirmation but a tragedy...I think 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' is a masterpiece, but I don't think it's about what everybody else seems to think it's about. This is not a movie about the loss of love, but about its absence.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nSunday Bloody Sunday was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Actor (Peter Finch), Best Actress (Glenda Jackson), Best Director (John Schlesinger), and Best Original Screenplay (Penelope Gilliatt). Gilliatt won several Best Screenplay awards for the film, including the New York Film Critics Circle Award, Writers Guild of America, and Writers' Guild of Great Britain.\n\nIt won the BAFTA Award for Best Film. It also won acting honors for Finch and Jackson, as well as Best Director for Schlesinger.\nQuestion:\n\"Now among the most praised and honoured people in the film industry, who made his screen acting debut in \"\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\"\" in 1971 ?\"\nAnswer:\nDaniel Day Lewis\nPassage:\nGunn & Moore\nGunn & Moore, commonly shortened to GM, is a sports equipment and apparel company founded in 1885 based in Colwick, Nottinghamshire, England that specialises in cricket. It became part of the UNICORN GROUP in 1968. \n\nOverview\n\nGunn & Moore was founded in 1885 by English Test batsman William Gunn and local businessman Thomas James Moore,  and is most recognised for manufacturing cricket bats. \n\nThe company was originally based at 49 Carrington Street in Nottingham. \n\nThe company also manufactures clothing and a full range of other cricket equipment. Many professional cricketers use its bats and have had endorsement deals with the company, including Quinton de Kock (South Africa), Shane Watson (Australia), England's former star spinner Graeme Swann, as well as former international captains Graeme Smith (South Africa), South Africa's high profile test opener, Steve Waugh (Australia), Stephen Fleming (New Zealand), Michael Vaughan (England) and Anil Kumble (India).\nGunn & Moore bats are almost exclusively made in England, distinguishing the company others which manufacture a large percentage of their bats outside of Great Britain. Gunn and Moore use a former Mauser rifle factory copying lathe, originally used to make the stocks for small arms, to rough out the blades; the machine was brought back from Germany after World War 1.\n\nBats\n\nThe range of bats  was:\n* Six6 F4.5 DXM \n* Purist F2 DXM \n* Icon DXM (Also in F2 + F4.5) \n* Argon DXM (Also in F2)\n* Octane F2 DXM \n* Zona F2 DXM\n* GMax DXM\n* Aura DXM\n* Sigma DXM\n* Mogul F4.5 DXM\n* Maestro DXM\n* Halo DXM\n* Apex DXM\n* Epic DXM\n* Luna DXM\n* Max-E DXM\n* Hero DXM\n* Paragon DXM\n* Mana DXM\n* Maxi DXM\n\nSponsorships\n\nThe following international players have current endorsement deals with Gunn & Moore. \n\nSri Lanka\n\n* Prasanna Jayawardene - Mogul\n\nSouth Africa\n\n* Neil McKenzie - Octane\n* Robin Peterson - Icon\n* Graeme Smith - Six6\n* Quinton de Kock - Paragon\n* Vernon Philander - Mogul\n* Kyle Abbott (cricketer) - Aura\n* Dwaine Pretorius - Icon\n* Gulam Bodi - Argon\n* Richard Levi - Mogul\n* Werner Coetsee - Icon\n* Stephen Cook (cricketer) - Mana\n* Dane Vilas - Mana\n* Justin Ontong - Icon\n* Farhaan Behardien - Six6\n* Gihahn Cloete - Octane\n* Darryn Smit - Icon\n* Jean Symes - Mana\n* Johan Van Der Wath - Icon\n* Rory Kleinveldt - Mogul\n\nEngland\n\n* Michael Lumb - Six6\n* Samit Patel - Aura\n* Graeme Swann - Icon\n* James Vince - Mogul\n* Matthew Fisher (cricketer) - Octane\n* Daniel Bell-Drummond - Aura\n* Sarah Taylor - Mogul\n* Andrew Gale - Aura\n* Adam Lyth - Octane\n* Kate Cross - Six6\n* Alex Lees (cricketer) - Six6\n* Ben Duckett - Aura\n* Jenny Gunn - Six6\n* Zafar Ansari - Icon\n* Lewis Gregory - Mogul\n* Chris Read - Six6\n* Tom Fell - Six6\n* Kishen Velani - Aura\n* Amy Jones - Mogul\n* Jimmy Adams - Six6\n* Chris Dent - Octane\n* Alex Davies - Sigma\n* Donald Aneurin - Aura\n* Matthew Boyce - Icon\n* Karl Brown - Sigma\n* Nathan Buck - Sigma\n* Rory Burns - Sigma\n* Jordan Clark - Sigma\n* Ian Cockbain (cricketer, born 1987) - Sigma\n* Ryan Davies - Octane\n* Tom Fell - Six6\n* Luke Fletcher - Icon\n* Alex Gidman - Octane\n* Fynn Hudson-Prentice - Aura\n* Ateeq Javid - Icon\n* Wayne Madsen - Octane\n* Lewis McManus - Aura\n* Stephen Parry - Sigma\n* Ravi Patel - Aura\n* Luis Reece - Sigma\n* Michael Richardson - Aura\n* Adam Riley - Icon\n* Andrew Salter - Sigma\n* Ben Slater - Icon\n* Cameron Steel - Six6\n* Jonny Tattersall - Six6\n* Bard Taylor - Aura\n* Freddie van den Bergh - Argon\n* Kishen Velani - Aura\n* Max Waller - Aura\n* Graham Clark - Icon\n\nScotland\n\n* Jean Symes - Flare\n* Gordon Goudie - Six6\n\nNetherlands\n\n* Ryan ten Doeschate - Icon\n\nAustralia\n\n* James Hopes - Mogul\n* Dominic Thornely - Flare\n* Chris Matthews (cricketer) - Aura\n* Liam Davis (cricketer) - Icon\n* Alex Doolan - Six6\n* Cameron Borgas - Icon\n* Jordan Silk - Mana\n* Travis Head - Mana\n* Matt Short - Six6\n\nNew Zealand\n\n* Nathan McCullum - Aura\n* Peto Tran - Mogul\n* Dean Brownlie - Icon\n* Ross Taylor - Six6\n* Rob Nicol - Argon\n* Peter Fulton - Icon\n* Corey Anderson - Paragon\nQuestion:\nWhat do the firms Redwood, Wormwood and Gunn and Moore aii make?\nAnswer:\nMongoose bat\nPassage:\nMichael Fagan incident\nMichael Fagan (born 8 August 1948) is an intruder who broke into Buckingham Palace and entered Queen Elizabeth II's bedroom in 1982.  The incident was one of the 20th century's worst royal security breaches. \n\nBiography\n\nBeginnings\n\nMichael Fagan was born in Clerkenwell, London, on 8 August 1948, the son of Ivy and Michael Fagan, who was a steel erector and a \"champion safe-breaker\". He had two younger sisters, Margaret and Elizabeth. In 1955, he attended Compton Street School in Clerkenwell (now St. Peter & St. Paul RC Primary School). In 1966, he left home at 16 to escape his father, who, Fagan says, was violent, and started working as a painter and decorator. In 1972, he married Christine, with whom he had four children. \n\nBreak-ins\n\nFirst entry\n\nAccording to his own account, the 9 July 1982 incident was Michael Fagan's second attempted intrusion on the palace; the first happening about a month before.   Fagan says he shimmied up the drainpipe, startling a housemaid, who called security. When guards reached the scene, Fagan had disappeared, leading them to believe the housemaid was mistaken. Fagan claims he entered the palace through an unlocked window on the roof and spent the next half-hour eating cheddar cheese and crackers and wandering around. He tripped several alarms, but they were faulty. He claims to have viewed royal portraits and rested for a while on the throne. He also speaks of entering the postroom, where Diana, Princess of Wales had hidden presents for her first son, William. Fagan said he drank half a bottle of white wine before becoming tired and leaving.\n\nSecond entry\n\nAt the time of the second incident, 9 July 1982, Michael Fagan was 33 years old and an unemployed decorator whose wife had just left him. At around 7:00am on that morning Fagan scaled Buckingham Palace's 14 ft perimeter wall \u2013 topped with revolving spikes and barbed wire \u2013 and shimmied up a drainpipe before wandering into the Queen's bedroom at about 7:15am.\n\nAn alarm sensor had detected his prior movements inside the palace but police thought the alarm was faulty and silenced it. Fagan wandered the palace corridors for several minutes before reaching the section where the royal apartments were located. In an anteroom Fagan broke a glass ashtray, cutting his hand. He was still carrying a fragment of the glass when he entered the Queen's bedroom.\n\nThe Queen woke when he disturbed a curtain, and initial reports said Fagan sat on the edge of her bed. But in a 2012 interview, he said she left the room immediately to seek security. She had phoned the palace switchboard twice for police but none had arrived. Fagan then asked for some cigarettes, which were brought by a maid, who had been cleaning a neighbouring room. The duty footman, Paul Whybrew, who had been walking the Queen's dogs, then appeared, followed by two policemen on palace duty who removed Fagan. The incident had happened as the armed police officer outside the royal bedroom came off duty before his replacement arrived.\n\nA subsequent police report was critical of the competence of officers on duty as well as a system of confused and divided command.\n\nArrest\n\nSince it was then a civil wrong rather than a criminal offence, Fagan was not charged for trespassing in the Queen's bedroom.  He was charged with theft (of the wine), but the charges were dropped when he was committed for psychiatric evaluation. He spent the next six months in a psychiatric hospital before being released on 21 January 1983. It was not until 2007, when Buckingham Palace became a \"designated site\" for the purposes of section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, that what he did became criminal.  Fagan's mother later said, \"He thinks so much of the Queen. I can imagine him just wanting to simply talk and say hello and discuss his problems.\" \n\nLater life\n\nIn 1984, Fagan attacked a policeman at a caf\u00e9 in Fishguard, Wales, and was given a three-month suspended jail sentence. He was found guilty of indecent exposure in 1987 after he was spotted running around wearing no trousers on waste ground in Chingford, London. In 1997, he was imprisoned for four years after he, his wife and their 20-year-old son were charged with conspiring to supply heroin. \n\nNotoriety\n\nIn 1983, Michael Fagan recorded a cover version of the Sex Pistols song \"God Save The Queen\"  with British punk band the Bollock Brothers. He made an appearance in Channel 4's The Antics Roadshow,  an hour-long 2011 TV documentary directed by the British street artist Banksy charting the history of people behaving oddly in public. The palace intrusion was adapted in 2012 for an episode of Sky Arts' Playhouse Presents series entitled Walking the Dogs,   a one-off British comedy drama starring Emma Thompson as the monarch.\nQuestion:\nWho did Michael Fagan famously wake up in London in July 1982?\nAnswer:\nThe Queen (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nSRA-211-9-Psychological_Reasons_for_Terr.ppt - Security ...\nSRA-211-9-Psychological_Reasons_for_Terr.ppt - Security And Risk Analysis 211 with Barnes at Pennsylvania State University - All Campuses - StudyBlue\nFile Size: 18 Views: 3\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nPsychological Reasons for Terrorism SRA-21l, Threat of Terrorism and Crime Penn State Altoona David Barnes Stockholm Syndrome Psychological response found in some victims Hostages become dependent on their captors, and come to identify, sympathize and support their captors Named for a 1973 botched bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, in which the hostages emerged from the situation very supportive of their captors Can Psychology Help with Terrorism? Expressive view Terrorists are motivated largely by psychological reasons.  They react without much thought Instrumental view Acts of terrorism are deliberate, rational and guided by a calculated plan Expressive View Terrorism is a result of psychological issues Terrorists rationalize acts that they were psychologically compelled to commit anyway Terrorists are polarized.   They are righteous freedom fighters; we are evil Terrorists Are Not Abnormal? Studies of the IRA found no evidence of psychological abnormalities Terrorists who actually enjoy killing and violence tend to be unimportant figures within terrorist organizations and are followers rather than leaders     Comparative studies of different terrorist groups do not show a particular psychological type or uniform terrorist mind Splitting/Externalization A borderline personality disorder in which the individual ascribes all that is good to himself and projects or externalizes all that is bad to others     Splitting seems to be represented disproportionally among terrorists Family Background Come from broken homes Lost a father prior to age 14 Severe conflicts with their parents Convicted in juvenile courts A pattern of life long failure Other Psychological Factors Often not actually members of the societies they purport to commit their acts for     Seldom a well though out program, usually an expressive outburst  Chosen trauma-violent political behavior is the result of some selected historical experience that triggers a disproportionally violent reaction Temptation versus Intimidation Psychiatric Typology of Terrorism Crusaders commit terrorist acts to please God or the people they represent.

Between 1861 and 1913, however, all but two presidents wore either beards or mustaches during their tenure in office. \n\nJohn Quincy Adams (1825\u201329) was the first U.S. President to have notable facial hair, with long sideburns.   But the first major departure from the tradition of smooth-faced chief executives was Abraham Lincoln (1861\u201365),    who was supposedly (and famously) influenced by 11-year-old Grace Bedell to start growing a beard shortly before he was elected.    After Lincoln, all but two presidents over the next 50 years sported facial hair, the exceptions being Andrew Johnson (1865\u201369) and William McKinley (1897\u20131901).   \n\nThe most recent president to have facial hair was William Howard Taft (1909\u20131913), who wore a mustache.       The last major party candidate to wear a beard was Charles Evans Hughes, who was defeated in 1916.   The last major party candidate for President to have facial hair was Thomas E. Dewey, who had a mustache, in 1944 and 1948.    Some pundits even claimed that public disapproval of Dewey's mustache may have contributed to his two electoral defeats.    \n\nSocial scientists have researched the effect of facial hair on the electability of Presidential candidates, and currently consider facial hair to have a negative effect on candidates.    Today, the existence of facial hair on potential presidential candidates is regularly noted (albeit somewhat jokingly) as a harmful factor.  \n\nFollowing is a list of American presidents who had facial hair at any time during their tenure. \n__TOC__\n\nList\nQuestion:\nWho was the first American president to have a beard\nAnswer:\nAbaraham lincoln\nPassage:\nSchick test\nThe Schick test, invented between 1910 and 1911  is a test used to determine whether or not a person is susceptible to diphtheria.   It was named after its inventor, B\u00e9la Schick (1877\u20131967), a Hungarian-born American pediatrician.\n\nThe test is a simple procedure.  A small amount (0.1 ml) of diluted (1/50 MLD) diphtheria toxin is injected intradermally into one arm of the person and a heat inactivated toxin on the other as a control.  If a person does not have enough antibodies to fight it off, the skin around the injection will become red and swollen, indicating a positive result.  This swelling disappears after a few days.  If the person has an immunity, then little or no swelling and redness will occur, indicating a negative result.\n\nResults can be interpreted as: \n# Positive: when the test results in a wheal of 5\u201310\u00a0mm diameter, reaching its peak in 4\u20137 days. The control arm shows no reaction. This indicates that the subject lacks antibodies against the toxin and hence is susceptible to the disease.\n# Pseudo-positive: when there is only a red colored inflammation (erythema)and it disappears within 4 days. This happens on both the arms since the subject is immune but hypersensitive to the toxin.\n# Negative reaction: Indicates that the person is immune\n# Combined reaction: Initial picture is like that of the pseudo-reaction but the erythema fades off after 4 days only in the control arm. It progresses on the test arm to a typical positive. The subject is interpreted to be both susceptible and hypersensitive.\n\nThe test was created when immunizing agents were scarce and not very safe, however as newer and safer toxoids were made available there was no more requirement for susceptibility tests.\nQuestion:\nA Schick test is a skin test for previously acquired immunity to which disease?\nAnswer:\nStrangling Angel\nPassage:\nPorridge (TV Series 1974\u20131977) - IMDb\nPorridge (TV Series 1974\u20131977) - IMDb\nIMDb\nThere was an error trying to load your rating for this title.\nSome parts of this page won't work property.

For instance, American football, association football, baseball, basketball, professional boxing, cricket, field hockey, Formula One, ice hockey, rugby football, team handball, tennis and volleyball are spectator sports, while hunting or underwater hockey typically are not. Spectator sports may be professional sports or amateur sports. They often are distinguished from participant sports, which are more recreational; golf and tennis can be either. Association football, also known as soccer, is by far the most watched sport on the planet.\n\nThe increasing broadcasting of sports events, along with media reporting can affect the number of people attending sports due to the ability to experience the sport without the need to physically attend and sometimes an increasingly enhanced experience including highlights, replays, commentary, statistics and analysis. Some sports are particularly known as \"armchair sports\" or \"lounge room sports\" due to the quality of the broadcasting experience in comparison to the live experience.\n\nSpectator sports have built their own set of culture and traditions including, in the United States, cheerleading and pre-game and half time entertainment such as fireworks, particularly for big games such as competition decider events and international tests. The passion of some sports fans also means that there are occasionally spectator incidents.\n\nNotable spectator sports events where events regularly sell out well in advance and are broadcast to large audiences include the FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, UEFA European Football Championship, Cricket World Cup, Commonwealth Games, The Ashes, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, Heineken Cup, Indian Premier League, Six Nations Championship, FA Cup, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Fu\u00dfball-Bundesliga, Australian Football League, Super League, Rugby League Challenge Cup, Grand Slam tennis, World Series Baseball, Rugby World Cup, Kentucky Derby, Melbourne Cup, PGA Tour, National Rugby League, All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, Wimbledon, Formula One, and NASCAR.\n\nThe North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM) devotes much of their annual conference to research addressing the psychology behind a desire to view spectator sports, and how it might be leveraged to increase demand. Much of the research focuses on exploiting a need for vicarious achievement, and a desire within the spectator to project a public image through a declaration of team allegiance.\n\nSeparation of the active and the passive, the line between sport and spectator, gives rise to the paradox of the spectator\u2014described by French philosopher Jacques Ranci\u00e8re; which is to seek an opportunity to passively contemplate engaging in an activity, and in doing so, forfeit that life moment one might have used to actually engage in the activity.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the most popular spectator sport in India?\nAnswer:\nCricket games\nPassage:\nThe | Define The at Dictionary.com\nThe | Define The at Dictionary.com\ndefinite article\n1.\n(used, especially before a noun, with a specifying or particularizing effect, as opposed to the indefinite or generalizing force of the indefinite article a or an):\nthe book you gave me; Come into the house.\n2.\n(used to mark a proper noun, natural phenomenon, ship, building, time, point of the compass, branch of endeavor, or field of study as something well-known or unique):\nthe sun; the Alps; the Queen Elizabeth; the past; the West.\n3.\n(used with or as part of a title):\nthe Duke of Wellington; the Reverend John Smith.\n4.\n(used to mark a noun as indicating the best-known, most approved, most important, most satisfying, etc.):\nthe skiing center of the U.S.; If you're going to work hard, now is the time.\n5.\n(used to mark a noun as being used generically):\nThe dog is a quadruped.\n6.\n(used in place of a possessive pronoun, to note a part of the body or a personal belonging):\nHe won't be able to play football until the leg mends.\n7.\n(used before adjectives that are used substantively, to note an individual, a class or number of individuals, or an abstract idea):\nto visit the sick; from the sublime to the ridiculous.\n8.\n(used before a modifying adjective to specify or limit its modifying effect):\nHe took the wrong road and drove miles out of his way.\n9.\n(used to indicate one particular decade of a lifetime or of a century):\nthe sixties; the Gay Nineties.\n10.\n(one of many of a class or type, as of a manufactured item, as opposed to an individual one):\nDid you listen to the radio last night?\n11.\nenough:\nHe saved until he had the money for a new car.

It starred Richard Burton as Leon Trotsky, as well as Romy Schneider and Alain Delon. A few years after release, The Assassination of Trotsky was included as one of the choices in the book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. \n\nPlot\n\nExiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, Leon Trotsky travels from Turkey to France to Norway, before arriving in Mexico in January 1937. The film begins in Mexico City in 1940, during a May Day celebration. Trotsky has not escaped the attention of the Soviet ruler of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, who sends out an assassin named Frank Jacson. The killer decides to infiltrate Trotsky's house by befriending one of the young communists in Trotsky's circle.\n\nCast\n\n* Richard Burton : Leon Trotsky\n* Alain Delon : Frank Jacson\n* Romy Schneider : Gita Samuels\n* Valentina Cortese : Natalia Sedowa Trotsky\n* Luigi Vannucchi : Ruiz\n* Jean Desailly : Alfred Rosmer\n* Simone Val\u00e8re : Marguerite Rosmer\n* Duilio Del Prete : Felipe\n* Jack Betts :  Lou (as Hunt Powers)\n* Michael Forest : Jim\n* Claudio Brook : Roberto\n* Joshua Sinclair : Sam\n* Giorgio Albertazzi : Commissioner\nProduction\n\nIn 1965 Josef Shaftel optioned the novel The Great Prince Died by Bernard Wolfe. The film was a co-production between the French Valoria Company and Dino De Laurentiis. It was to be shot in England  but was eventually filmed in Mexico. The movie used the Isaac Don Levine's book, The Mind of an Assassin as a source.\nQuestion:\nWhich British actor played the role of Leon Trotsky in the 1972 film \u2018The Assassination of Trotsky\u2019?\nAnswer:\nRichard Burton\nPassage:\nChina's Game Console Ban Lifted: How Will PS4, Xbox One ...\nChina's Game Console Ban Lifted: How Will PS4, Xbox One Make Money with So Much Piracy in the Country? : US News : Latin Post\nShare This Tweet This\nThis week China's government has lifted a 14-year old ban on devices. These devices included game consoles like our popular Xboxes , PlayStations and Wii devices. You see, in China, the government believed that these video games created a \"negative effect on the mental health of its youth .\"\u00a0Guess they changed their minds because as of now, China welcomes the popular game consoles Americans know so well.\nJust because the Chinese government had such a ban on our generation did not mean that the consoles and games were not being sold illegally or \"bootlegged.\" \u00a0This is where Microsoft, SONY and Nintendo will find a problem in sales. Yes, the ban is off, but kids are probably going to continue buying games for $1.65 from their usual bootlegger, instead of the $60 an average game goes for.\nZhang Yang has sold Xboxes, Wiis and PlayStations at his Beijing shop for as long as the devices have been available. \"The consoles that Zhang sells are smuggled into China, modified or 'cracked' to play pirated games,\" which has kept his shop up and running. Another problem that games corporation face are that Chinese gamers have became accustomed to playing free games on their PCs and mobiles through out the years. You cannot miss something you have never had.\nAdvertisement\n\"Console vendors will need to incorporate a business model for a piracy-rich environment,\" said Lisa Hanson, a \u00a0U.S. based Managing Director at Niko Partners , a research firm focused on Asian games market. \"They need to understand who the gamers are, what they demand, what are they not getting out of the current PC game experience that they could from a console game,\" Hanson added.\nSo while it is easy to sell Call of Duty to kids anywhere else in the world, a very carefully thought out marketing plan must teach Chinese kids how to appreciate the game. Something to also think about is how to convince parents in China to purchase the consoles and games for their \"positive shield minded\" kids. Have you seen that episode of South Park where Cartman organizes an entire Black Friday troop filled with betrayal and lies in order to get their hands on a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One? (Hilarious, by the way).\u00a0 Yeah... That's how obsessed gamers can really get.\nGood luck to game consoles in their new journey into success in the strict Chinese Market.\nQuestion:\nA fourteen year ban (for mental health reasons) on

Photograph: Julian Andrews/ Rex Features\nFriday 19 April 2013 12.59\u00a0EDT\nFirst published on Friday 19 April 2013 12.59\u00a0EDT\nShare on Messenger\nClose\nWere post-Olympics Britain to vote for a head girl, it would be a fair bet that the honour would fall to Clare Balding . If it's not shocking to learn from the\u00a0first volume of her endearing autobiography that she has form as a boarding school prefect, there are also little surprises embedded in the sports broadcaster's account of her early life. The daughter of a racehorse trainer, she measures out her life in ponies, boxers and lurchers, but even those who find the sporting life a distasteful mulch of dog slaver, moult and mucking out will find it hard to resist stories of the young Balding bowling into her house in filthy jodhpurs to find\u00a0the Queen eating breakfast, or the\u00a0Mean Girls atmosphere of boarding school pranks. Balding's love of animals is warmly expressed, a striking contrast to her rancour-free insights into a certain kind of English family, one who considered a brisk wave to be a public display of affection and who might easily forget to pick up their daughter for her first school holiday. As this biography underlines, however, she has turned out rather well.\nQuestion:\nMy Animals and Other Family is a 2013 autobiography by which TV and Radio presenter?\nAnswer:\nClare Balding\nPassage:\nSafety pin\nThe safety pin is a variation of the regular pin which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp.  The clasp serves two purposes: to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point.\n\nSafety pins are commonly used to fasten pieces of fabric or clothing together. Safety pins, or more usually a special version with an extra safe cover, called a nappy pin are widely used to fasten cloth diapers (nappies), as the safety clasp prevents the baby from being jabbed. Similarly, they can be used to patch torn or damaged clothing. Safety pins can also be used as an accessory in jewelry, like earrings, chains, and wristbands. Sometimes they are used to attach an embroidered patch. Size 3 is often used in  quilting and may be labelled for purchase as a \"quilting pin\". Size 4 and larger may be called \"blanket pins\" and deemed acceptable as  kilt pins for informal dress, depending upon design and appearance.\n\nEarly precursor\n\nThe fibula, a form of brooch, was invented by the Myceaneans on the Greek Peloponnesus between the 14th and 13th Century BC, and is considered an early precursor to a safety pin since they were used in a similar manner. However, it had a major flaw. It had no clasp or spring at the end to help put it in place. Over the centuries, the fibula became forgotten. \n\nInvention of the safety pin\n\nAmerican mechanic Walter Hunt is regarded as the inventor of the safety pin that bears resemblance to those used today. The safety pin included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place.   Charles Rowley (Birmingham, England) independently patented a similar safety pin in October 1849,  although the company no longer makes these.\n\nNeeding to settle a $15 debt with a friend, Hunt one day decided to invent something new in order to pay off his friend. He used a piece of brass wire that was about 8 inches long and made a coil in the center of the wire so it would open up when released. The clasp at one end was devised in order to shield the sharp edge from the user. \n\nAfter being issued U.S. patent #6,281 on April 10, 1849,  Hunt sold the patent to W. R. Grace and Company  for $400 (roughly $10,000 in 2008 dollars). Using that money, Hunt then paid the $15 owed to a friend and kept the remaining amount of $385 for himself. What Hunt failed to realize is that in the years to follow, W.R. Grace and Company would make millions of dollars in profits from his invention. \n\nLocking safety pin \n \nThis  has a special sliding cap over the top of the clasp to hold the pin more securely in place.\n\nNappy pin \n \nWhilst the cover on the safety pin makes it less likely to hurt someone, a version was invented specially for use with babies' nappies, the nappy pin.  This is larger and stronger than the typical safety pin. Modern nappy pins have the sliding cap to lock the pin.\n\nMedical aspects\n\nThe laryngologist Dr. Chevalier Jackson devised special instruments for removing swallowed safety pins. Because small children often swallowed them and open pins could be lodged dangerously in their throats, Jackson called them \"danger pins\" and sometimes displayed arrangements of those he had extracted. Safety pin ingestion is still a common problem in some countries, including Turkey, today. \n\nCulture\n\nDuring the emergence of punk rock in the late seventies, safety pins became associated with the genre, its followers and fashion.  Some claim the look was taken originally from Richard Hell whom the British punks saw in pictures, and whose style they adopted.  This is disputed by a number of artists from the first wave of British punks, most notably Johnny Rotten, who insists that safety pins were originally incorporated for more practical reasons, for example, to remedy \"the arse of your pants falling out\". British punk fans, after seeing the clothing worn by such punk forerunners, then incorporated safety pins into their own wardrobe as clothing decoration or as piercings, shifting the purpose of the pins from practicality to fashion. The safety pin subsequently has become an image associated with punk rock by media and pop-culture outlets.\nQuestion:\nWho invented the safety pin?\nAnswer:\nWALTER HUNT\nPassage:\nDiagram of the Human Body Using Etymologies - The ...\nDiagram of the Human Body Using Etymologies - The Examining Room of Dr. Charles\nThe Examining Room of Dr. Charles\nDiagram of the Human Body Using Etymologies\nJuly 11, 2013\nThe origin of a word is fascinating, and the etymology of a word\u2019s evolution tells a story. \u00a0You can almost picture syllables and letters marching like armies through distant lands \u2013 Old England, Low Germany, Ancient Greece\u2026 or rising up from a dark, primordial world of shapeless magic to take form and structure.\nI\u2019ve changed the anatomic names of the human body on this diagram to tell the story of each organ\u2019s epithet.

Over much of its range, it is resident year-round, but birds from the colder parts of the northern hemisphere typically migrate south (some well into the southern hemisphere) for the northern winter.\n\nDescription\n\nThe common buzzard measures between 40 and in length with a 109 - wingspan and a body mass of 427 -, making it a medium-sized raptor.\n\nThis broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus) and the only distantly related European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), which mimics the common buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from northern goshawks. The plumage can vary in Britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.\n\nSystematics\n\nThe common buzzard was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Falco buteo. Buteo is the Latin name for this species.81\n\nBuzzard subspecies fall into two groups.\nThe western Buteo group is mainly resident or short-distance migrants. They are:\n* Buteo buteo buteo: most of Europe\n* B. b. rothschildi: Azores\n* B. b. insularum: Canary Islands\n* B. b. pojana: Corsica and Sardinia\n* B. b. menetriesi: Caucasus\n* B. b. harterti: Madeira, doubtfully distinct from nominate buteo\n\nThe eastern vulpinus group includes\n* B. b. vulpinus (steppe buzzard): Eurasia: migrant breeder\n\nBehaviour\n\nThe common buzzard breeds in woodlands, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. It eats mainly small mammals, and will come to carrion. A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.\n\nBuzzards do not normally form flocks, but several may be seen together on migration or in good habitat. The Victorian writer on Dartmoor, William Crossing, noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places. Though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately 30 m apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. Pairs mate for life. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. This spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. He will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. He then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise.\n\nThe call is a plaintive peea-ay, similar to a cat's meow.\n\nStatus\n\nIn parts of its range it is increasing in numbers. In Ireland it became extinct about 1910, but began to slowly recolonise the country in the 1950s, and is now a common and familiar sight over much of Ireland.\n\nSteppe buzzard\n\nThe steppe buzzard, B. (b.) vulpinus breeds from east Europe eastward to the Far East, excluding Japan. It is a long-distance migrant, excepting some north Himalayan birds, and winters in Africa, India and southeastern Asia. In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.\n\nThe steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, B. vulpinus. Compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller (45 \u2013 long), longer winged and longer tailed. There are two colour morphs: the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (vulpes is Latin for \"fox\"), and a dark grey form.\n\nThe tail of vulpinus is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American red-tailed hawk. The upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. Adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in B. b. buteo.\nGallery\n\nButeo buteo -Hamerton Zoo, Cambridgeshire, England -head-8a.jpg|At Hamerton Zoo, England\nBuzzard UK09.JPG|In flight, Devon, England.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nRoy Greenslade\nRoy Greenslade (born 31 December 1946) is Professor of Journalism at City University London  and has been a media commentator since 1992, most especially for The Guardian. He writes a daily blog on The Guardian media site and wrote a column for the London Evening Standard for ten years from 2006.  \n\nEarly life and career\n\nHe was educated at Dagenham County High School (1957\u201363) and, aged 17, was hired by the Barking and Dagenham Advertiser. After serving a three-year indentureship he joined the Lancashire Evening Telegraph in Blackburn as a sub-editor before spending 18 months as a sub at the Manchester office of the Daily Mail.\n\nAt The Sun and elsewhere\n\nIn 1969, he entered Fleet Street as a news sub on The Sun, which had just been acquired by Rupert Murdoch. He had a brief spell with the Daily Mirror in 1972 before returning to The Sun as deputy chief sub-editor, first with the news desk and later in the features department.\n\nHe left The Sun in 1974 to write his first book and to take a degree in politics at the University of Sussex. He worked his way through university with part-time subbing jobs at the Brighton Argus, BBC Radio Brighton, the Sunday Mirror and Reveille. After graduating in 1979, he joined the Daily Star in Manchester for six months until being seconded to the Daily Express in London. He was soon appointed features editor of the Daily Star.\n\nIn 1981 he returned to The Sun as assistant editor. He was very involved in the move from Fleet Street to Wapping. Five years later, he transferred to The Sunday Times, first running the Review Section before becoming managing editor (news). In 1990, he was appointed by Robert Maxwell as editor of the Daily Mirror.\n\nWhile editor of the Daily Mirror, Greenslade was at the centre of a controversy after he rigged a competition in the paper to make sure it was unwinnable.  He admitted his behaviour in October 2011 at a seminar at the Leveson Inquiry: \u2033On behalf of my proprietor Robert Maxwell I fixed a game offering a million pounds to anyone who could spot the ball and ensured that no-one won. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa.\u2033 \n\nHe departed in March 1991 and later that year was consultant editor for three months to both The Sunday Times and Today.\n\nThe Guardian and other outlets\n\nFrom 1992 until 2005 he was media commentator for The Guardian. He presented BBC Radio 4's Mediumwave (1993\u201395) and in 1996 was the launch presenter of Britain Talks Back on Granada Talk TV. He has continued to be a regular broadcaster on media matters.\n\nAfter leaving The Guardian, he then spent three months with The Daily Telegraph in a similar capacity before returning to The Guardian to launch a media blog and began to write a weekly media column for the Evening Standard. His column for what is now the London Evening Standard lasted for ten years until April 2016, but he remains a contributor to the newspaper.  In the context of a changing industry, Greenslade concluded his last column for the London Evening Standard with the observation: \"Whatever happens, this I know:journalism, the trade I have practised for more than 50 years, must survive. Without it, democracy itself is imperilled\".\n\nOther work\n\nHe is on the board of the academic quarterly, the British Journalism Review, and is a trustee of the media ethics charity, MediaWise. In 2003, he was appointed Professor of Journalism at City University London in succession to Hugh Stephenson.\n\nGreenslade has been credited with coining the term: \"The Hierarchy of Death\" as well as writing extensively on the subject.  \n\nHe is also the author of three books, Goodbye to the Working Class (1976), Maxwell's Fall (1992) and Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda (2003).\n\nIrish republicanism\n\nDuring the late 1980s, when he was managing news editor of The Sunday Times, he secretly wrote for An Phoblacht, a newspaper published by Sinn F\u00e9in.  His pseudonym was 'George King'. This was exposed by Nick Davies, a Guardian colleague and instigator of the journalistic investigation into phone hacking. When Greenslade reviewed Davies's book on his blog in 2008, he did not deny his writings for An Phoblacht.  Greenslade also spoke at a Sinn F\u00e9in conference in London on the 30th anniversary of the hunger strikes, and he wrote an article on the same subject for An Phoblacht. He has had a house in County Donegal for many years, and a close personal friend is Pat Doherty, who from 1988 until 2009 was vice president of Sinn F\u00e9in, and who has been publicly named as a former member of the IRA Army Council.   He also stood surety for IRA member John Downey, one of the suspects in the 1982 bombing of Hyde Park which killed four soldiers. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHe is married to Noreen Taylor, the former Daily Mirror journalist and mother of actress Natascha McElhone.\nQuestion:\nWhich national newspaper has been edited by Roy Greenslade, Colin Myler and Piers Morgan?\nAnswer:\nThe Daily Mirror\nPassage:\nRepeat sign\nIn music, a repeat sign is a sign that indicates a section should be repeated. If the piece has one repeat sign alone, then that means to repeat from the beginning, and then continue on (or stop, if the sign appears at the end of the piece). A corresponding sign facing the other way indicates where the repeat is to begin. These are similar to the instructions da capo and dal segno.\n\nWhen a repeat calls for a different ending, numbered brackets above the bars indicate which to play the first time (1), which to play the second time (2), etc. These are called \"first-time bars\" and \"second-time bars,\" or \"first and second endings.\" They are also known as \"volta brackets\" and have no limit to how many there can be.\n\nIn Unicode\n\nIn Unicode, repeat signs are part of the Musical Symbols and are coded as follows:\n\nOther notation\n\nWhen only standard  keyboard characters are available, the punctuation marks vertical bar and colon are used to represent repeat signs: |: ... :|\n\nIn Gregorian chant, a repeat is indicated by a Roman numeral following a section. This is common particularly in a Kyrie, where the lines followed by \"iii\" are to be repeated three times (corresponding to the correct liturgical form).\n\nIn shape-note singing, repeat signs usually have four dots, between each line of the staff. The corresponding sign to show where the repeat is from is either the same sign reversed (if it is at the beginning of a bar), or the dots themselves (if it is in the middle of a bar). First and second endings are given with just the numbers above the corresponding bars. Repeats notated at the beginning of a verse, or given with multiple lines of text per verse, are generally required; the repeats given for most songs of the final few lines are optional, and almost always used only for the final verse sung.\nQuestion:\nWhat would you do if you found the instruction 'Da Capo' on a piece of music?\nAnswer:\nREPEAT FROM THE BEGINNING\nPassage:\nWhite Nile\nThe White Nile ( ') is a river of Africa, one of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the other being the Blue Nile. In the strict meaning, \"White Nile\" refers to the river formed at Lake No at the confluence of the Bahr al Jabal and Bahr el Ghazal Rivers.\n\nIn the wider sense, the term White Nile refers to the rivers draining from Lake Victoria into the White Nile proper (Victoria Nile, Kyoga Nile, Albert Nile, Bahr-al-Jabal). It may also, depending on the speaker, refer also to the headwaters of Lake Victoria (about  from the most remote sources down to Khartoum)\n\nThe 19th century search by Europeans for the source of the Nile was mainly focused on the White Nile, which disappeared into the depths of what was then known as 'Darkest Africa'. The White Nile's true source was not discovered until 1937, when the German explorer Burkhart Waldecker traced it to a stream in Rutovu at the base of Mount Kikizi.\n\nWhen in flood the Sobat River tributary carries a large amount of sediment, adding greatly to the White Nile's color. \n\nHeadwaters of Lake Victoria \n\nThe Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria near the Tanzanian town of Bukoba, is the longest feeder river for Lake Victoria, although sources do not agree on which is the longest tributary of the Kagera and hence the most distant source of the Nile itself. \n\nThe source of the Nile can be considered to be either the Ruvyironza, which emerges in Bururi Province, Burundi,  near Bukirasaz or the Nyabarongo, which flows from Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda.  The two feeder rivers meet near Rusumo Falls on the Rwanda-Tanzania border.\n\nThe falls are notable because of an event on 28\u201329 April 1994, when 250,000 Rwandans crossed the bridge at Rusumo Falls into Ngara, Tanzania in 24 hours, in what the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called \"the largest and fastest refugee exodus in modern times\". The Kagera forms part of the Rwanda\u2013Tanzania and Tanzania\u2013Uganda borders before flowing into Lake Victoria.\n\nIn Uganda \n\nThe river arising from Lake Victoria is known as the Victoria Nile. The place where it arises, just outside Jinja, is marked by a monument. After Nalubaale Power Station and Kiira Power Station at the mouth, the river goes through Bujagali Falls (location of Bujagali Power Station) about 15 kilometres downstream from Jinja.\n\nIt then flows north and westwards through Uganda, feeding into Lake Kyoga in the centre of the country and then out west. At Karuma Falls, the river sweeps under Karuma Bridge () at the southeastern corner of Murchison Falls National Park.\n\nDuring much of the insurgency of the Lord's Resistance Army, Karuma Bridge, built in 1963 to help the cotton industry, was the key stop on the way to Gulu, where vehicles would gather in convoy before being provided with a military escort for the final run north. In 2009, the Government of Uganda announced plans to construct a 750-MW hydropower project several kilometres north of the bridge, which is scheduled for completion in 2016. \n\nThe World Bank had approved to fund a smaller 200-MW power plant, but Uganda opted for a bigger project, which the Ugandans will fund internally, if necessary. \n\nJust before entering Lake Albert, the river is compressed into a passage seven metres in width at Murchison Falls, marking the entry into the western branch of the East African Rift. The river flows into Lake Albert opposite the Blue Mountains in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe river exiting Lake Albert to the north is known as the Albert Nile. It separates the West Nile sub-region of Uganda from the rest of the country. A bridge passes over the Albert Nile near its inlet in Nebbi District, but no other bridge over this section has been built. A powered ferry connects the roads between Adjumani and Moyo: navigation of the river is otherwise done by small boat or canoe.\n\nThe Mountain Nile  \n\nThe Albert Nile continues north to Nimule, where it enters South Sudan and becomes known as the Mountain Nile or Ba\u1e25r al-Jabal   (also Ba\u1e25r el-Jebel, ), literally \"Mountain River\" or \"River of the Mountain\". Bahr al Jabal also formerly lent its name to the state of Central Equatoria.\n\nThe Bahr al-Jabal then winds through rapids before entering the Sudan plain and the vast swamp of the Sudd. It makes its way to Lake No, where it merges with the Bahr el Ghazal and there forms the White Nile. An anabranch river called Bahr el Zeraf flows out of the Bahr al-Jabal at and flows through the Sudd, to eventually join the White Nile.\n\nThe Bahr al-Jabal passes through Juba, the capital of South Sudan, which is the southernmost navigable point on the Nile river system, and then to Kodok, the site of the 1898 Fashoda Incident that marked an end to the Scramble for Africa.\n\nThe river flows north into Sudan and lends its name to the Sudanese state of White Nile, before merging with the larger Blue Nile at Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and forming the River Nile.\nQuestion:\nIn which country does the White Nile leave Lake Victoria?\nAnswer:\nUgandese\nPassage:\nArmy of Republika Srpska\nThe Army of Republika Srpska (); Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian Vojska Republike Srpske (VRS)), also referred to as the Bosnian Serb Army, was the military of the Republika Srpska, an area which was previously the \"Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\", a self-proclaimed state within the internationally recognized territory of the sovereign Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn 2003 the army began to integrate into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2005 a fully integrated unit of Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats was deployed to augment the US-led coalition forces in Iraq. On 6 June 2006, it was fully integrated into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  \n\nHistory \n\nThe Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) was founded on 12 May 1992 from the remnants of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from which Bosnia and Herzegovina had seceded the same year. When the Bosnian War erupted, the JNA formally discharged 80,000 Bosnian Serb troops. These troops, who were allowed to keep their heavy weapons, formed the backbone of the newly formed Army of the Republika Srpska.  Aside from being made up almost entirely of Serb Orthodox officers and recruits from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the VRS also utilized the services of approximately 4,000 foreign Orthodox Christian volunteers to participate in combat operations during the Bosnian War. 1,000-1,500 of these came from Russia, and Bulgaria,  with 700 volunteers originating from Russia specifically.  100 Greeks also volunteered to fight on the side of the Bosnian Serbs, forming the Greek Volunteer Guard which allegedly participated in the Srebrenica massacre. \n\nThe military leader of the VRS was General Ratko Mladi\u0107, who is now indicted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for genocide, as are other high-ranking Serb officers.  Mladi\u0107 was arrested in Serbia on 26 May 2011.\n\nSpecial units \n\n* Panthers Guard Special Brigade (), East-Bosnian Corps \n* Wolves from the Drina, or Drina Wolves (), Drina Corps\n* Special Unit \"MANDO\" (), East-Bosnian Corps\n* Special Unit \"OSMACI\" (), Drina Corps\n* Serb Guard Ilid\u017ea (), Sarajevo-Romanija Corps\n* White Wolves ()\n\nOrganization \n\n1993 \n\n* 1st Krajina Corps \u2013 Banja Luka\n* 2nd Krajina Corps \u2013 Drvar\n* 3rd Corps \u2013 Bijeljina\n* East Bosnia Corps \u2013 Han Pijesak\n* Herzegovina Corps \u2013 Bile\u0107a\n\n1995 \n\n* 1st Krajina Corps \u2013 Banja Luka\n* 2nd Krajina Corps \u2013 Drvar\n* East Bosnia Corps \u2013 Bijeljina\n* Sarajevo-Romanija Corps \u2013 Pale\n* Drina Corps \u2013 Han Pijesak\n* Herzegovina Corps \u2013 Bile\u0107a\n\n2001 \n\n* 1st Corps \u2013 Banja Luka\n* 3rd Corps \u2013 Bijeljina\n* 5th Corps \u2013 Sokolac\n* 7th Corps \u2013 Bile\u0107a\n\nEquipment \n\nTanks and armoured vehicles \n\n* M-84\n* T-55\n* T-34\n* BVP M-80\n* OT M-60\n* BTR-50\n* BOV\n\nTowed artillery \n\n* M-56\n* D-30\n* M-30\n* M-46\n* D-20\n* M-84\n* M-1\n* ZiS-3\n\nSelf-propelled artillery \n\n* 2S1 Gvozdika\n\nMLRS \n\n* M-63 Plamen\n* M-77 Oganj\n* M-87 Orkan\n\nATGW \n\n* AT-3 and AT-5\n\nAntitank guns \n\n* T-12\n\nAnti-aircraft guns \n\n* ZSU-57-2\n* M53/59 Praga\n* BOV-3\n* ZU-23-2\n\nMANPADs and SAMs \n\n* SA-7\n* SA-18\n* SA-6\n* SA-9\n\nInfantry weapons \n\n* Zastava M70\n* Zastava M72\n* Zastava M84\n* Zastava M76\n* Heckler & Koch MP5\n* M79 Rocket Launcher\n* M80 Zolja\n\nRepublika Srpska Air Force \n\nFormerly known as Ratno Vazduhoplovstva i Protiv Vazdu\u0161na Odbrana Vojska Republike Srpske or RV i PVO RS.

Following a lengthy 10 year court case, Lagos State government offered other parcels of land as consideration for the Maroko development.\n\nMany scoffed at Chief Adeleke's decision to select the Ikoyi Island perimeter, however they were unable to appreciate the foresight of the Chief, who promptly engaged the Westminster Dredging Company to dredge the foreshore, and create six interlinked and symmetrical islands.\n\nHe wanted to create a development that would \"Make Nigeria Proud\", and engaged Minoru Yamasaki the architect of Manhattan's Twin Towers, to design replica twin towers as the flagship iconic buildings on the main island.\n\nTo complete the Lagoon City concept, Chief Adeleke planned an aesthetic design including a City Airport, which was a vision conceived long before the London Docklands Development, London City Airport, Dubai's Palm Islands or Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport.\n\nUnfortunately for the Chief, as soon as he had reclaimed the land and the brilliance of the idea was unveiled, others were determined to wrestle the land from him, and the project was 'acquired' again with no consideration being paid to City Property Development Limited. The 'acquisition' is currently being challenged in various courts, and there are Caveat Emptor warnings in place to warn prospective buyers that their investment could be at risk in future. There is also litigation pending in the UK and European courts regarding this matter.\n\nThe subsequent developers were principally interested in maximising the yield of the land at the expense of the aesthetic innovative design foreseen by Chief Adebayo Adeleke. Consequently, the land was filled in to create a banana shaped island, which has resolutely failed to achieve any international iconic architectural acclaim, as it is now a residential scheme rather than the commercial development originally envisaged.\n\nBanana Island, is an area of Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, 8.6 kilometres east of Tafawa Balewa Square. Part of the Lagos Local Government Area of Eti-Osa in Central Lagos, it is known for its wealthy, multi-cultural community and has some of the most expensive real estate in Nigeria.  Banana Island has one of the highest density of millionaires within its boundaries. \n\nDesign\n\nBanana Island is a man-made island in Lagos State, Nigeria that is slightly curved in shape \u2013 like a banana.  It is located in the Lagos Lagoon and is connected to Ikoyi Island by a dedicated road which is linked to the existing road network near Parkview Estate.  The island was constructed by the Lebanese-Nigerian Chagoury Group in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing    and is considered to be on par with the Seventh Arrondissement in Paris, La Jolla in San Diego, and Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya and Roppongi neighbourhoods.\n\nIt occupies a sand-filled area of approximately 1,630,000 square metres and is divided into 536 plots (of between 1000 and 4000 square metres in size) mainly arranged along cul-de-sacs, so designed to enhance the historically residential nature of Ikoyi. Residents are provided with world class utilities including underground electrical systems (versus the overhead cabling common throughout Lagos), an underground water supply network, a central sewage system and treatment plant, and street lighting and satellite telecommunications networks. \n\nThe Island is a planned, mixed development with dedicated areas for residential, commercial and recreational activities.  On the residential side of the Island, planning permission is not granted for dwellings over 3 storeys high. The developers also intend to develop a main piazza, a club-house, a primary and secondary school, a fire and police station and a medical clinic. They are also negotiating to build a 5-star hotel on the island, along with an array of smaller Guest Houses.\n\nComposition\n\nBanana Island hosts several high end residential developments such as Ocean Parade Towers   - a series of 14 luxury tower blocks strategically situated at one end of the island to take advantage of 180 degree panoramic views overlooking the lagoon. Similar to many of the developments on the island, it has dedicated leisure facilities such as a private health club - with tennis courts, squash courts and a swimming pool surrounded by extensive gardens.   At launch flats in Ocean Parade sold for over US$400,000. \n\nSeveral leading Nigerian and International corporates such as - Etisalat Nigeria,  Airtel Nigeria,  Ford Foundation Nigeria  and Olaniwun Ajayi & Co  - are also based on Banana Island.\n\nNotable residents\n\n*Mike Adenuga - Billionaire owner of Globacom - Nigeria\u2019s second-largest telecom operator and oil exploration firm Conoil. \n*Iyabo Obasanjo - Daughter of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Oluremi Obasanjo, Elected to the Nigerian Senate representing Ogun Central Senatorial District of Ogun State,  Senior Fellow at Harvard's Advanced Leadership Initiative.\n*Saayu Dantata - Son of Alhassan Dantata - the wealthiest man in West Africa at the time of his death in 1955.\n*Kola Abiola - son of MKO Abiola - prominent businessman, publisher and politician. He is widely regarded as the presumed winner of the 1993 presidential elections.\nQuestion:\nBanana Island is the most expensive property in a special edition of monopoly based on which Nigerian city?\nAnswer:\nLagos city\nPassage:\nDili\nDili (Portuguese/Tetum: D\u00edli, Indonesian: Kota Dili) is the capital, largest city, chief port and commercial centre of East Timor.\n\nGeography and administration\n\nDili lies on the northern coast of Timor island, the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is the seat of the administration of the district of Dili, which is the administrative entity of the area and includes the island of Atauro and some cities close to Dili city. The city is divided into the subdistricts of Nain Feto, Vera Cruz, Dom Aleixo and Cristo Rei and is divided into several sucos, which are headed by an elected chefe de suco. 18 of the 26 sucos of the four subdistricts are categorised as urban. \n\nThere is no city administration beside the district administrator, who was appointed by state government. The East Timorese government started to plan in 2009 to change the status of districts into municipalities. These will have an elected mayor and council. \n\nDemography\n\nThe 2010 census recorded a population of 193,563 in the areas of Dili district classified as urban, with a population of 234,331 in the whole district including rural areas such as Atauro and Metinaro.\n\nDili is a melting pot of the different ethnic groups of East Timor, due partly to the internal migration of young men from around the country in search of work.  This has led to a gender imbalance, with the male population significantly larger than the female.  Between 2001 and 2004, the population of Dili district grew by 12.58%, with only 54% of the district's inhabitants born in the city.  7% were born in Bacau, 5% each in Viqueque and Bobonaro  4% in Ermera, and the remainder in other districts or overseas. \n\nClimate\n\nDili has a Tropical wet and dry climate under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification.\n\nHistory\n\nDili was settled about 1520 by the Portuguese, who made it the capital of Portuguese Timor in 1769.  It was proclaimed a city in January 1864. During World War II, Portugal and its colonies remained neutral, but the Allies saw East Timor as a potential target for Japanese invasion, and Australian and Dutch forces briefly occupied the island in 1941.  In the night of 19 February 1942, the Japanese attacked with a force of around 20,000 men, and occupied Dili before spreading out across the rest of the colony.  On 26 September 1945, control of the island was officially returned to Portugal by the Japanese.\n\nEast Timor unilaterally declared independence from Portugal on 28 November 1975. However, nine days later, on 7 December, Indonesian forces invaded Dili. On 17 July 1976, Indonesia annexed East Timor, which it designated the 27th province of Indonesia, Timor Timur (Indonesian for East Timor), with Dili as its capital. A guerrilla war ensued from 1975 to 1999 between Indonesian and pro-independence forces, during which tens of thousands of East Timorese and some foreign civilians were killed. Media coverage of the 1991 Dili Massacre helped revitalise international support for the East Timorese independence movement.\n\nIn 1999, East Timor was placed under UN supervision and on 20 May 2002, Dili became the capital of the newly independent Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. In May 2006, fighting and rioting sparked by conflict between elements of the military caused significant damage to the city and led to foreign military intervention to restore order.\n\nBuildings and monuments\n\nMost buildings were damaged or destroyed in the violence of 1999, orchestrated by the Indonesian military and local pro-Indonesia militias (see Operation Scorched Earth).  However, the city still has many buildings from the Portuguese era. The former Portuguese Governor's office is now the office of the Prime Minister. It was previously also used by the Indonesian-appointed Governor, and by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).\n\nEven under Indonesian rule, during which the Portuguese language was banned, Portuguese street names like Avenida Marechal Carmona remained unchanged, although they were prefixed with the Indonesian word Jalan or 'road'. The Roman Catholic Church at Motael became a focus for resistance to Indonesian occupation. Legacies of Jakarta's occupation are the Church of the Immaculate Conception, seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of D\u00edli, purportedly the largest cathedral in Southeast Asia, and the 'Integration Monument', commemorating the Indonesian annexation of the territory in 1976. Featuring a statue of an East Timorese in traditional dress, breaking the chains round his wrists, the monument has not been demolished.\n\nThe Cristo Rei of Dili is a 27-metre (88.6\u00a0ft) tall statue of Jesus situated on top of a globe at the end of a peninsula in Dili. It is one of the town's landmarks.  It was a present from the Indonesian Government during occupation for the 20th anniversary of East Timor's integration into Indonesia.\n\nEducation\n\nSchools in Dili include St. Joseph\u2019s High School (Col\u00e9gio de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9).\nThere are four International schools in Dili, a Portuguese school by the name of Escola Portuguesa Ruy Cinatti, an Australian managed school by the name of Dili International School, an American government sponsored school called QSI International School of Dili and the Maharlika International School (Formerly Dili Education & Development Center), a Philippine International School.  East Timor's major higher education institution, the Universidade Nacional de Timor-Leste, is based in Dili.\n\nTransportation\n\nDili is served by Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport, named after independence leader Nicolau Lobato.  This is the only functioning international airport in East Timor, though there are airstrips in Baucau, Suai and Oecusse used for domestic flights.  Until recently, Dili's airport runway has been unable to accommodate aircraft larger than the Boeing 737 or C-130 Hercules, but in January 2008, the Portuguese charter airline EuroAtlantic Airways operated a direct flight from Lisbon using a Boeing 757, carrying 140 members of the Guarda Nacional Republicana. \n\nUnder Portuguese rule, Baucau Airport, which has a much longer runway, was used for international flights, but following the Indonesian invasion this was taken over by the Indonesian military and closed to civilian traffic.\n\nTwin towns \u2013 Sister cities\n\nDili is twinned with the following places:\nQuestion:\nDili is the capital of which country?\nAnswer:\nOperation STABILISE\nPassage:\nFrances Tomelty\nFrances Tomelty (born 6 Oct 1948) is a Northern Irish actress.\n\nCareer\n\nTomelty was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the daughter of actor Joseph Tomelty (5 March 1911 \u2013 7 June 1995). She has featured in series including Bergerac, Inspector Morse, Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, Strangers, Midsomer Murders and Coronation Street, Cracker, as well as many films including Bellman and True, Monk Dawson, Bullshot and The Field. She was Lady Macbeth in the Old Vic's disastrous 1980 production of Macbeth, with Peter O'Toole in the title role. \n\nTomelty's roles in recent years include the drama series Spooks, Casualty, The Amazing Mrs Pritchard, Holby City, Law & Order: UK, The Royal, Waking the Dead, Silent Witness,  Unforgotten as well as big-budget adaptations Atlantis, Merlin, The White Queen, and A Perfect Spy, and the film Ch\u00e9ri.\n\nPersonal life\n\nOn 1 May 1976, Tomelty married musician Gordon \"Sting\" Sumner \u2013 best known as the lead singer and bassist for the rock band The Police \u2013 after knowing him for two years. They met on the set of a rock-musical called Rock Nativity.  She played the Virgin Mary; he played in the band. They have two children together, Joseph (born 23 November 1976) and Fuchsia Katherine (\"Kate\") (born 17 April 1982). Sumner left Tomelty for his current wife Trudie Styler, and the couple divorced in 1984. The split was controversial; as The Independent reported in 2006, \"The problem was, he was already married \u2013 to actress Frances Tomelty, who just happened to be Trudie's best friend (Sting and Frances lived next door to Trudie in Bayswater, west London, for several years before the two of them became lovers). The affair was widely condemned \u2013 not least because it coincided with the break-up of the Police.\"\nQuestion:\nWhich music star married Frances Tomelty in 1976?\nAnswer:\nSting (pain)\nPassage:\nJoey Buttafuoco\nJoseph A. \"Joey\" Buttafuoco (born March 11, 1956) is an auto body shop owner from Long Island. He is best known for having had an affair with Amy Fisher. Fisher, who was 17 years old at the time, subsequently shot Buttafuoco's wife, Mary Jo Buttafuoco, in the face. Popular news coverage titled Fisher the \"Long Island Lolita.\"  Buttafuoco subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape and served four months in jail. \n\nShooting incident\n\nOn May 19, 1992, Amy Fisher shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco in the right side of the face. Fisher had come to the Buttafuocos' house to confront Mary Jo Buttafuoco about Joey Buttafuoco, with whom she had been having an affair since July 1991 after Fisher brought her vehicle to Buttafuoco's auto body shop in Baldwin, Nassau County. When Mary Jo answered the door, Fisher\u2014posing as her own (fictitious) sister Ann Marie\u2014offered as proof of the affair a T-shirt that Joey had given her, with the logo of his auto body shop on it. The front porch confrontation escalated, and when Mary Jo demanded that Fisher leave and turned to go into the house and call Joey, Fisher shot her in the face with a .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol. Once Mary Jo regained consciousness, she identified Fisher as her assailant.\n\nThe investigation of the shooting and the subsequent court cases involved a series of conflicting claims, and received significant news coverage in both mainstream news outlets and tabloids.  Buttafuoco's lawyer maintained that Buttafuoco was never involved with Fisher and Fisher had invented the affair, while Fisher's lawyer portrayed Fisher as a victim whom Buttafuoco manipulated into the shooting. \n\nAfter Fisher's assault conviction, Buttafuoco was indicted on 19 counts of statutory rape, sodomy, and endangering the welfare of a child. He initially pleaded not guilty.  He later changed his plea to guilty, admitting he had sex with Fisher when she was 16 and that he had known her age at the time.   He was sentenced to six months' jail time, and was released after serving four months and nine days of the sentence. \n\nAfter his release from prison, Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuoco moved to California, where Mary Jo filed divorce papers in Ventura County Superior Court on February 3, 2003. \n\nUnrelated charges\n\nButtafuoco has been charged with crimes on several occasions since the 1992 shooting incident.\n\n* In 1995, he pleaded no contest to a solicitation of prostitution charge and was fined and placed on probation for two years. \n* In 2004, he was sentenced to a year in jail and five years of probation after pleading guilty to auto insurance fraud. As part of the sentence, he is prohibited from working in the auto body industry in California for the rest of his life. \n* In August 2005, he was charged with illegal possession of ammunition. As a convicted felon, he is legally not permitted to own ammunition. Probation officers found the ammunition during a search of his home. He pleaded no contest and began serving his sentence on January 8, 2007.  He was released on April 28, 2007.\n\nMedia appearances\n\nThe significant coverage of the shooting incident made Buttafuoco a minor celebrity. During Fisher's trial, Buttafuoco appeared frequently on mainstream and tabloid news programs and talk shows, and gave multiple interviews to all forms of media. David Letterman, in his last year of hosting Late Night with David Letterman, discussed the incident so often that Buttafuoco's name was a recurring punchline,  while Saturday Night Live parodied the case in multiple sketches. \n\nIn 2002, Buttafuoco participated in the Fox Network's Celebrity Boxing, originally slated to oppose John Wayne Bobbitt, who dropped out due to being arrested for domestic abuse. Bobbitt was replaced by female pro wrestler Joanie \"Chyna\" Laurer.  Buttafuoco, despite being booed, won the fight in a majority decision (29\u201328, 29\u201327, 28\u201328).\n\nIn 2006, he and Amy Fisher were reunited at the Lingerie Bowl for the coin toss.   In a story reported in the New York Post, reality show producer David Krieff suggested that Buttafuoco and Fisher were then \"dating\" again, although this was not supported by any direct statements from either Buttafuoco or Fisher.  On May 23, 2007, Mary Jo Buttafuocco appeared on CNN's Larry King Live program to discuss the recent reunion of her ex-husband and the former \"Long Island Lolita.\" At the time, Buttafuoco's second wife, Evanka, had recently filed for divorce, but withdrew her divorce petition on June 22, 2007. \n\nButtafuoco appeared on the Judge Jeanine Pirro show on March 5, 2009. He sued a woman who had attempted to pay for $4,700 in repairs to her Corvette in sexual favors rather than money. Buttafuoco won the case.\n\nIn 2012, Buttafuoco appeared on the Fox News program Justice with Judge Jeanine, offering commentary on a murder-for-hire plot.\n\nButtafuoco appeared on Judge Alex on November 1, 2012. He sued his friend Rob Spallone's company over a dispute regarding the rental of a frozen ice truck for Buttafuoco's nephew's birthday party. Buttafuoco won the case and Spallone was ordered to pay $4,400 in damages.\n\nTV and film career\n\nButtafuoco made his film debut as a cab driver in Cul-de-Sac (video title: Better Than Ever). He subsequently appeared in The Underground Comedy Movie, Mafia Movie Madness, Skin Walker, Finding Forrester and Operation Repo: The Movie.\nQuestion:\nMarch 11, 1958 was the birthday of statutory rapist Joey Buttafuoco, who achieved his fame when what underage mistress, known as the Long Island Lolita, shot his wife?\nAnswer:\nAmy Fisher\nPassage:\nFrank Williams (actor)\nFrank Williams (born 2 July 1931)  is an English actor best known for playing Timothy Farthing, the vicar in the popular BBC comedy Dad's Army. Following the death of Pamela Cundell in 2015, he and Ian Lavender are the last surviving major cast members. He reprised the role of Farthing in the 2016 film adaptation of the series. \n\nBiography\n\nBorn in London, Williams was educated at Ardingly College, West Sussex and Hendon School (then Hendon County School). He appeared regularly in the TV series The Army Game (1957\u201360) as Captain Pocket. His film roles include Norman Wisdom films: The Square Peg (1958), The Bulldog Breed (1960), and A Stitch In Time (1963). He had a leading role in the BBC TV series Diary of a Young Man (1964), which was partly directed by Ken Loach, in addition to small parts in numerous popular TV series of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIt is however for his role in Dad's Army   as Timothy Farthing, that Williams is best known. Coincidentally, while at Hendon County, he had played the lead in the school play of his final year, The Ghost Train, written nearly 30 years earlier by Arnold Ridley, who would become one of his fellow actors in Dad's Army.\n\nIn 1970, he starred with Tessie O'Shea in the short-lived sitcom As Good Cooks Go. In 1967 and again in 1971, Williams appeared in an episode of All Gas and Gaiters as one of the vicars choral. In 1972, at the height of his Dad's Army fame, he had a cameo role in Monty Python's Flying Circus. He also had an occasional role as a Bishop in You Rang, M'Lord?.\n\nHe lived for many years in Edgware, Middlesex. Until 2000, he was a lay member of the General Synod of the Church of England. Williams was a guest on This Morning on Thursday 31 July 2008, talking about Dad's Army with fellow cast members, Ian Lavender and Bill Pertwee. He also appeared on BBC1's Jonathan Ross Salutes Dad's Army show on Sunday 3 August 2008.  \n\nHe is the author of several plays, including The Playing Fields and Murder Weekend, some of which have been performed in the pro-amateur theatre.\n\nHis autobiography, Vicar to Dad's Army: the Frank Williams story, was published in 2002.\n\nWith other surviving members of the Dad's Army cast he walked in the 100th Birthday parade for Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, whose favourite programme it had been.\n\nWilliams is the patron of Veneratio, a charity established to counter the social isolation of the elderly.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the vicar in \u2018Dad\u2019s Army\u2019?\nAnswer:\nWarden Hodges\nPassage:\nEurasian hobby\nThe Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), or just simply hobby, is a small slim falcon. It belongs to a rather close-knit group of similar falcons often considered a subgenus Hypotriorchis.\n\nDescription\n\nAdults are slate-grey above with a dark crown and two short black moustachial stripes. The throat is unstreaked white, thighs and undertail coverts are unstreaked rufous and rest of the underparts are whitish with black streaks. Close views enable the red \"trousers\" and vent to be seen. Sexes are similar. Juveniles are generally much browner, with scaled upper parts and streaked buffy thighs and undertail coverts.\n\nThe hobby has a distinct first-summer plumage.\n\nThis falcon is  in length with a wingspan of 74 \u2013 and a weight of 175 \u2013.\n\nFile:Falco subbuteo from Kadzidlowo.jpg|Falco subbuteo from Kadzidlowo\nFile:Kobuz (Falco subbuteo).jpg|Juvenile Falco subbuteo portrait\nFile:Falco subbuteo kobuz1.jpg|In flight\n\nTaxonomy and systematics\n\nThis species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Falco subbuteo.\n\nCurrently two subspecies are recognized:\n\n* F. s. subbuteo: the nominate race is resident in Africa, Europe and Central and East Asia, winters in Central and South Africa and South Asia\n* F. s. streichi: described by Hartert and Neumann in 1907, is smaller in size and is found further east of F. s. subbuteos distribution range\n\nThe genus name falco derives from Late Latin falx, falcis, a sickle, referring to the claws of the bird. The species name subbuteo is from Latin sub, \"near to\" and buteo, \" buzzard\" . The species' English name comes from Old French hob\u00e9 or hobet. It became the trademark for the Subbuteo games company after its creator was refused permission to register \"Hobby\". \n\nDistribution and status\n\nThis species breeds across Africa, Europe and Asia. It is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa and Asia.\n\nBehaviour and ecology\n\nIt is a bird of open country such as farmland, marshes, taiga and savannah. They are widespread in lowlands with scattered small woods. It is an elegant bird of prey, appearing sickle-like in flight with its long pointed wings and square tail, often resembling a swift when gliding with folded wings. It flies powerfully and fast. It will take large insects, such as dragonflies, which it transfers from talons to beak and eats while soaring slowly in circles. It also captures small bats  and small birds like swallows, swifts, pipits etc. in flight. Its speed and aerobatic skills enable it to take swallows and even swifts on the wing, and barn swallows or house martins have a characteristic \"hobby\" alarm call. It is known to harass swallows while they are roosting and dispersing from roosts. When not breeding, it is crepuscular, hawking principally in the mornings and evenings. While on migration, they may move in small groups.\n\nHobbies nest in old nests of crows and other birds. The tree selected is most often one in a hedge or on the extreme edge of a spinney, whence the bird can observe intruders from a considerable distance. It lays 2\u20134 eggs. Incubation is said to take 28 days and both parents share in this duty, though the female does the greater part.\n\nIt is a very bold and courageous bird and was used in falconry, trained to hawk birds like quails, larks, hoopoes, drongos, etc.\nQuestion:\nFalco subbuteo is the scientific name for which small falcon?\nAnswer:\nHOBBY\n\n\nPassage:\nsheet music - 'Fine' at the end of the song - Music ...\nsheet music - 'Fine' at the end of the song - Music: Practice & Theory Stack Exchange\n'Fine' at the end of the song\n5\n\u00a0\nI always like to think of it as a little congratulatory note waiting there at the end of the tune for me.

He writes a daily blog on The Guardian media site and wrote a column for the London Evening Standard for ten years from 2006.  \n\nEarly life and career\n\nHe was educated at Dagenham County High School (1957\u201363) and, aged 17, was hired by the Barking and Dagenham Advertiser. After serving a three-year indentureship he joined the Lancashire Evening Telegraph in Blackburn as a sub-editor before spending 18 months as a sub at the Manchester office of the Daily Mail.\n\nAt The Sun and elsewhere\n\nIn 1969, he entered Fleet Street as a news sub on The Sun, which had just been acquired by Rupert Murdoch. He had a brief spell with the Daily Mirror in 1972 before returning to The Sun as deputy chief sub-editor, first with the news desk and later in the features department.\n\nHe left The Sun in 1974 to write his first book and to take a degree in politics at the University of Sussex. He worked his way through university with part-time subbing jobs at the Brighton Argus, BBC Radio Brighton, the Sunday Mirror and Reveille. After graduating in 1979, he joined the Daily Star in Manchester for six months until being seconded to the Daily Express in London. He was soon appointed features editor of the Daily Star.\n\nIn 1981 he returned to The Sun as assistant editor. He was very involved in the move from Fleet Street to Wapping. Five years later, he transferred to The Sunday Times, first running the Review Section before becoming managing editor (news). In 1990, he was appointed by Robert Maxwell as editor of the Daily Mirror.\n\nWhile editor of the Daily Mirror, Greenslade was at the centre of a controversy after he rigged a competition in the paper to make sure it was unwinnable.  He admitted his behaviour in October 2011 at a seminar at the Leveson Inquiry: \u2033On behalf of my proprietor Robert Maxwell I fixed a game offering a million pounds to anyone who could spot the ball and ensured that no-one won. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa.\u2033 \n\nHe departed in March 1991 and later that year was consultant editor for three months to both The Sunday Times and Today.\n\nThe Guardian and other outlets\n\nFrom 1992 until 2005 he was media commentator for The Guardian. He presented BBC Radio 4's Mediumwave (1993\u201395) and in 1996 was the launch presenter of Britain Talks Back on Granada Talk TV. He has continued to be a regular broadcaster on media matters.\n\nAfter leaving The Guardian, he then spent three months with The Daily Telegraph in a similar capacity before returning to The Guardian to launch a media blog and began to write a weekly media column for the Evening Standard. His column for what is now the London Evening Standard lasted for ten years until April 2016, but he remains a contributor to the newspaper.  In the context of a changing industry, Greenslade concluded his last column for the London Evening Standard with the observation: \"Whatever happens, this I know:journalism, the trade I have practised for more than 50 years, must survive. Without it, democracy itself is imperilled\".\n\nOther work\n\nHe is on the board of the academic quarterly, the British Journalism Review, and is a trustee of the media ethics charity, MediaWise. In 2003, he was appointed Professor of Journalism at City University London in succession to Hugh Stephenson.\n\nGreenslade has been credited with coining the term: \"The Hierarchy of Death\" as well as writing extensively on the subject.  \n\nHe is also the author of three books, Goodbye to the Working Class (1976), Maxwell's Fall (1992) and Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda (2003).\n\nIrish republicanism\n\nDuring the late 1980s, when he was managing news editor of The Sunday Times, he secretly wrote for An Phoblacht, a newspaper published by Sinn F\u00e9in.  His pseudonym was 'George King'. This was exposed by Nick Davies, a Guardian colleague and instigator of the journalistic investigation into phone hacking. When Greenslade reviewed Davies's book on his blog in 2008, he did not deny his writings for An Phoblacht.  Greenslade also spoke at a Sinn F\u00e9in conference in London on the 30th anniversary of the hunger strikes, and he wrote an article on the same subject for An Phoblacht. He has had a house in County Donegal for many years, and a close personal friend is Pat Doherty, who from 1988 until 2009 was vice president of Sinn F\u00e9in, and who has been publicly named as a former member of the IRA Army Council.   He also stood surety for IRA member John Downey, one of the suspects in the 1982 bombing of Hyde Park which killed four soldiers. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHe is married to Noreen Taylor, the former Daily Mirror journalist and mother of actress Natascha McElhone.\nQuestion:\nWhich national newspaper has been edited by Roy Greenslade, Colin Myler and Piers Morgan?\nAnswer:\nThe Daily Mirror\nPassage:\nRepeat sign\nIn music, a repeat sign is a sign that indicates a section should be repeated. If the piece has one repeat sign alone, then that means to repeat from the beginning, and then continue on (or stop, if the sign appears at the end of the piece). A corresponding sign facing the other way indicates where the repeat is to begin. These are similar to the instructions da capo and dal segno.\n\nWhen a repeat calls for a different ending, numbered brackets above the bars indicate which to play the first time (1), which to play the second time (2), etc. These are called \"first-time bars\" and \"second-time bars,\" or \"first and second endings.\" They are also known as \"volta brackets\" and have no limit to how many there can be.\n\nIn Unicode\n\nIn Unicode, repeat signs are part of the Musical Symbols and are coded as follows:\n\nOther notation\n\nWhen only standard  keyboard characters are available, the punctuation marks vertical bar and colon are used to represent repeat signs: |: ... :|\n\nIn Gregorian chant, a repeat is indicated by a Roman numeral following a section. This is common particularly in a Kyrie, where the lines followed by \"iii\" are to be repeated three times (corresponding to the correct liturgical form).\n\nIn shape-note singing, repeat signs usually have four dots, between each line of the staff. The corresponding sign to show where the repeat is from is either the same sign reversed (if it is at the beginning of a bar), or the dots themselves (if it is in the middle of a bar). First and second endings are given with just the numbers above the corresponding bars. Repeats notated at the beginning of a verse, or given with multiple lines of text per verse, are generally required; the repeats given for most songs of the final few lines are optional, and almost always used only for the final verse sung.\nQuestion:\nWhat would you do if you found the instruction 'Da Capo' on a piece of music?\nAnswer:\nREPEAT FROM THE BEGINNING\nPassage:\nWhite Nile\nThe White Nile ( ') is a river of Africa, one of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the other being the Blue Nile. In the strict meaning, \"White Nile\" refers to the river formed at Lake No at the confluence of the Bahr al Jabal and Bahr el Ghazal Rivers.\n\nIn the wider sense, the term White Nile refers to the rivers draining from Lake Victoria into the White Nile proper (Victoria Nile, Kyoga Nile, Albert Nile, Bahr-al-Jabal). It may also, depending on the speaker, refer also to the headwaters of Lake Victoria (about  from the most remote sources down to Khartoum)\n\nThe 19th century search by Europeans for the source of the Nile was mainly focused on the White Nile, which disappeared into the depths of what was then known as 'Darkest Africa'. The White Nile's true source was not discovered until 1937, when the German explorer Burkhart Waldecker traced it to a stream in Rutovu at the base of Mount Kikizi.\n\nWhen in flood the Sobat River tributary carries a large amount of sediment, adding greatly to the White Nile's color. \n\nHeadwaters of Lake Victoria \n\nThe Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria near the Tanzanian town of Bukoba, is the longest feeder river for Lake Victoria, although sources do not agree on which is the longest tributary of the Kagera and hence the most distant source of the Nile itself. \n\nThe source of the Nile can be considered to be either the Ruvyironza, which emerges in Bururi Province, Burundi,  near Bukirasaz or the Nyabarongo, which flows from Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda.  The two feeder rivers meet near Rusumo Falls on the Rwanda-Tanzania border.\n\nThe falls are notable because of an event on 28\u201329 April 1994, when 250,000 Rwandans crossed the bridge at Rusumo Falls into Ngara, Tanzania in 24 hours, in what the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called \"the largest and fastest refugee exodus in modern times\". The Kagera forms part of the Rwanda\u2013Tanzania and Tanzania\u2013Uganda borders before flowing into Lake Victoria.\n\nIn Uganda \n\nThe river arising from Lake Victoria is known as the Victoria Nile. The place where it arises, just outside Jinja, is marked by a monument. After Nalubaale Power Station and Kiira Power Station at the mouth, the river goes through Bujagali Falls (location of Bujagali Power Station) about 15 kilometres downstream from Jinja.\n\nIt then flows north and westwards through Uganda, feeding into Lake Kyoga in the centre of the country and then out west. At Karuma Falls, the river sweeps under Karuma Bridge () at the southeastern corner of Murchison Falls National Park.\n\nDuring much of the insurgency of the Lord's Resistance Army, Karuma Bridge, built in 1963 to help the cotton industry, was the key stop on the way to Gulu, where vehicles would gather in convoy before being provided with a military escort for the final run north. In 2009, the Government of Uganda announced plans to construct a 750-MW hydropower project several kilometres north of the bridge, which is scheduled for completion in 2016. \n\nThe World Bank had approved to fund a smaller 200-MW power plant, but Uganda opted for a bigger project, which the Ugandans will fund internally, if necessary. \n\nJust before entering Lake Albert, the river is compressed into a passage seven metres in width at Murchison Falls, marking the entry into the western branch of the East African Rift. The river flows into Lake Albert opposite the Blue Mountains in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe river exiting Lake Albert to the north is known as the Albert Nile. It separates the West Nile sub-region of Uganda from the rest of the country. A bridge passes over the Albert Nile near its inlet in Nebbi District, but no other bridge over this section has been built. A powered ferry connects the roads between Adjumani and Moyo: navigation of the river is otherwise done by small boat or canoe.\n\nThe Mountain Nile  \n\nThe Albert Nile continues north to Nimule, where it enters South Sudan and becomes known as the Mountain Nile or Ba\u1e25r al-Jabal   (also Ba\u1e25r el-Jebel, ), literally \"Mountain River\" or \"River of the Mountain\". Bahr al Jabal also formerly lent its name to the state of Central Equatoria.\n\nThe Bahr al-Jabal then winds through rapids before entering the Sudan plain and the vast swamp of the Sudd. It makes its way to Lake No, where it merges with the Bahr el Ghazal and there forms the White Nile. An anabranch river called Bahr el Zeraf flows out of the Bahr al-Jabal at and flows through the Sudd, to eventually join the White Nile.\n\nThe Bahr al-Jabal passes through Juba, the capital of South Sudan, which is the southernmost navigable point on the Nile river system, and then to Kodok, the site of the 1898 Fashoda Incident that marked an end to the Scramble for Africa.\n\nThe river flows north into Sudan and lends its name to the Sudanese state of White Nile, before merging with the larger Blue Nile at Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and forming the River Nile.\nQuestion:\nIn which country does the White Nile leave Lake Victoria?\nAnswer:\nUgandese\nPassage:\nArmy of Republika Srpska\nThe Army of Republika Srpska (); Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian Vojska Republike Srpske (VRS)), also referred to as the Bosnian Serb Army, was the military of the Republika Srpska, an area which was previously the \"Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\", a self-proclaimed state within the internationally recognized territory of the sovereign Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn 2003 the army began to integrate into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2005 a fully integrated unit of Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats was deployed to augment the US-led coalition forces in Iraq. On 6 June 2006, it was fully integrated into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  \n\nHistory \n\nThe Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) was founded on 12 May 1992 from the remnants of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from which Bosnia and Herzegovina had seceded the same year. When the Bosnian War erupted, the JNA formally discharged 80,000 Bosnian Serb troops. These troops, who were allowed to keep their heavy weapons, formed the backbone of the newly formed Army of the Republika Srpska.  Aside from being made up almost entirely of Serb Orthodox officers and recruits from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the VRS also utilized the services of approximately 4,000 foreign Orthodox Christian volunteers to participate in combat operations during the Bosnian War. 1,000-1,500 of these came from Russia, and Bulgaria,  with 700 volunteers originating from Russia specifically.  100 Greeks also volunteered to fight on the side of the Bosnian Serbs, forming the Greek Volunteer Guard which allegedly participated in the Srebrenica massacre. \n\nThe military leader of the VRS was General Ratko Mladi\u0107, who is now indicted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for genocide, as are other high-ranking Serb officers.  Mladi\u0107 was arrested in Serbia on 26 May 2011.\n\nSpecial units \n\n* Panthers Guard Special Brigade (), East-Bosnian Corps \n* Wolves from the Drina, or Drina Wolves (), Drina Corps\n* Special Unit \"MANDO\" (), East-Bosnian Corps\n* Special Unit \"OSMACI\" (), Drina Corps\n* Serb Guard Ilid\u017ea (), Sarajevo-Romanija Corps\n* White Wolves ()\n\nOrganization \n\n1993 \n\n* 1st Krajina Corps \u2013 Banja Luka\n* 2nd Krajina Corps \u2013 Drvar\n* 3rd Corps \u2013 Bijeljina\n* East Bosnia Corps \u2013 Han Pijesak\n* Herzegovina Corps \u2013 Bile\u0107a\n\n1995 \n\n* 1st Krajina Corps \u2013 Banja Luka\n* 2nd Krajina Corps \u2013 Drvar\n* East Bosnia Corps \u2013 Bijeljina\n* Sarajevo-Romanija Corps \u2013 Pale\n* Drina Corps \u2013 Han Pijesak\n* Herzegovina Corps \u2013 Bile\u0107a\n\n2001 \n\n* 1st Corps \u2013 Banja Luka\n* 3rd Corps \u2013 Bijeljina\n* 5th Corps \u2013 Sokolac\n* 7th Corps \u2013 Bile\u0107a\n\nEquipment \n\nTanks and armoured vehicles \n\n* M-84\n* T-55\n* T-34\n* BVP M-80\n* OT M-60\n* BTR-50\n* BOV\n\nTowed artillery \n\n* M-56\n* D-30\n* M-30\n* M-46\n* D-20\n* M-84\n* M-1\n* ZiS-3\n\nSelf-propelled artillery \n\n* 2S1 Gvozdika\n\nMLRS \n\n* M-63 Plamen\n* M-77 Oganj\n* M-87 Orkan\n\nATGW \n\n* AT-3 and AT-5\n\nAntitank guns \n\n* T-12\n\nAnti-aircraft guns \n\n* ZSU-57-2\n* M53/59 Praga\n* BOV-3\n* ZU-23-2\n\nMANPADs and SAMs \n\n* SA-7\n* SA-18\n* SA-6\n* SA-9\n\nInfantry weapons \n\n* Zastava M70\n* Zastava M72\n* Zastava M84\n* Zastava M76\n* Heckler & Koch MP5\n* M79 Rocket Launcher\n* M80 Zolja\n\nRepublika Srpska Air Force \n\nFormerly known as Ratno Vazduhoplovstva i Protiv Vazdu\u0161na Odbrana Vojska Republike Srpske or RV i PVO RS.

Following a lengthy 10 year court case, Lagos State government offered other parcels of land as consideration for the Maroko development.\n\nMany scoffed at Chief Adeleke's decision to select the Ikoyi Island perimeter, however they were unable to appreciate the foresight of the Chief, who promptly engaged the Westminster Dredging Company to dredge the foreshore, and create six interlinked and symmetrical islands.\n\nHe wanted to create a development that would \"Make Nigeria Proud\", and engaged Minoru Yamasaki the architect of Manhattan's Twin Towers, to design replica twin towers as the flagship iconic buildings on the main island.\n\nTo complete the Lagoon City concept, Chief Adeleke planned an aesthetic design including a City Airport, which was a vision conceived long before the London Docklands Development, London City Airport, Dubai's Palm Islands or Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport.\n\nUnfortunately for the Chief, as soon as he had reclaimed the land and the brilliance of the idea was unveiled, others were determined to wrestle the land from him, and the project was 'acquired' again with no consideration being paid to City Property Development Limited. The 'acquisition' is currently being challenged in various courts, and there are Caveat Emptor warnings in place to warn prospective buyers that their investment could be at risk in future. There is also litigation pending in the UK and European courts regarding this matter.\n\nThe subsequent developers were principally interested in maximising the yield of the land at the expense of the aesthetic innovative design foreseen by Chief Adebayo Adeleke. Consequently, the land was filled in to create a banana shaped island, which has resolutely failed to achieve any international iconic architectural acclaim, as it is now a residential scheme rather than the commercial development originally envisaged.\n\nBanana Island, is an area of Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, 8.6 kilometres east of Tafawa Balewa Square. Part of the Lagos Local Government Area of Eti-Osa in Central Lagos, it is known for its wealthy, multi-cultural community and has some of the most expensive real estate in Nigeria.  Banana Island has one of the highest density of millionaires within its boundaries. \n\nDesign\n\nBanana Island is a man-made island in Lagos State, Nigeria that is slightly curved in shape \u2013 like a banana.  It is located in the Lagos Lagoon and is connected to Ikoyi Island by a dedicated road which is linked to the existing road network near Parkview Estate.  The island was constructed by the Lebanese-Nigerian Chagoury Group in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing    and is considered to be on par with the Seventh Arrondissement in Paris, La Jolla in San Diego, and Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya and Roppongi neighbourhoods.\n\nIt occupies a sand-filled area of approximately 1,630,000 square metres and is divided into 536 plots (of between 1000 and 4000 square metres in size) mainly arranged along cul-de-sacs, so designed to enhance the historically residential nature of Ikoyi. Residents are provided with world class utilities including underground electrical systems (versus the overhead cabling common throughout Lagos), an underground water supply network, a central sewage system and treatment plant, and street lighting and satellite telecommunications networks. \n\nThe Island is a planned, mixed development with dedicated areas for residential, commercial and recreational activities.  On the residential side of the Island, planning permission is not granted for dwellings over 3 storeys high. The developers also intend to develop a main piazza, a club-house, a primary and secondary school, a fire and police station and a medical clinic. They are also negotiating to build a 5-star hotel on the island, along with an array of smaller Guest Houses.\n\nComposition\n\nBanana Island hosts several high end residential developments such as Ocean Parade Towers   - a series of 14 luxury tower blocks strategically situated at one end of the island to take advantage of 180 degree panoramic views overlooking the lagoon. Similar to many of the developments on the island, it has dedicated leisure facilities such as a private health club - with tennis courts, squash courts and a swimming pool surrounded by extensive gardens.   At launch flats in Ocean Parade sold for over US$400,000. \n\nSeveral leading Nigerian and International corporates such as - Etisalat Nigeria,  Airtel Nigeria,  Ford Foundation Nigeria  and Olaniwun Ajayi & Co  - are also based on Banana Island.\n\nNotable residents\n\n*Mike Adenuga - Billionaire owner of Globacom - Nigeria\u2019s second-largest telecom operator and oil exploration firm Conoil. \n*Iyabo Obasanjo - Daughter of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Oluremi Obasanjo, Elected to the Nigerian Senate representing Ogun Central Senatorial District of Ogun State,  Senior Fellow at Harvard's Advanced Leadership Initiative.\n*Saayu Dantata - Son of Alhassan Dantata - the wealthiest man in West Africa at the time of his death in 1955.\n*Kola Abiola - son of MKO Abiola - prominent businessman, publisher and politician.

It is the seat of the administration of the district of Dili, which is the administrative entity of the area and includes the island of Atauro and some cities close to Dili city. The city is divided into the subdistricts of Nain Feto, Vera Cruz, Dom Aleixo and Cristo Rei and is divided into several sucos, which are headed by an elected chefe de suco. 18 of the 26 sucos of the four subdistricts are categorised as urban. \n\nThere is no city administration beside the district administrator, who was appointed by state government. The East Timorese government started to plan in 2009 to change the status of districts into municipalities. These will have an elected mayor and council. \n\nDemography\n\nThe 2010 census recorded a population of 193,563 in the areas of Dili district classified as urban, with a population of 234,331 in the whole district including rural areas such as Atauro and Metinaro.\n\nDili is a melting pot of the different ethnic groups of East Timor, due partly to the internal migration of young men from around the country in search of work.  This has led to a gender imbalance, with the male population significantly larger than the female.  Between 2001 and 2004, the population of Dili district grew by 12.58%, with only 54% of the district's inhabitants born in the city.  7% were born in Bacau, 5% each in Viqueque and Bobonaro  4% in Ermera, and the remainder in other districts or overseas. \n\nClimate\n\nDili has a Tropical wet and dry climate under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification.\n\nHistory\n\nDili was settled about 1520 by the Portuguese, who made it the capital of Portuguese Timor in 1769.  It was proclaimed a city in January 1864. During World War II, Portugal and its colonies remained neutral, but the Allies saw East Timor as a potential target for Japanese invasion, and Australian and Dutch forces briefly occupied the island in 1941.  In the night of 19 February 1942, the Japanese attacked with a force of around 20,000 men, and occupied Dili before spreading out across the rest of the colony.  On 26 September 1945, control of the island was officially returned to Portugal by the Japanese.\n\nEast Timor unilaterally declared independence from Portugal on 28 November 1975. However, nine days later, on 7 December, Indonesian forces invaded Dili. On 17 July 1976, Indonesia annexed East Timor, which it designated the 27th province of Indonesia, Timor Timur (Indonesian for East Timor), with Dili as its capital. A guerrilla war ensued from 1975 to 1999 between Indonesian and pro-independence forces, during which tens of thousands of East Timorese and some foreign civilians were killed. Media coverage of the 1991 Dili Massacre helped revitalise international support for the East Timorese independence movement.\n\nIn 1999, East Timor was placed under UN supervision and on 20 May 2002, Dili became the capital of the newly independent Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. In May 2006, fighting and rioting sparked by conflict between elements of the military caused significant damage to the city and led to foreign military intervention to restore order.\n\nBuildings and monuments\n\nMost buildings were damaged or destroyed in the violence of 1999, orchestrated by the Indonesian military and local pro-Indonesia militias (see Operation Scorched Earth).  However, the city still has many buildings from the Portuguese era. The former Portuguese Governor's office is now the office of the Prime Minister. It was previously also used by the Indonesian-appointed Governor, and by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).\n\nEven under Indonesian rule, during which the Portuguese language was banned, Portuguese street names like Avenida Marechal Carmona remained unchanged, although they were prefixed with the Indonesian word Jalan or 'road'. The Roman Catholic Church at Motael became a focus for resistance to Indonesian occupation. Legacies of Jakarta's occupation are the Church of the Immaculate Conception, seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of D\u00edli, purportedly the largest cathedral in Southeast Asia, and the 'Integration Monument', commemorating the Indonesian annexation of the territory in 1976. Featuring a statue of an East Timorese in traditional dress, breaking the chains round his wrists, the monument has not been demolished.\n\nThe Cristo Rei of Dili is a 27-metre (88.6\u00a0ft) tall statue of Jesus situated on top of a globe at the end of a peninsula in Dili. It is one of the town's landmarks.  It was a present from the Indonesian Government during occupation for the 20th anniversary of East Timor's integration into Indonesia.\n\nEducation\n\nSchools in Dili include St. Joseph\u2019s High School (Col\u00e9gio de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9).\nThere are four International schools in Dili, a Portuguese school by the name of Escola Portuguesa Ruy Cinatti, an Australian managed school by the name of Dili International School, an American government sponsored school called QSI International School of Dili and the Maharlika International School (Formerly Dili Education & Development Center), a Philippine International School.  East Timor's major higher education institution, the Universidade Nacional de Timor-Leste, is based in Dili.\n\nTransportation\n\nDili is served by Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport, named after independence leader Nicolau Lobato.  This is the only functioning international airport in East Timor, though there are airstrips in Baucau, Suai and Oecusse used for domestic flights.  Until recently, Dili's airport runway has been unable to accommodate aircraft larger than the Boeing 737 or C-130 Hercules, but in January 2008, the Portuguese charter airline EuroAtlantic Airways operated a direct flight from Lisbon using a Boeing 757, carrying 140 members of the Guarda Nacional Republicana. \n\nUnder Portuguese rule, Baucau Airport, which has a much longer runway, was used for international flights, but following the Indonesian invasion this was taken over by the Indonesian military and closed to civilian traffic.\n\nTwin towns \u2013 Sister cities\n\nDili is twinned with the following places:\nQuestion:\nDili is the capital of which country?\nAnswer:\nOperation STABILISE\nPassage:\nFrances Tomelty\nFrances Tomelty (born 6 Oct 1948) is a Northern Irish actress.\n\nCareer\n\nTomelty was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the daughter of actor Joseph Tomelty (5 March 1911 \u2013 7 June 1995). She has featured in series including Bergerac, Inspector Morse, Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, Strangers, Midsomer Murders and Coronation Street, Cracker, as well as many films including Bellman and True, Monk Dawson, Bullshot and The Field. She was Lady Macbeth in the Old Vic's disastrous 1980 production of Macbeth, with Peter O'Toole in the title role. \n\nTomelty's roles in recent years include the drama series Spooks, Casualty, The Amazing Mrs Pritchard, Holby City, Law & Order: UK, The Royal, Waking the Dead, Silent Witness,  Unforgotten as well as big-budget adaptations Atlantis, Merlin, The White Queen, and A Perfect Spy, and the film Ch\u00e9ri.\n\nPersonal life\n\nOn 1 May 1976, Tomelty married musician Gordon \"Sting\" Sumner \u2013 best known as the lead singer and bassist for the rock band The Police \u2013 after knowing him for two years. They met on the set of a rock-musical called Rock Nativity.  She played the Virgin Mary; he played in the band. They have two children together, Joseph (born 23 November 1976) and Fuchsia Katherine (\"Kate\") (born 17 April 1982). Sumner left Tomelty for his current wife Trudie Styler, and the couple divorced in 1984. The split was controversial; as The Independent reported in 2006, \"The problem was, he was already married \u2013 to actress Frances Tomelty, who just happened to be Trudie's best friend (Sting and Frances lived next door to Trudie in Bayswater, west London, for several years before the two of them became lovers). The affair was widely condemned \u2013 not least because it coincided with the break-up of the Police.\"\nQuestion:\nWhich music star married Frances Tomelty in 1976?\nAnswer:\nSting (pain)\nPassage:\nJoey Buttafuoco\nJoseph A. \"Joey\" Buttafuoco (born March 11, 1956) is an auto body shop owner from Long Island. He is best known for having had an affair with Amy Fisher. Fisher, who was 17 years old at the time, subsequently shot Buttafuoco's wife, Mary Jo Buttafuoco, in the face. Popular news coverage titled Fisher the \"Long Island Lolita.\"  Buttafuoco subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape and served four months in jail. \n\nShooting incident\n\nOn May 19, 1992, Amy Fisher shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco in the right side of the face. Fisher had come to the Buttafuocos' house to confront Mary Jo Buttafuoco about Joey Buttafuoco, with whom she had been having an affair since July 1991 after Fisher brought her vehicle to Buttafuoco's auto body shop in Baldwin, Nassau County. When Mary Jo answered the door, Fisher\u2014posing as her own (fictitious) sister Ann Marie\u2014offered as proof of the affair a T-shirt that Joey had given her, with the logo of his auto body shop on it. The front porch confrontation escalated, and when Mary Jo demanded that Fisher leave and turned to go into the house and call Joey, Fisher shot her in the face with a .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol. Once Mary Jo regained consciousness, she identified Fisher as her assailant.\n\nThe investigation of the shooting and the subsequent court cases involved a series of conflicting claims, and received significant news coverage in both mainstream news outlets and tabloids.  Buttafuoco's lawyer maintained that Buttafuoco was never involved with Fisher and Fisher had invented the affair, while Fisher's lawyer portrayed Fisher as a victim whom Buttafuoco manipulated into the shooting. \n\nAfter Fisher's assault conviction, Buttafuoco was indicted on 19 counts of statutory rape, sodomy, and endangering the welfare of a child. He initially pleaded not guilty.  He later changed his plea to guilty, admitting he had sex with Fisher when she was 16 and that he had known her age at the time.   He was sentenced to six months' jail time, and was released after serving four months and nine days of the sentence. \n\nAfter his release from prison, Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuoco moved to California, where Mary Jo filed divorce papers in Ventura County Superior Court on February 3, 2003. \n\nUnrelated charges\n\nButtafuoco has been charged with crimes on several occasions since the 1992 shooting incident.\n\n* In 1995, he pleaded no contest to a solicitation of prostitution charge and was fined and placed on probation for two years. \n* In 2004, he was sentenced to a year in jail and five years of probation after pleading guilty to auto insurance fraud. As part of the sentence, he is prohibited from working in the auto body industry in California for the rest of his life. \n* In August 2005, he was charged with illegal possession of ammunition. As a convicted felon, he is legally not permitted to own ammunition. Probation officers found the ammunition during a search of his home. He pleaded no contest and began serving his sentence on January 8, 2007.  He was released on April 28, 2007.\n\nMedia appearances\n\nThe significant coverage of the shooting incident made Buttafuoco a minor celebrity. During Fisher's trial, Buttafuoco appeared frequently on mainstream and tabloid news programs and talk shows, and gave multiple interviews to all forms of media. David Letterman, in his last year of hosting Late Night with David Letterman, discussed the incident so often that Buttafuoco's name was a recurring punchline,  while Saturday Night Live parodied the case in multiple sketches. \n\nIn 2002, Buttafuoco participated in the Fox Network's Celebrity Boxing, originally slated to oppose John Wayne Bobbitt, who dropped out due to being arrested for domestic abuse. Bobbitt was replaced by female pro wrestler Joanie \"Chyna\" Laurer.  Buttafuoco, despite being booed, won the fight in a majority decision (29\u201328, 29\u201327, 28\u201328).\n\nIn 2006, he and Amy Fisher were reunited at the Lingerie Bowl for the coin toss.   In a story reported in the New York Post, reality show producer David Krieff suggested that Buttafuoco and Fisher were then \"dating\" again, although this was not supported by any direct statements from either Buttafuoco or Fisher.  On May 23, 2007, Mary Jo Buttafuocco appeared on CNN's Larry King Live program to discuss the recent reunion of her ex-husband and the former \"Long Island Lolita.\" At the time, Buttafuoco's second wife, Evanka, had recently filed for divorce, but withdrew her divorce petition on June 22, 2007. \n\nButtafuoco appeared on the Judge Jeanine Pirro show on March 5, 2009. He sued a woman who had attempted to pay for $4,700 in repairs to her Corvette in sexual favors rather than money. Buttafuoco won the case.\n\nIn 2012, Buttafuoco appeared on the Fox News program Justice with Judge Jeanine, offering commentary on a murder-for-hire plot.\n\nButtafuoco appeared on Judge Alex on November 1, 2012. He sued his friend Rob Spallone's company over a dispute regarding the rental of a frozen ice truck for Buttafuoco's nephew's birthday party. Buttafuoco won the case and Spallone was ordered to pay $4,400 in damages.\n\nTV and film career\n\nButtafuoco made his film debut as a cab driver in Cul-de-Sac (video title: Better Than Ever).

Following the death of Pamela Cundell in 2015, he and Ian Lavender are the last surviving major cast members. He reprised the role of Farthing in the 2016 film adaptation of the series. \n\nBiography\n\nBorn in London, Williams was educated at Ardingly College, West Sussex and Hendon School (then Hendon County School). He appeared regularly in the TV series The Army Game (1957\u201360) as Captain Pocket. His film roles include Norman Wisdom films: The Square Peg (1958), The Bulldog Breed (1960), and A Stitch In Time (1963). He had a leading role in the BBC TV series Diary of a Young Man (1964), which was partly directed by Ken Loach, in addition to small parts in numerous popular TV series of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIt is however for his role in Dad's Army   as Timothy Farthing, that Williams is best known. Coincidentally, while at Hendon County, he had played the lead in the school play of his final year, The Ghost Train, written nearly 30 years earlier by Arnold Ridley, who would become one of his fellow actors in Dad's Army.\n\nIn 1970, he starred with Tessie O'Shea in the short-lived sitcom As Good Cooks Go. In 1967 and again in 1971, Williams appeared in an episode of All Gas and Gaiters as one of the vicars choral. In 1972, at the height of his Dad's Army fame, he had a cameo role in Monty Python's Flying Circus. He also had an occasional role as a Bishop in You Rang, M'Lord?.\n\nHe lived for many years in Edgware, Middlesex. Until 2000, he was a lay member of the General Synod of the Church of England. Williams was a guest on This Morning on Thursday 31 July 2008, talking about Dad's Army with fellow cast members, Ian Lavender and Bill Pertwee. He also appeared on BBC1's Jonathan Ross Salutes Dad's Army show on Sunday 3 August 2008.  \n\nHe is the author of several plays, including The Playing Fields and Murder Weekend, some of which have been performed in the pro-amateur theatre.\n\nHis autobiography, Vicar to Dad's Army: the Frank Williams story, was published in 2002.\n\nWith other surviving members of the Dad's Army cast he walked in the 100th Birthday parade for Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, whose favourite programme it had been.\n\nWilliams is the patron of Veneratio, a charity established to counter the social isolation of the elderly.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the vicar in \u2018Dad\u2019s Army\u2019?\nAnswer:\nWarden Hodges\nPassage:\nEurasian hobby\nThe Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), or just simply hobby, is a small slim falcon. It belongs to a rather close-knit group of similar falcons often considered a subgenus Hypotriorchis.\n\nDescription\n\nAdults are slate-grey above with a dark crown and two short black moustachial stripes. The throat is unstreaked white, thighs and undertail coverts are unstreaked rufous and rest of the underparts are whitish with black streaks. Close views enable the red \"trousers\" and vent to be seen. Sexes are similar. Juveniles are generally much browner, with scaled upper parts and streaked buffy thighs and undertail coverts.\n\nThe hobby has a distinct first-summer plumage.\n\nThis falcon is  in length with a wingspan of 74 \u2013 and a weight of 175 \u2013.\n\nFile:Falco subbuteo from Kadzidlowo.jpg|Falco subbuteo from Kadzidlowo\nFile:Kobuz (Falco subbuteo).jpg|Juvenile Falco subbuteo portrait\nFile:Falco subbuteo kobuz1.jpg|In flight\n\nTaxonomy and systematics\n\nThis species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Falco subbuteo.\n\nCurrently two subspecies are recognized:\n\n* F. s. subbuteo: the nominate race is resident in Africa, Europe and Central and East Asia, winters in Central and South Africa and South Asia\n* F. s. streichi: described by Hartert and Neumann in 1907, is smaller in size and is found further east of F. s. subbuteos distribution range\n\nThe genus name falco derives from Late Latin falx, falcis, a sickle, referring to the claws of the bird. The species name subbuteo is from Latin sub, \"near to\" and buteo, \" buzzard\" . The species' English name comes from Old French hob\u00e9 or hobet. It became the trademark for the Subbuteo games company after its creator was refused permission to register \"Hobby\". \n\nDistribution and status\n\nThis species breeds across Africa, Europe and Asia. It is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa and Asia.\n\nBehaviour and ecology\n\nIt is a bird of open country such as farmland, marshes, taiga and savannah. They are widespread in lowlands with scattered small woods. It is an elegant bird of prey, appearing sickle-like in flight with its long pointed wings and square tail, often resembling a swift when gliding with folded wings. It flies powerfully and fast. It will take large insects, such as dragonflies, which it transfers from talons to beak and eats while soaring slowly in circles. It also captures small bats  and small birds like swallows, swifts, pipits etc. in flight. Its speed and aerobatic skills enable it to take swallows and even swifts on the wing, and barn swallows or house martins have a characteristic \"hobby\" alarm call. It is known to harass swallows while they are roosting and dispersing from roosts. When not breeding, it is crepuscular, hawking principally in the mornings and evenings. While on migration, they may move in small groups.\n\nHobbies nest in old nests of crows and other birds. The tree selected is most often one in a hedge or on the extreme edge of a spinney, whence the bird can observe intruders from a considerable distance. It lays 2\u20134 eggs. Incubation is said to take 28 days and both parents share in this duty, though the female does the greater part.\n\nIt is a very bold and courageous bird and was used in falconry, trained to hawk birds like quails, larks, hoopoes, drongos, etc.\nQuestion:\nFalco subbuteo is the scientific name for which small falcon?\nAnswer:\nHOBBY\n", "answers": ["The End.", "The End (television)", "The End (book)", "The End", "The End (disambiguation)", "The END", "The End (album)", "The End(album)", "The End (Single)", "The End (band)", "The End (film)", "The End (song)", "The end"], "pred": "Fine''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''", "length": 7081, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b7fa31fa1320f5bbf5a51575708f2772053aa30fb3401bb9"}

Kennedy Sr. Ambassador to Britain\nLate in 1937, Mr. Kennedy was appointed United States Ambassador to England and moved there with his whole family, with the exception of Joe and Jack who were at Harvard.\nBecause of his father\u2019s job, Jack became very interested in European politics and world affairs. After a summer visit to England and other countries in Europe, Jack returned to Harvard more eager to learn about history and government and to keep up with current events.\nSource: JFK Bio Added by: Rob Brent\nIn 1938, Roosevelt appointed Kennedy as the United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James (Britain). Kennedy's Irish and Catholic status did not bother the British; indeed he hugely enjoyed his leadership position in London society, which stood in stark contrast to his outsider status in Boston. His daughter Kathleen married the heir to the Duke of Devonshire, the head of one of England's grandest aristocratic families. Kennedy rejected the warnings of Winston Churchill that compromise with Nazi Germany was impossible; instead he supported Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement in order to stave off a second world war that would be a more horrible \"armageddon\" than the first. Throughout 1938, as the Nazi persecution of Jews intensified, Kennedy attempted to obtain an audience with Adolf Hitler. Shortly before the Nazi aerial bombing of British cities began in September 1940, Kennedy sought a personal meeting with Hitler, again without State Department approval, \"to bring about a better understanding between the United States and Germany.\"\nKennedy argued strongly against giving aid to Britain.\n\"Democracy is finished in England. It may be here,\" stated Ambassador Kennedy in the Boston Sunday Globe of November 10, 1940. In that one simple statement, Joe Kennedy ruined any future chances of becoming US president, effectively committing political suicide. While bombs fell daily on the UK, Nazi troops occupied Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, Ambassador Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated his belief that the war was not about saving democracy from National Socialism (Nazism) or Fascism. In the now-infamous, long, rambling interview with two newspaper journalists, Louis M. Lyons of the Boston Globe and Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Kennedy opined:\n\"It's all a question of what we do with the next six months. The whole reason for aiding England is to give us time.\" ... \"As long as she is in there, we have time to prepare. It isn't that [Britain is] fighting for democracy. That's the bunk. She's fighting for self-preservation, just as we will if it comes to us... I know more about the European situation than anybody else, and it's up to me to see that the country gets it,\"\nIn British government circles during the Blitz, Ambassador Kennedy was widely disparaged as a defeatist.\nWhen the American public and Roosevelt Administration officials read his quotes on democracy being \"finished\", and his belief that the Battle of Britain wasn't about \"fighting for democracy,\" all of it being just \"bunk\", they realized that Ambassador Kennedy could not be trusted to represent the United States. In the face of national public outcry, he submitted his resignation later that month.\nThroughout the rest of the war, relations between Kennedy and the Roosevelt Administration remained tense (especially when Joe Kennedy, Jr., vocally opposed FDR's renomination). Having effectively removed himself from the national stage, Joe Sr. sat out the war on the sidelines. Kennedy did however stay active in the smaller venues of rallying Irish and Roman Catholic Democrats to vote for Roosevelt's reelection in 1944. He claimed to be eager to help the war effort, but as a result of his previous gaffes, he was neither trusted nor re-invited.\nWith his own ambitions for the White House in self-inflicted ruins, he held out great hope for his eldest son, Joseph Jr., to gain the presidency. However, Joe Jr. was killed over England while undertaking a high-risk bombing mission in 1944. Kennedy then turned his attention to grooming the second son, John F. Kennedy, who won the 1960 election.\nSource: Wikipedia Added by: Rob Brent\nMore information\nQuestion:\nJohn F Kennedy's father Joe was US ambassador to which country?\nAnswer:\nBritian\nPassage:\nMark Dolan\nMark Dolan (born 17 March 1974) is an English comedian, writer, and television presenter.\n\nEarly life\n\nDolan was born in Camden, London.

It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4.  The \"four-minute barrier\" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds.  Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour (24.14\u00a0km/h, or 2:29.13 per kilometre, or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres).\n\nRecord holders\n\nBreaking the four-minute barrier was first achieved on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University's Iffley Road Track, by Englishman Roger Bannister,  with the help of fellow-runners as pacemakers.    Two months later, during the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games hosted in Vancouver, B.C., two competing runners, Australia's John Landy and Bannister, ran the distance of one mile in under four minutes. The race's end is memorialised in a statue of the two (with Landy glancing over his shoulder, thus losing the race) placed in front of the Pacific National Exhibition entrance plaza.\n\nNew Zealand's John Walker, the first man to run the mile under 3:50, managed to run 135 sub-four-minute miles during his career (during which he was the first person to run over 100 sub-four-minute miles), and American Steve Scott has run the most sub-four-minute miles, with 136. Algeria's Noureddine Morceli was the first under 3:45.  Currently, the mile record is held by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who ran a time of 3:43.13 in Rome in 1999.\n\nIn 1964, America's Jim Ryun became the first high-school runner to break four minutes for the mile, running 3:59.0 as a junior and a then American record 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965.  Tim Danielson (1966) and Marty Liquori (1967) also came in under four minutes, but Ryun's high-school record stood until Alan Webb ran 3:53.43 in 2001.  Ten years later, in 2011, Lukas Verzbicas became the fifth high-schooler under four minutes.   In 2015, Matthew Maton and Grant Fisher became the sixth and seventh high-schoolers to break four minutes, both running 3:59.38 about a month apart.   Webb was the first high schooler to run sub-4 indoors, running 3:59.86 in early 2001.  On February 6, 2016, Andrew Hunter significantly improved upon Webb's mark, running 3:58.25 on the same New York Armory track  and 3:57.81 two weeks later.   Hunter achieved the 4 minute mile mark outdoors later in the season at the Prefontaine Classic.  At that same meet Michael Slagowski joined the list of high school athletes under 4 minutes. \n\nAnother illustration of the progression of performance in the men's mile is that, in 1994, forty years after Bannister's breaking of the barrier, the Irish runner Eamonn Coghlan became the first man over the age of 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile.  Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records, World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute-mile performance as a record in the M40 division. Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark. Over 18 years after Coghlan, that was finally achieved by UK's Anthony Whiteman, running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012. \n\nNo woman has yet run a four-minute mile. , the women's world record is held by retired Russian Svetlana Masterkova, with a time of 4:12.56 in 1996. \n\nIn 1997, Daniel Komen of Kenya ran two miles in less than eight minutes, doubling up on Bannister's accomplishment.   He did it again in February 1998, falling just .3 behind his previous performance, still the only individual to accomplish the feat. \n\nPossible other claims \n\nJames Parrott\n\nSome sources (including Olympic medalist Peter Radford ) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run in London by James Parrott on 9 May 1770.   Parrott's route began on Goswell Road, before turning down Old Street, finishing at St Leonard's, Shoreditch. Although timing methods at this time were \u2013 following the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison \u2013 accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies.  Neal Bascomb notes in The Perfect Mile that \"even nineteenth-century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account.\" \n\nGlenn Cunningham\n\nIt is also reputed that Glenn Cunningham achieved a four-minute mile in a workout in the 1920s. In addition to being unsubstantiated, a workout run would not count as a record. \n\nPopular culture\n\nIn 1988, the ABC and the BBC co-produced The Four Minute Mile, a miniseries dramatisation of the race to the four-minute mile, featuring Richard Huw as Bannister and Nique Needles as John Landy (who was simultaneously pursuing the milestone). It was written by David Williamson and directed by Jim Goddard.\n\nIn 2004, Neal Bascomb wrote a book entitled The Perfect Mile about Roger Bannister, John Landy, and Wes Santee portraying their individual attempts to break the four-minute mile and the context of the sport of mile racing. A second film version (entitled Four Minutes) was made in 2005, starring Jamie Maclachlan as Bannister.\n\nIn June 2011 the watch used to time the original event was donated by Jeffrey Archer to a charity auction for Oxford University Athletics Club and sold for \u00a397,250. \n\nIn July 2016 the BBC released a documentary with firsthand interviews from Bannister and various other figures on the first sub-4 minute mile.\nQuestion:\nWho is popularly recognised as being the first person to run a mile in under 4 minutes?\nAnswer:\n3 minute mile\nPassage:\nGPO Film Unit\nThe GPO Film Unit was a subdivision of the UK General Post Office. The unit was established in 1933, taking on responsibilities of the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit. Headed by John Grierson,  it was set up to produce sponsored documentary films mainly related to the activities of the GPO.\n\nAmong the films it produced were Harry Watt's and Basil Wright's Night Mail (1936), featuring music by Benjamin Britten and poetry by W. H. Auden, which is the best known. Directors who worked for the unit included Humphrey Jennings, Alberto Cavalcanti, Paul Rotha, Harry Watt, Basil Wright and a young Norman McLaren. Poet and memoirist Laurie Lee also worked as a scriptwriter in the unit from 1939-1940.\n\nIn 1940 the GPO Film Unit became the Crown Film Unit, under the control of the Ministry of Information.\n\nIn Autumn 2008 the British Film Institute issued a first collection of selected films from the Unit. Titled Addressing The Nation, it comprises fifteen titles from the years 1933 to 1935, including Song of Ceylon. A second volume, We Live In Two Worlds was released in February 2009, with 22 films covering the period 1936 to 1938, and includes Night Mail. A third (and final) volume, If War Should Come, appeared in July 2009 and includes London Can Take It!\n\nFilmography\nQuestion:\nWhich composer (1913 to 1976) wrote the music used in the 1936 GPO film 'Night Mail'?\nAnswer:\nBritten, Benjamin\nPassage:\nMarmolada\nMarmolada (Ladin: Marmoleda) is a mountain in northeastern Italy  and the highest mountain of the Dolomites (a section of the Alps). It lies between the borders of Trentino and Veneto.\n\nGeography\n\nThe mountain is located about 100 kilometres north-northwest of Venice, from which it can be seen on a clear day. It consists of a ridge running west to east. Towards the south it breaks suddenly into sheer cliffs, forming a rock face several kilometres long. On the north side there is a comparatively flat glacier, the only large glacier in the Dolomites (the Marmolada Glacier, Ghiacciaio della Marmolada).\n\nThe ridge is composed of several summits, decreasing in altitude from west to east: Punta Penia (3,343 m), Punta Rocca (3,309 m), Punta Ombretta (3,230 m), Monte Serauta (3,069 m), and Pizzo Serauta (3,035 m). An aerial tramway goes to the top of Punta Rocca. During the ski season the Marmolada's main ski run is opened for skiers and snowboarders alike, making it possible to ski down into the valley.\n\nHistory\n\nPaul Grohmann made the first ascent in 1864, along the north route. The south face was climbed for the first time in 1901 by Beatrice Tomasson, Michele Bettega and Bartolo Zagonel.\n\nUntil the end of World War I the border between Austria-Hungary and Italy ran over Marmolada, so it formed part of the front line during that conflict. Austro-Hungarian soldiers were quartered in deep tunnels bored into the northern face's glacier, and Italian soldiers were quartered on the south face's rocky precipices.  As glaciers retreat, soldiers' remains and belongings are occasionally discovered.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Marmolada_Sunset.jpg|Sunset\nFile:Marmolada_Massif.JPG\nFile:Canazei.jpg|Marmolada from Canazei\nQuestion:\nMonte Marmolada is the highest peak in which mountain range?\nAnswer:\nDolomite Alps\n\n\nPassage:\nNadine Coyle - Biography - IMDb\nNadine Coyle - Biography - IMDb\nNadine Coyle\nJump to: Overview \u00a0(4)\u00a0| Mini Bio \u00a0(1)\u00a0| Trade Mark \u00a0(2)\u00a0| Trivia \u00a0(9)\nOverview (4)\n5'\u00a05\"\u00a0(1.65\u00a0m)\nMini Bio (1)\nNadine Coyle was born on June 15, 1985 in Derry, Northern Ireland as Nadine Elizabeth Louise Coyle.\nTrade Mark (2)\nShe was the third girl to make it into Girls Aloud .\nRanked #35 in FHM 100 Sexiest Women 2005.\nMember of the all girl pop group Girls Aloud from the UK.\nSupporter of Glasgow Celtic Football Club.\nHas won two series of Pop Idol (2001), the first was in Ireland but she was disqualified when the producers found out she was under the minimum age.\nLives in the US.\nTouring the world, and releasing a single with Girls Aloud in March 2006.

While bombs fell daily on the UK, Nazi troops occupied Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, Ambassador Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated his belief that the war was not about saving democracy from National Socialism (Nazism) or Fascism. In the now-infamous, long, rambling interview with two newspaper journalists, Louis M. Lyons of the Boston Globe and Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Kennedy opined:\n\"It's all a question of what we do with the next six months. The whole reason for aiding England is to give us time.\" ... \"As long as she is in there, we have time to prepare. It isn't that [Britain is] fighting for democracy. That's the bunk. She's fighting for self-preservation, just as we will if it comes to us... I know more about the European situation than anybody else, and it's up to me to see that the country gets it,\"\nIn British government circles during the Blitz, Ambassador Kennedy was widely disparaged as a defeatist.\nWhen the American public and Roosevelt Administration officials read his quotes on democracy being \"finished\", and his belief that the Battle of Britain wasn't about \"fighting for democracy,\" all of it being just \"bunk\", they realized that Ambassador Kennedy could not be trusted to represent the United States. In the face of national public outcry, he submitted his resignation later that month.\nThroughout the rest of the war, relations between Kennedy and the Roosevelt Administration remained tense (especially when Joe Kennedy, Jr., vocally opposed FDR's renomination). Having effectively removed himself from the national stage, Joe Sr. sat out the war on the sidelines. Kennedy did however stay active in the smaller venues of rallying Irish and Roman Catholic Democrats to vote for Roosevelt's reelection in 1944. He claimed to be eager to help the war effort, but as a result of his previous gaffes, he was neither trusted nor re-invited.\nWith his own ambitions for the White House in self-inflicted ruins, he held out great hope for his eldest son, Joseph Jr., to gain the presidency. However, Joe Jr. was killed over England while undertaking a high-risk bombing mission in 1944. Kennedy then turned his attention to grooming the second son, John F. Kennedy, who won the 1960 election.\nSource: Wikipedia Added by: Rob Brent\nMore information\nQuestion:\nJohn F Kennedy's father Joe was US ambassador to which country?\nAnswer:\nBritian\nPassage:\nMark Dolan\nMark Dolan (born 17 March 1974) is an English comedian, writer, and television presenter.\n\nEarly life\n\nDolan was born in Camden, London.

Overseas, it also went to number one on the VG-lista chart in Norway and a top ten hit all around the world. The song became the second and last American number one hit by Christopher Cross.\nComposer\nQuestion:\nWhat is the title of the song in the 1981 film \u2018Arthur\u2019 that won the Academy Award for Best Song?\nAnswer:\nBest That You Can Do (Arthur\u2019s Theme)\nPassage:\nFour-minute mile\nIn the sport of athletics, the four-minute mile means completing the mile run (1,760 yards, or 1,609.344 metres) in less than four minutes. It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4.  The \"four-minute barrier\" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds.  Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour (24.14\u00a0km/h, or 2:29.13 per kilometre, or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres).\n\nRecord holders\n\nBreaking the four-minute barrier was first achieved on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University's Iffley Road Track, by Englishman Roger Bannister,  with the help of fellow-runners as pacemakers.    Two months later, during the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games hosted in Vancouver, B.C., two competing runners, Australia's John Landy and Bannister, ran the distance of one mile in under four minutes. The race's end is memorialised in a statue of the two (with Landy glancing over his shoulder, thus losing the race) placed in front of the Pacific National Exhibition entrance plaza.\n\nNew Zealand's John Walker, the first man to run the mile under 3:50, managed to run 135 sub-four-minute miles during his career (during which he was the first person to run over 100 sub-four-minute miles), and American Steve Scott has run the most sub-four-minute miles, with 136. Algeria's Noureddine Morceli was the first under 3:45.  Currently, the mile record is held by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who ran a time of 3:43.13 in Rome in 1999.\n\nIn 1964, America's Jim Ryun became the first high-school runner to break four minutes for the mile, running 3:59.0 as a junior and a then American record 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965.  Tim Danielson (1966) and Marty Liquori (1967) also came in under four minutes, but Ryun's high-school record stood until Alan Webb ran 3:53.43 in 2001.  Ten years later, in 2011, Lukas Verzbicas became the fifth high-schooler under four minutes.   In 2015, Matthew Maton and Grant Fisher became the sixth and seventh high-schoolers to break four minutes, both running 3:59.38 about a month apart.   Webb was the first high schooler to run sub-4 indoors, running 3:59.86 in early 2001.  On February 6, 2016, Andrew Hunter significantly improved upon Webb's mark, running 3:58.25 on the same New York Armory track  and 3:57.81 two weeks later.   Hunter achieved the 4 minute mile mark outdoors later in the season at the Prefontaine Classic.  At that same meet Michael Slagowski joined the list of high school athletes under 4 minutes. \n\nAnother illustration of the progression of performance in the men's mile is that, in 1994, forty years after Bannister's breaking of the barrier, the Irish runner Eamonn Coghlan became the first man over the age of 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile.  Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records, World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute-mile performance as a record in the M40 division. Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark. Over 18 years after Coghlan, that was finally achieved by UK's Anthony Whiteman, running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012. \n\nNo woman has yet run a four-minute mile. , the women's world record is held by retired Russian Svetlana Masterkova, with a time of 4:12.56 in 1996. \n\nIn 1997, Daniel Komen of Kenya ran two miles in less than eight minutes, doubling up on Bannister's accomplishment.   He did it again in February 1998, falling just .3 behind his previous performance, still the only individual to accomplish the feat. \n\nPossible other claims \n\nJames Parrott\n\nSome sources (including Olympic medalist Peter Radford ) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run in London by James Parrott on 9 May 1770.   Parrott's route began on Goswell Road, before turning down Old Street, finishing at St Leonard's, Shoreditch. Although timing methods at this time were \u2013 following the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison \u2013 accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies.  Neal Bascomb notes in The Perfect Mile that \"even nineteenth-century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account.\" \n\nGlenn Cunningham\n\nIt is also reputed that Glenn Cunningham achieved a four-minute mile in a workout in the 1920s. In addition to being unsubstantiated, a workout run would not count as a record. \n\nPopular culture\n\nIn 1988, the ABC and the BBC co-produced The Four Minute Mile, a miniseries dramatisation of the race to the four-minute mile, featuring Richard Huw as Bannister and Nique Needles as John Landy (who was simultaneously pursuing the milestone). It was written by David Williamson and directed by Jim Goddard.\n\nIn 2004, Neal Bascomb wrote a book entitled The Perfect Mile about Roger Bannister, John Landy, and Wes Santee portraying their individual attempts to break the four-minute mile and the context of the sport of mile racing. A second film version (entitled Four Minutes) was made in 2005, starring Jamie Maclachlan as Bannister.\n\nIn June 2011 the watch used to time the original event was donated by Jeffrey Archer to a charity auction for Oxford University Athletics Club and sold for \u00a397,250. \n\nIn July 2016 the BBC released a documentary with firsthand interviews from Bannister and various other figures on the first sub-4 minute mile.\nQuestion:\nWho is popularly recognised as being the first person to run a mile in under 4 minutes?\nAnswer:\n3 minute mile\nPassage:\nGPO Film Unit\nThe GPO Film Unit was a subdivision of the UK General Post Office. The unit was established in 1933, taking on responsibilities of the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit. Headed by John Grierson,  it was set up to produce sponsored documentary films mainly related to the activities of the GPO.\n\nAmong the films it produced were Harry Watt's and Basil Wright's Night Mail (1936), featuring music by Benjamin Britten and poetry by W. H. Auden, which is the best known. Directors who worked for the unit included Humphrey Jennings, Alberto Cavalcanti, Paul Rotha, Harry Watt, Basil Wright and a young Norman McLaren. Poet and memoirist Laurie Lee also worked as a scriptwriter in the unit from 1939-1940.\n\nIn 1940 the GPO Film Unit became the Crown Film Unit, under the control of the Ministry of Information.\n\nIn Autumn 2008 the British Film Institute issued a first collection of selected films from the Unit. Titled Addressing The Nation, it comprises fifteen titles from the years 1933 to 1935, including Song of Ceylon. A second volume, We Live In Two Worlds was released in February 2009, with 22 films covering the period 1936 to 1938, and includes Night Mail. A third (and final) volume, If War Should Come, appeared in July 2009 and includes London Can Take It!\n\nFilmography\nQuestion:\nWhich composer (1913 to 1976) wrote the music used in the 1936 GPO film 'Night Mail'?\nAnswer:\nBritten, Benjamin\nPassage:\nMarmolada\nMarmolada (Ladin: Marmoleda) is a mountain in northeastern Italy  and the highest mountain of the Dolomites (a section of the Alps). It lies between the borders of Trentino and Veneto.\n\nGeography\n\nThe mountain is located about 100 kilometres north-northwest of Venice, from which it can be seen on a clear day. It consists of a ridge running west to east. Towards the south it breaks suddenly into sheer cliffs, forming a rock face several kilometres long. On the north side there is a comparatively flat glacier, the only large glacier in the Dolomites (the Marmolada Glacier, Ghiacciaio della Marmolada).\n\nThe ridge is composed of several summits, decreasing in altitude from west to east: Punta Penia (3,343 m), Punta Rocca (3,309 m), Punta Ombretta (3,230 m), Monte Serauta (3,069 m), and Pizzo Serauta (3,035 m). An aerial tramway goes to the top of Punta Rocca. During the ski season the Marmolada's main ski run is opened for skiers and snowboarders alike, making it possible to ski down into the valley.\n\nHistory\n\nPaul Grohmann made the first ascent in 1864, along the north route. The south face was climbed for the first time in 1901 by Beatrice Tomasson, Michele Bettega and Bartolo Zagonel.\n\nUntil the end of World War I the border between Austria-Hungary and Italy ran over Marmolada, so it formed part of the front line during that conflict. Austro-Hungarian soldiers were quartered in deep tunnels bored into the northern face's glacier, and Italian soldiers were quartered on the south face's rocky precipices.  As glaciers retreat, soldiers' remains and belongings are occasionally discovered.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Marmolada_Sunset.jpg|Sunset\nFile:Marmolada_Massif.JPG\nFile:Canazei.jpg|Marmolada from Canazei\nQuestion:\nMonte Marmolada is the highest peak in which mountain range?\nAnswer:\nDolomite Alps\n", "answers": ["Nadine Elizabeth Louise Coyle", "Outta My Mind", "Nadine Coyle discography", "NADINE COYLE", "Girl On the Loose", "Nadine Coyle"], "pred": "Jason Bell: Jason Bell: Jason Bell: Jason Bell: Jason Bell: Jason Bell: Jason Bell: Jason Bell: Jason Bell: Jason Bell: Jason Bell", "length": 3226, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "149c4c5390701fdbd5d652a6fa1890cab83ca1cd1d915301"}
{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nLate string quartets (Beethoven)\nLudwig van Beethoven's late string quartets are the following works:\n*Opus 127: String Quartet No. 12 in E-flat major (1825)\n*Opus 130: String Quartet No. 13 in B-flat major (1825)\n*Opus 131: String Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp minor (1826)\n*Opus 132: String Quartet No. 15 in A minor (1825)\n*Opus 133: Gro\u00dfe Fuge in B-flat major for string quartet (1826; originally the finale to Op. 130; it also exists in a piano transcription, Op. 134)\n*Opus 135: String Quartet No. 16 in F major (1826)\n\nThese six works are Beethoven's last major completed compositions. Although dismissed by the musicians and audiences of Beethoven's time, they are widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions of all time, and have inspired many composers and musicians. Igor Stravinsky described the Gro\u00dfe Fuge as \"an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever\". Richard Wagner, when reflecting on Op.\u00a0131's first movement, said that it \"reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music\". The quartets have been performed and recorded by string quartets worldwide.\n\nOverview\n\nPrince Nikolai Galitzine commissioned the first three quartets (numbers 12, 13 and 15) and in a letter dated 9 November 1822, offered to pay Beethoven \"what you think proper\" for the three works. Beethoven replied on 25 January 1823 with his price of 50 ducats for each opus.  Beethoven composed these quartets in the sequence 12, 15, 13, 14, 16, simultaneously writing quartets 15 and 13. \n\nBeethoven wrote the last quartets in failing health. In April 1825 he was bedridden, and remained ill for about a month. The illness\u2014or more precisely, his recovery from it\u2014is remembered for having given rise to the deeply felt slow movement of the Fifteenth Quartet, which Beethoven called \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the divinity, from one made well.\" He went on to complete the quartets now numbered Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth. The last work Beethoven completed was the substitute final movement of the Thirteenth Quartet, which replaced the difficult Gro\u00dfe Fuge.\n\nAppraisal\n\nThese quartets went far beyond the comprehension of musicians and audiences of the time. One musician commented that \"we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is.\" Composer Louis Spohr called them \"indecipherable, uncorrected horrors.\" Opinion has changed considerably from the time of their first bewildered reception: these six quartets (counting the Gro\u00dfe Fuge) comprise Beethoven's last major, completed compositions and are widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions of all time.  The musicologist Theodor Adorno, in particular, thought highly of them,  and Igor Stravinsky described the Gro\u00dfe Fuge as \"an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever\".  Their forms and ideas inspired and continue to inspire musicians and composers, such as Richard Wagner and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. Wagner, when reflecting on Op. 131's first movement, said that it \"reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music\".  The last musical wish of Schubert was to hear the Op. 131 quartet, which he did on 14 November 1828, five days before his death.  Upon listening to a performance of the Op. 131 quartet, Schubert remarked, \"After this, what is left for us to write?\"  Of the late quartets, Beethoven's favorite was the Fourteenth Quartet, op. 131 in C minor, which he rated as his most perfect single work. \n\nOther versions\n\nTranscriptions of some of the late quartets for string orchestra have been made by Arturo Toscanini and Felix Weingartner, among others.\n\nRecordings\n\nEnsembles that have recorded all the late string quartets by Beethoven include:\n\n* Alban Berg Quartet, EMI (studio early 80s)\n* Alban Berg Quartet, EMI (rec. live 1989)\n* Alexander String Quartet, Arte Nova\n* Alexander String Quartet, Foghorn Classics\n* Amadeus Quartet, DG\n* Barylli Quartet\n* Beethoven Quartet, Melodiya (rec. 1951-1972)\n* Belcea Quartet\n* Borodin Quartet, Chandos\n* Budapest String Quartet, Bridge (rec. 1941-60)\n* Budapest String Quartet, Sony (rec. 1958-61)\n* Busch Quartet, various labels (rec. 1933-41; no Gro\u00dfe Fuge)\n* Cleveland Quartet, RCA (1970s)\n* Cleveland Quartet, Telarc (1990s)\n* Colorado Quartet, Parnassus (rec. 2004-06)\n* Emerson String Quartet, DG\n* Endellion String Quartet, Warner Classics (2005-06)\n* Fine Arts Quartet, Everest/Concert-Disc (rec. 1960-65)\n* Gewandhaus-Quartett, New Classical Adventure (rec. live 1985-98)\n* Guarneri Quartet, RCA, Philips\n* Hagen Quartett, DG\n* Hollywood String Quartet, Testament\n* Hungarian Quartet, (1953 mono) EMI\n* Hungarian Quartet, (1960s stereo) EMI\n* Juilliard String Quartet, CBS studio late 60s\n* Juilliard String Quartet, CBS (rec. live 1982)\n* Kodaly Quartet, Naxos\n* LaSalle Quartet, DG (reissued on Brilliant Classics)\n* Leipziger Streichquartett, MDG\n* Lindsays, ASV\n* Medici Quartet, Nimbus\n* Melos Quartett, DG\n* Orford String Quartet, Delos\n* Orion String Quartet, Koch Classics (2008)\n* Penderecki String Quartet, Marquis (2013)\n* Petersen Quartett, Capriccio\n* Prazak Quartet, Praga\n* Quartetto Italiano, Decca\n* Smetana Quartet, Supraphon\n* Suske Quartett, Berlin Classics\n* Tak\u00e1cs Quartet, Decca (2005)\n* Talich Quartet, Calliope\n* Taneyev Quartet, Boheme\n* Tokyo String Quartet, RCA (1993)\n* Tokyo String Quartet, Harmonia Mundi (2010)\n* Vanbrugh Quartet, Intim Musik (1996)\n* Vermeer Quartet, Teldec, (rec. 1984-89)\n* Vegh Quartet, (1952 Les Discophiles Fran\u00e7ais) Music & Arts\n* Vegh Quartet, (1972 Telefunken) Na\u00efve-Astr\u00e9e\n* Wihan Quartet, Nimbus\n* Yale Quartet, Vanguard\nQuestion:\n\"When his Late String Quartets were first performed in the 1820s, listeners described them variously as \"\"indecipherable, uncorrected horrors\"\" and \"\"we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is\"\".

Formed in 1971 (as the National Breakdown Recovery Club) as an alternative to the AA and RAC, using a network of local garages and mechanics to deliver recovery and repair services instead of patrolling mechanics. Originally based in Pudsey, their operations are now controlled over several offices within the Direct Line Group.\n\nHistory\n\nGreen Flag started as an idea between two friends - Bob Slicer and Jeffery Pittock - in a pub in Bradford.\n\nAt the time, the AA and RAC were well-established, and offered assistance at the roadside. Slicer and Pittock's National Breakdown Recovery Club operated under a different model, using a network of garages and mechanics that would recover and fix member's cars. The mechanics' local knowledge was meant to provide a swifter response to calls than the established competition. When the service began as a three-man business (with Ernest Smith) in 1971, membership only covered breakdowns within a 50-mile radius of their Morley Street base in Bradford, and cost \u00a31.50 a year. Within three years, NBRC had become the UK's largest breakdown recovery firm with over 100,000 members.\n\nIn 1984 NBRC was acquired by National Car Parks (NCP) and five years later moved to new purpose-built headquarters in Pudsey, which were opened by Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nThe company was renamed Green Flag in 1994.  The company, now being run by Ernest Smith as Chief Executive, was looking to expand into other insurance services. \"Green is the symbol of health in Europe,\" Smith told The Independent at the time. \n\nNCP was bought out by US investment firm Cendant who put Green Flag up for sale in May 1999, after regulators blocked their attempt to gain critical mass by also buying RAC. Later that year, Green Flag became part of the RBS Group when it was acquired by Direct Line for \u00a3220m. \n\n2008 saw Green Flag announce that it would be branding 400 vans across its network to match its marketing. \n\nIn 2011 Green Flag reviewed its network of contractors, reducing the number of partner firms from 283 to 173, with a number of firms reacting angrily to the decision.   Now, five firms represent the majority of Green Flag's network. \n\nRBS' insurance division was floated in October 2012 as Direct Line Group. The new company had declared itself a separate entity the previous month. \n\nIn 2015, Direct Line Group announced it would consolidate their sites in Leeds area - with the closure of the old Green Flag site in Pudsey. All staff would be retained and moved to one of their two sites in Leeds Headrow and The Wharf buildings,  with Green Flag operations in Glasgow and other offices continuing as normal. \n\nServices \n\nGreen Flag offer a range of breakdown products, from basic roadside assistance to full European cover with recovery, covering cars, motorbikes, trailers and small vans.\n\nThe company claim a response time of 42 minutes and that they have over 4m customers.\n\nGreen Flag's services are also available through partners including Direct Line, Churchill, Sainsbury's Bank, Esure, RBS and NatWest. They also operate a specialist breakdown service for caravan and motorhome owners on behalf of the Caravan Club.\n\nLike the rest of the Direct Line Group, Green Flag's products are underwritten by U K Insurance Limited.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn 2010, mascot Maximili'ant was introduced to Green Flag's marketing.  An ant was chosen as the company claims \"they're hard working, strong and work well in a team - qualities reflected in the Green Flag network.\"   The character was brought to life by the voice of Harry Hill in TV and radio advertising until 2012.\n\nSponsorships \n\nIn 1994, Green Flag became the first brand to sponsor the England football team.  The deal ran from 1994 to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, including UEFA Euro 1996, and is believed to have cost the firm \u00a34m. \n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, the company were the main title sponsor British Formula 3 Championship  and then, between 2002 and 2004, the British Touring Car Championship.  This was not the company's first motorsport sponsorship, as National Breakdown had sponsored rallies between 1984 and 1987. \n\n2004 saw the company dabble in football again as they took up sponsorship of AOL's coverage of Euro 2004. \n\nThe Green Flag logo appeared on the Williams F1 team cars of Nico Rosberg and Kazuki Nakajima (2009) and Rubens Barichello and Nico H\u00fclkenberg (2010) as part of the RBS sponsorship. \n\nGreen Flag is the current sponsor of British gymnast Nile Wilson. \n\nOn 28 February 2014, Green Flag announced that it had become a sponsor of Premiership Rugby. \n\nFrom 21 June 2015 to present, Green Flag is currently the sponsor the national weather on ITV and UTV.\n\nAwards \n\nGreen Flag are multiple Your Money award winners.

This increased to a score of 87.33% and an improved ranking of 3rd in the newest Auto Express Driver Power Survey in 2014 - seeing Green Flag outrank both the AA and RAC.\nQuestion:\nIn 1995 the company National Breakdown changed its name \u2013 to what?\nAnswer:\nNational Breakdown\nPassage:\nMary Jane (shoe)\nMary Jane (Also known as bar shoes) is an American term (formerly a registered trademark) for a closed, low-cut shoe with one or more straps across the instep.\n\nClassic Mary Janes for children are typically made of black leather or patent leather, have one thin strap fastened with a buckle or button, a broad and rounded toebox, low heels, and thin outsoles. Among girls, Mary Janes are traditionally worn with pantyhose or socks, and a dress or a skirt and blouse. Among boys (less common), Mary Janes are traditionally worn with socks, short trousers, and a shirt.\n\nHistory\n\nChildren's shoes secured by a strap over the instep and fastened with a buckle or button appeared in the early 19th century. Originally worn by both sexes, they began to be perceived as being mostly for girls in the 1930s in North America and the 1940s in Europe.  They were also popular with women in the 1920s. \n\nToday, Mary Janes for children, particularly the more classic styles, are often considered semi-formal or formal shoes, appropriate for school (many schools worldwide require that girls wear them with their uniform), religious ceremonies, weddings, visits, and birthday parties for example. More modern styles are also worn in casual settings, however: playgrounds, shopping centers, sports (Mary Jane sneakers), etc. Although less popular than in the past, Mary Janes remain a timeless classic of children's fashion and, for many people, a symbol of girlhood.\n\nMoreover, Mary Janes are a preferred accessory of many traditional or folk costumes, such as those of the flamenco female dancer and of the typical woman in Mao's China and Kim's North Korea. \n\nEtymology\n\nMary Jane was a character created by Richard Felton Outcault \"Father of the Sunday Comic Strip\" for his comic strip Buster Brown, which was first published in 1902. She was the \"sweetheart\" of the title character Buster Brown and was drawn from real life, as she was also Outcault's daughter of the same name.  In Outcault's own words\u2014and his daughter's\u2014she was the only character drawn from life in the Buster Brown strip, although \"Mrs. Brown\" did resemble Outcault's wife.\n\nIn 1904, Outcault traveled to the St. Louis World's Fair and sold licenses to up to 200 companies to use the Buster Brown characters to advertise their products. Among them was the Brown Shoe Company, which later hired actors to tour the country, performing as the Buster Brown characters in theaters and stores. This strategy helped the Brown Shoe Company become the most prominently associated brand with the Buster Brown characters. The style of shoe both Buster Brown and Mary Jane wore came to be known by her name, Mary Jane.\n\nAdult styles\n\nWhile the classic Mary Jane still retains its wide popularity and appeal, platform style Mary Janes have also evolved since the late 1990s, with 1-cm to 3-cm (\u00bd-in to 1-in) outsoles and 8-cm to 13-cm (3-in to 5-in) \"chunky\" heels, often with exaggerated grommets or buckles. These styles were especially popular in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s, within punk rock, psychobilly, and goth subcultures. Many times the wearers would accent the look with knee-high knit socks in dark-colored stripes or patterns and/or some form of hosiery (stockings/pantyhose), and often complete the look with a plaid, pleated schoolgirl-style skirt.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, block heeled mary jane shoes were popular in the United Kingdom and were fastened by a rectangular chrome buckle and were made under various brand names such as No Doubt, Koi Couture etc.\n\nMary Janes are a popular part of kinderwhore and Lolita fashion. A pump with a strap across the instep may be referred to as a \"Mary Jane pump\", although it does not have the low heels or wide toe of the original Mary Jane (and a pump is generally strapless by definition).\nQuestion:\nWhat type of fashion items are \u2018Mary Janes\u2019?\nAnswer:\nOrthopaedic footwear\nPassage:\nMr. Peanut\nMr. Peanut is the advertising logo and mascot of Planters, an American snack-food company and division of Kraft Foods. He is depicted as an anthropomorphic peanut in its shell dressed in the formal clothing of an old-fashioned gentleman: a top hat, monocle, white gloves, spats, and a cane.\n\nHistory\n\nPlanters Peanut Company was founded in 1906, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania by Amedeo Obici and was incorporated two years later as the Planters Nut and Chocolate Company.  In 1916 a young schoolboy Antonio Gentile, submitted drawings of an anthropomorphic peanut, a commercial artist, Andrew S. Wallach added the monocle, top hat and cane to create the iconic image.  The schoolboy's family is believed to have received five dollars for the submission.    \n\nThere is a disputed claim that Frank P. Krize, Sr., a Wikes-Barre artist and head of the Suffolk plant, made the additions of the monocle, top hat and cane.  Andrew Wallach's daughter, Virginia, maintains that Frank P. Krize joined the project after Mr. Peanut was created.  Planter's history and other sources still in circulation, do not positively identify the artist.     \n\nBy the mid-1930s, the raffish figure had come to symbolize the entire peanut industry. Mr. Peanut has appeared on almost every Planters package and advertisement. He is now one of the best-known icons in advertising history. \n\nMr. Peanut has appeared in many TV commercials as an animated cartoon character. More recent commercials have shown him stop motion animated in a real-world setting.\n\nIn 2006, Planters conducted an online contest to determine whether to add a bow tie, cufflinks, or a pocketwatch to Mr. Peanut.  The public voted for no change. \n\nWhile the character's television commercials were often accompanied by an elegant accented narrator, Mr. Peanut never had dialogue. On November 8, 2010, Planters announced that Mr. Peanut would officially be given a voice, supplied by American actor Robert Downey Jr. \n\nIn 2011 Mr. Peanut's \"stunt double\" named Peanut Butter Doug was introduced to tie-in with the Planter's Peanut Butter launch. The character is voiced by Kevin Dillon. \n\nPlanters announced on July 1, 2013 that its mascot, Mr. Peanut, would be voiced by comedian and Saturday Night Live alumnus Bill Hader,  who, ironically, is allergic to peanuts. \n\nIn literature\n\n*In the 2010 novel Mr. Peanut, a man fantasizes about killing his peanut-allergic wife by force-feeding her peanuts.   \"He poured out a handful and ate them and then wiped the salt from his empty hand on his pants.  He looked at the chipper Planters Peanuts man tipping his top hat hello and thought about how one bite could kill Alice dead.\" \n\nIn popular culture\n\n*The artist Vincent Trasov, dressed as Mr. Peanut, ran as a joke candidate in the 1974 Vancouver, British Columbia civic elections. \n*In November 2010, The New Yorker magazine published a spoof confession by Mr. Peanut that he is gay and in a relationship with his new sidekick, Benson. \n*Mr. Peanut appears as a monster in the online game Kingdom of Loathing.\nQuestion:\nWhat type of eyewear is associated with the old rich people - and also Mr. Peanut?\nAnswer:\nMonocles\nPassage:\nNicola Sturgeon allows TV glimpse into home life - The ...\nNicola Sturgeon allows TV glimpse into home life - The Scotsman\nNicola Sturgeon allows TV glimpse into home life\nStills from a STV Spotlight interview with Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell.

Picture: STV\nMs Sturgeon denied that Mr Salmond was still pulling the strings in the SNP, but said she can always go to him for advice.\nShe contrasted their positive relationship with the \u201cdysfunctional\u201d one between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\nMs Sturgeon said there was \u201can understandable curiosity\u201d about the couple\u2019s family life, but added that Alex Salmond was rarely asked about his lack of children.\nMr Murrell, the SNP\u2019s chief executive, added that his wife gets asked a lot of questions that would not be asked of a man.\nMs Sturgeon said: \u201cAlex Salmond doesn\u2019t have children. He might tell you differently, but I\u2019m not aware of reading an interview or seeing an interview with Alex Salmond being asked that question.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019m not moaning about this, but it\u2019s just one of these things that I think is just a bit different if you\u2019re a woman in politics.\u201d\nMr Murrell added: \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those questions that a female politician gets asked. A man would never get asked about clothes or hair or something else. It\u2019s just different.\u201d\nThe couple were shown in Totty Rocks, a fashion store that supplies Ms Sturgeon with outfits.\nQuestion:\nPeter Murrell is the husband of which politician?\nAnswer:\nNICOLA STURGEON\nPassage:\nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\nAssociate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States are the members of the Supreme Court of the United States other than the Chief Justice of the United States. The number of Associate Justices is determined by the United States Congress and is currently set at eight by the Judiciary Act of 1869.\n\nLike the Chief Justice, Associate Justices are nominated by the President of the United States and are confirmed by the United States Senate by majority vote. This is provided for in Article II of the Constitution, which states that the President \"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint... Judges of the supreme Court.\" Although the Constitution refers to them as \"Judges of the Supreme Court,\" the title actually used is \"Associate Justice,\" introduced in the Judiciary Act of 1789.  Associate justices were traditionally styled \"Mr. Justice\" in court opinions, but the title was shortened to \"Justice\" in 1980, a year before the first female justice was appointed. \n\nArticle III of the Constitution specifies that Associate Justices, and all other United States federal judges \"shall hold their Offices during good Behavior\". This language means that the appointments are effectively for life, ending only when a Justice dies in office, retires, or is removed from office following impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. \n\nEach of the Justices of the Supreme Court has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the Chief Justice's vote counts no more than that of any other Justice. However, in drafting opinions, the Chief Justice enjoys additional influence in case disposition if in the majority through his power to assign who writes the opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. Furthermore, the Chief Justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The Chief Justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other Justices do not and is paid slightly more ($255,500 per year for the Chief Justice and $244,400 per year for each Associate Justice ).\n\nAssociate Justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the Chief Justice is always considered to be the most senior. If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior Justice of the two. Currently, the senior Associate Justice is Anthony Kennedy. By tradition, when the Justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Court, the justices state their views in order of seniority. If there is a knock at their conference room door, the junior justice (who sits closest to the door) must answer it. The current junior justice is Elena Kagan.\n\nUnder 28 USC [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/3.html 3], when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior Associate Justice until the disability or the vacancy ends.\n\nThe sitting Associate Justices are, ordered by seniority:\n\nFile:Anthony Kennedy official SCOTUS portrait.jpg| Anthony Kennedy\nFile:Clarence Thomas official SCOTUS portrait.jpg| Clarence Thomas\nFile:Ruth Bader Ginsburg official SCOTUS portrait.jpg| Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nFile:Stephen Breyer, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg| Stephen Breyer\nFile:010 alito.jpg| Samuel Alito\nFile:Sonia Sotomayor in SCOTUS robe.jpg| Sonia Sotomayor\nFile:Elena Kagan Official SCOTUS Portrait (2013).jpg| Elena Kagan\n\nRetired Associate Justices\n\nWhen Justices retire, they have the opportunity to assume duties similar to the senior status assumed by District and Circuit Judges. This means that the Justice keeps his or her title, and may serve by assignment on panels of the U.S. Courts of Appeals, or even the US District Courts if so requested and assigned. Retired Justices may choose to keep a set of chambers in the Supreme Court building, as well as to employ law clerks. The names of retired Associate Justices continue to appear alongside those of the active Justices of the Court on the Bound Volumes of Supreme Court decisions. However, retired Associate Justices (unlike judges on senior status) take no part in the consideration or decision of any cases before their former court (the Supreme Court), although they may be appointed by the Chief Justice to sit on lower courts.\n\nCurrently, there are three retired Associate Justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, who retired on January 31, 2006, David H. Souter, who retired on June 29, 2009, and John Paul Stevens, who retired on June 29, 2010. Both O'Connor and Souter occasionally serve on panels of the Courts of Appeals of various circuits. As of present, Stevens has chosen not to so serve.\n\nList of Associate Justices\nQuestion:\nNow considered one of the top legal minds on the court, the confirmation hearing for what current associate Supreme Court justice was marred by accusations of sexual harassment from attorney Anita Hill?\nAnswer:\nClarence Thomas\nPassage:\nRash\nA rash is a change of the skin which affects its color, appearance, or texture.\n\nA rash may be localized in one part of the body, or affect all the skin. Rashes may cause the skin to change color, itch, become warm, bumpy, chapped, dry, cracked or blistered, swell, and may be painful.\n\nThe causes, and therefore treatments for rashes, vary widely. Diagnosis must take into account such things as the appearance of the rash, other symptoms, what the patient may have been exposed to, occupation, and occurrence in family members. Rash can last 5 to 20 days, the diagnosis may confirm any number of conditions.\n\nThe presence of a rash may aid diagnosis; associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases. For example, the rash in measles is an erythematous, morbilliform, maculopapular rash that begins a few days after the fever starts. It classically starts at the head, and spreads downwards.\n\nDifferential diagnosis \n\nCommon causes of rashes include:\n* Food Allergy\n* Anxiety\n* Allergies, for example to food, dyes, medicines, insect stings, metals such as zinc or nickel; such rashes are often called hives.\n* Skin contact with an irritant\n** Fungal infection, such as ringworm\n** Balsam of Peru \n* Reaction to vaccination\n* Skin diseases such as eczema or acne\n* Exposure to sun (sunburn) or heat\n* Friction due to chafing of the skin\n* Irritation such as caused by abrasives impregnated in clothing rubbing the skin. The cloth itself may be abrasive enough for some people\n* \n* Secondary syphilis\n* Poor personal hygiene\nUncommon causes:\n* Autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis\n* Lead poisoning\n* Pregnancy\n* Repeated scratching on a particular spot\n* Lyme Disease\n* Scarlet fever\n\nConditions\n\nDiagnostic approach\n\nThe causes of a rash are numerous, which may make the evaluation of a rash extremely difficult. An accurate evaluation by a provider may only be made in the context of a thorough history (What medication is the patient taking? What is the patient's occupation? Where has the patient been?) and complete physical examination.\n\nPoints to note in the examination include:\n\n* The appearance: e.g., purpuric (typical of vasculitis and meningococcal disease), fine and like sandpaper (typical of scarlet fever); circular lesions with a central depression are typical of molluscum contagiosum (and in the past, small pox); plaques with silver scales are typical of psoriasis.\n* The distribution: e.g., the rash of scarlet fever becomes confluent and forms bright red lines in the skin creases of the neck, armpits and groins (Pastia's lines); the vesicles of chicken pox seem to follow the hollows of the body (they are more prominent along the depression of the spine on the back and in the hollows of both shoulder blades); very few rashes affect the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (secondary syphilis, rickettsia or spotted fevers, [http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hlen&lr\n&qintitle%3AA+febrile+illness+with+generalized+papular+rash+involving+the+palms+and+soles&as_publication\nClin+Infect+Dis&as_ylo2007&as_yhi\n2007&btnG=Search Scholar search] guttate psoriasis, hand, foot and mouth disease, keratoderma blennorrhagicum);\n* Symmetry: e.g., herpes zoster usually only affects one side of the body and does not cross the midline.\n\nA patch test may be ordered, for diagnostic purposes. \n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment differs according to what rash a patient has been diagnosed with. Common rashes can be easily remedied using steroid topical creams (such as hydrocortisone) or non-steroidal treatments. Many of the medications are available over the counter in the United States. \n\nThe problem with steroid topical creams i.e. hydrocortisone; is their inability to penetrate the skin through absorption and therefore not be effective in clearing up the affected area, thus rendering the hydrocortisone almost completely ineffective in all except the most mild of cases.\nQuestion:\nWhat disease is known by the symptoms of a rash and a strawberry coloured tongue\nAnswer:\nScarlatina\nPassage:\nCillit Bang\nCillit Bang (sold in some countries as Easy-Off Bam or Easy-Off Bang) is the brand name of a range of cleaning products sold by the consumer products manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser. The products marketed under the brand name include a degreaser, cleaning crystals, and a grime, rust, mould and limescale remover.\n\nProduct range\n\nCillit Bang Power Grime and Lime Spray\n\nCillit Bang Grime and Lime Spray (known in some countries as Easy off Bang/Bam Power Grime and Lime Cleaner Trigger) product contains two acids: sulfamic acid and phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid (also known as orthophosphoric acid or phosphoric (V) acid) is a weak mineral acid with the chemical formula 34 and applied to rusted iron or steel tools or surfaces to convert iron (III) oxide (rust) to a water-soluble phosphate compound.\n\nThis cleaner can be used on glass, acrylic plastic, ceramics (washbasins, toilet bowls, etc.), wall and floor tiles, PVC floor coating, copper, chrome and kitchen tops.\n\nIt should not be used on any acid sensitive material, such as marble or enamel, aluminium, stone, zinc-plated metals, kitchen worktops, linoleum, varnished, waxed or oiled wood floors, rubber, textiles or carpets.\n\nA Canadian advert for the product features a disclaimer that the Royal Canadian Mint \"neither endorses the product nor the method shown for the cleaning of coins\".\n\nCillit Bang Power Crystal\n\nCillit Bang Power Crystal (known outside the UK as Easy-Off Bang/Bam Power Cleaning Crystal) is a liquid for cleaning heavily stained surfaces. It contains not more than 5% of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, 15-30% of sodium carbonate, sodium percarbonate (the bleaching compound), and a perfume formula containing limonene. It is a skin irritant and can cause allergic reactions in some people, so the company now advises the use of gloves during prolonged exposure.\n\nAdvertising campaign\n\nUK advertisements have been presented by \"Barry Scott\", a brashly enthusiastic character played by Neil Burgess, who claims that Cillit Bang can remove limescale, rust and ground-in dirt. In one advert he places a copper-plated one penny coin in Cillit Bang to demonstrate the product's cleaning ability to remove staining.\n\nIn January 2016, Reckitt Benckiser launched its first global campaign, starring dancer Daniel Campos. \n\nOther countries' versions of the advert use different presenters, known as Martin Grellis in Australia and New Zealand, and Dan Dolan in North America, although recent spots feature Neil Burgess as Barry Scott.  Dan demonstrates the cleaning methods seen in the Cillit Bang adverts and also cleans oil spills. The North American versions of the advertisement use the appropriate one-cent coin (a Lincoln cent in the U.S., a 1953\u20131964 one cent coin in Canada).\n\nOutside Europe\n\nThe product is sold as Easy-Off BAM (a brand extension of Reckitt Benckiser's popular oven cleaner) in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Mexico, and as \"Easy-Off BANG\" in South Africa and Korea, with similar packaging and spray bottle design.\n\nIndustrial use\n\nIn August 2009 it was revealed that household cleaners such as Cillit Bang and Mr. Muscle have been used to clean plutonium stains at the defunct Dounreay nuclear power station in Caithness, Scotland.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the character played by actor Neil Burgess in the television commercial for cleaning product Cillit Bang?\nAnswer:\nBarry Scott\nPassage:\nFarthing (British coin)\nThe British farthing (\u00bcd) coin, from \"fourthing\", was a unit of currency of one quarter of a penny, or one nine hundred and sixtieth of a pound sterling. It was minted in bronze, and replaced the earlier copper farthings. It was used during the reign of six monarchs: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II, ceasing to be legal tender in 1960. It featured two different designs on its reverse during its one hundred years in circulation: from 1860 until 1936, the image of Britannia; and from 1937 onwards, the image of a wren. Like all British coinage, it bore the portrait of the monarch on the obverse. \n\nBefore Decimal Day in 1971, there were two hundred and forty pence in one pound sterling. There were four farthings in a penny, twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. three shillings and six pence (3/6), pronounced \"three and six\" or \"three and sixpence\". Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence, e.g. 8d, pronounced \"eightpence\". A price with a farthing in it would be written like this: (19/11\u00bc), pronounced \"nineteen and elevenpence farthing\".\n\nAs of 2014, the purchasing power of a farthing in 1960 (at its demise) ranged between 2p and 7p (in 2014 GB Pound values). \n\nDesign \n\nThe original reverse of the coin, designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, is a seated Britannia, holding a trident, with the word  above. Issues before 1895 also feature a lighthouse to Britannia's left and a ship to her right. Various minor adjustments to the level of the sea depicted around Britannia, and the angle of her trident were also made over the years. Some issues feature toothed edges, while others feature beading.\n\nOver the years, seven different obverses were used. Edward VII, George V, George VI and Elizabeth II each had a single obverse for farthings produced during their respective reigns. Over the long reign of Queen Victoria two different obverses were used, and the short reign of Edward VIII meant that no farthings bearing his likeness were ever issued.\n\nThe farthing was first issued with the so-called \"bun head\", or \"draped bust\" of Queen Victoria on the obverse. The inscription around the bust read  (abbreviated Latin: Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith). This was replaced in 1895 by the \"old head\", or \"veiled bust\". The inscription on these coins read  (Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith empress of India).\n\nCoins issued during the reign of Edward VII feature his likeness and bear the inscription  (Edward VII by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India). Similarly, those issued during the reign of George V feature his likeness and bear the inscription  (George V by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India).\n\nA farthing of King Edward VIII (1936) does exist, dated 1937, but technically it is a pattern coin i.e. one produced for official approval, which it would probably have been due to receive about the time that the King abdicated. The obverse shows a left-facing portrait of the king (who considered this to be his best side, and consequently broke the tradition of alternating the direction in which the monarch faces on coins \u2014 some viewed this as indicating bad luck for the reign); the inscription on the obverse is  (Edward VIII by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India).\n\nThe pattern coin of Edward VIII and regular-issue farthings of George VI and Elizabeth II feature a redesigned reverse displaying the wren, one of Britain's smallest birds.\n\nGeorge VI issue coins feature the inscription  (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India) before 1949, and  (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith) thereafter. Unlike the penny, farthings were minted throughout the early reign of Elizabeth II, bearing the inscription  (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all Britain defender of the faith) in 1953, and  (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen defender of the faith) thereafter.\n \nOBVERSE DESIGNS\n\nFile:Victoria farthing.jpg|Victoria (old)\nFile:Victorianewfarthingobv.jpg|Victoria (new)\nFile:EdwardvIIfarthingobv.jpg|Edward VII\nFile:1919farthingobv.jpg|George V\nFile:1944farthingobv.jpg|George VI\nFile:Britfarthing1954obv.jpg|Elizabeth II\n\nMintages\nQuestion:\nIn what year did the farthing cease to be legal tender in England?\nAnswer:\none thousand, nine hundred and sixty\nPassage:\nSolid mechanics\nSolid mechanics is the branch of continuum mechanics that studies the behavior of solid materials, especially their motion and deformation under the action of forces, temperature changes, phase changes, and other external or internal agents.\n\nSolid mechanics is fundamental for civil, aerospace, nuclear, and mechanical engineering, for geology, and for many branches of physics such as materials science.  It has specific applications in many other areas, such as understanding the anatomy of living beings, and the design of dental prostheses and surgical implants.  One of the most common practical applications of solid mechanics is the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. Solid mechanics extensively uses tensors to describe stresses, strains, and the relationship between them.\n\nRelationship to continuum mechanics\n\nAs shown in the following table, solid mechanics inhabits a central place within continuum mechanics.  The field of rheology presents an overlap between solid and fluid mechanics.\n\nResponse models\n\nA material has a rest shape and its shape departs away from the rest shape due to stress. The amount of departure from rest shape is called deformation, the proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied stress is sufficiently low (or the imposed strain is small enough), almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress; the coefficient of the proportion is called the modulus of elasticity.  This region of deformation is known as the linearly elastic region.\n\nIt is most common for analysts in solid mechanics to use linear material models, due to ease of computation. However, real materials often exhibit non-linear behavior. As new materials are used and old ones are pushed to their limits, non-linear material models are becoming more common.\n\nThere are four basic models that describe how a solid responds to an applied stress:\n# Elastically \u2013 When an applied stress is removed, the material returns to its undeformed state. Linearly elastic materials, those that deform proportionally to the applied load, can be described by the linear elasticity equations such as Hooke's law.\n# Viscoelastically \u2013 These are materials that behave elastically, but also have damping: when the stress is applied and removed, work has to be done against the damping effects and is converted in heat within the material resulting in a hysteresis loop in the stress\u2013strain curve. This implies that the material response has time-dependence.\n# Plastically \u2013 Materials that behave elastically generally do so when the applied stress is less than a yield value. When the stress is greater than the yield stress, the material behaves plastically and does not return to its previous state. That is, deformation that occurs after yield is permanent.\n# Thermoelasticity (physics) - There is coupling of mechanical with thermal responses. In general, thermoelasticity is concerned with elastic solids under conditions that are neither isothermal nor adiabatic. The simplest theory involves the Fourier's law of heat conduction, as opposed to advanced theories with physically more realistic models.\n\nTimeline\n\n*1452\u20131519 Leonardo da Vinci made many contributions\n*1638: Galileo Galilei published the book \"Two New Sciences\" in which he examined the failure of simple structures\n\n*1660: Hooke's law by Robert Hooke\n*1687: Isaac Newton published \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" which contains the Newton's laws of motion\n\n*1750: Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation\n*1700\u20131782: Daniel Bernoulli introduced the principle of virtual work\n*1707\u20131783: Leonhard Euler developed the theory of buckling of columns\n\n*1826: Claude-Louis Navier published a treatise on the elastic behaviors of structures\n*1873: Carlo Alberto Castigliano presented his dissertation \"Intorno ai sistemi elastici\", which contains his theorem for computing displacement as partial derivative of the strain energy.

Our first president, George Washington, picked a site on the Potomac River, midway between the northern and southern states. This spot would come to be called Washington, District of Columbia.\nPierre L'Enfant, a city planner from France, designed the new city. He decided to place the Capitol Building on one hill and the \"President's House\" on another hill. L'Enfant had many plans for building the city, but he lost his job after too many disagreements with landowners. The streets and parks that exist in Washington, D.C., today are the result of the work of two surveyors, Andrew Ellicott and Benjamin Banneker, who made maps and plans based on L'Enfant's original designs.\nThe original District of Columbia was like a wilderness, and the Potomac River caused the area to be marshy. Pigs roamed the streets, and mosquitoes made people sick from malaria. Conditions improved, however, when the marshes, creeks, and canals were drained.\nBuilding the White House\nWhile the city of Washington, D.C. was being developed, the president's house was also getting under way. A contest was held to select a designer for the house. While it is said that our third president, Thomas Jefferson, submitted designs for the house, architect James Hoban won the contest.\nWork on the house began in 1792. Stonemasons were hired from Scotland. Bricks were made on the north lawn. Sandstone was brought from Stafford County, Virginia, and lumber from North Carolina and Virginia.\nPresident George Washington oversaw construction of the White House, but he never lived there! It was our second president, John Adams, elected in 1796, who first lived in the White House. His term was almost over by the time he moved in, and only six rooms had been finished.\nWhile James Madison was president, from 1809 to 1817, the United States went to war with England. On August 24, 1814, British soldiers sailed up the Potomac River and set fire to the White House. A summer thunderstorm put out the fire, but only the charred outside walls and the interior brick walls remained. It took three years to rebuild the White House.\nWhite House Facts\nThere are 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 6 levels to accommodate all the people who live in, work in, and visit the White House. There are also 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, 8staircases, and 3 elevators.\nThe White House has six floors\u2014two basements, two public floors, and two floors for the First Family.\nAt various times in history, the White House has been known as the \"President's Palace,\" the \"President's House,\" and the \"Executive Mansion.\" President Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.\nThe White House receives approximately 6,000 visitors a day.\nWith five full-time chefs, the White House kitchen is able to serve dinner to as many as 140 guests and hors d'oeuvres to more than 1,000.\nThe White House requires 570 gallons of paint to cover its outside surface.\nFor recreation, the White House has a variety of facilities available to its residents, including a tennis court, a jogging track, a swimming pool, a movie theater, a billiard room, and a bowling lane.\nDid You Know?\nThe White House was the biggest house in the United States until the Civil War.\nSource: The White House\nQuestion:\nWhere would you find the river called The Ouse?\nAnswer:\nEnglnad\nPassage:\nCynology\nCynology is the study of matters related to canines or domestic dogs and regular dogs.\n\nIn English it may be a term sometimes used to denote serious zoological approach to the study of dogs  as well as by writers on canine subjects, dog breeders and trainers   and enthusiasts who informally study the dog.  \n\nCynology \n\nCynology is a classical compound word (from Greek , ky\u014dn, genitive , kynos, \"dog\"; and , -logia) referring to the study of dogs.  The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized scientific discipline in English-speaking countries.\nSimilar words are found in other languages, such German and Dutch kynologie, and the Russian \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f, from the Proto-Indo-European , which is the source of hound.\n\n\u03ba\u03c5\u03bd is also the source of the English word cynic, and is directly related to canine and hound.\n\nUsage in English \n\nThe suffix '-logy' in English words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study.  English Classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession.\n\nUsage in English of the word cynology is rare, and occasionally found in the names of dog training academies, with cynologist sometimes being used as a title by some dog trainers or handlers. People who informally study the dog may refer to themselves as 'cynologists' to imply serious study or scientific work.\n\nThe study of dogs \n\nStudies of dogs, and dog related matters, are carried out and published: in general, by those who have mastered the relevant literature or aspects of it, and the formal structure of the subject (National and International Kennel Club breeding, health, and show regulations etc.); in specific, by biologists, geneticists, zoologists, behaviourists, and others scientists, historians, veterinarians and breed specialists.\n\nInformally, dogs may be studied by those with no specific scientific training, such as publicists and authors, breeders, trainers, police dog handlers, animal communicators and others, through literature, history,and personal experience. Many useful books and videotapes for the public have been produced through informal study of the dog.\nThose who, very rarely, refer to themselves as \"cynologists\", may formally or informally study such things as veterinary science, dog breeding, breed development, dog behavior and training, and the literature and history of dogs.\n\nUsage in other languages \n\nCynology, may have other connotations or use in languages other than English, see German :de:Kynologie, Dutch :nl:Kynologie and Czech :cs:Sportovn\u00ed kynologie.\n\nThe very rare term cynologist in English, is generally found to refer to \"canine specialists\" such as; certified care professionals, certified show judges, breeders, breed enthusiasts, certified dog-trainers and professional dog-handlers.\n\n*A similar word is used to refer to dog handlers and dog trainers in Russia.  \n*A veterinary clinic in Armenia offers a 'cynologist' to assist with dog training. \n*A magazine in the Baltic states described as 'dedicated to the development of cynology in the Baltic countries' covers dog training, dog shows, and veterinary advice (a hobbyist magazine, not a scientific journal.)\nQuestion:\nCynology is the study of which animals?\nAnswer:\nDomestic dogs\n\n\nPassage:\nTL;DR\nTL;DR, short for \"too long; didn't read\", is an expression used in Internet culture to say that some text being replied to has been ignored or as a signifier for a summary of an online post or news article.

Although dismissed by the musicians and audiences of Beethoven's time, they are widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions of all time, and have inspired many composers and musicians. Igor Stravinsky described the Gro\u00dfe Fuge as \"an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever\". Richard Wagner, when reflecting on Op.\u00a0131's first movement, said that it \"reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music\". The quartets have been performed and recorded by string quartets worldwide.\n\nOverview\n\nPrince Nikolai Galitzine commissioned the first three quartets (numbers 12, 13 and 15) and in a letter dated 9 November 1822, offered to pay Beethoven \"what you think proper\" for the three works. Beethoven replied on 25 January 1823 with his price of 50 ducats for each opus.  Beethoven composed these quartets in the sequence 12, 15, 13, 14, 16, simultaneously writing quartets 15 and 13. \n\nBeethoven wrote the last quartets in failing health. In April 1825 he was bedridden, and remained ill for about a month. The illness\u2014or more precisely, his recovery from it\u2014is remembered for having given rise to the deeply felt slow movement of the Fifteenth Quartet, which Beethoven called \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the divinity, from one made well.\" He went on to complete the quartets now numbered Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth. The last work Beethoven completed was the substitute final movement of the Thirteenth Quartet, which replaced the difficult Gro\u00dfe Fuge.\n\nAppraisal\n\nThese quartets went far beyond the comprehension of musicians and audiences of the time. One musician commented that \"we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is.\" Composer Louis Spohr called them \"indecipherable, uncorrected horrors.\" Opinion has changed considerably from the time of their first bewildered reception: these six quartets (counting the Gro\u00dfe Fuge) comprise Beethoven's last major, completed compositions and are widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions of all time.  The musicologist Theodor Adorno, in particular, thought highly of them,  and Igor Stravinsky described the Gro\u00dfe Fuge as \"an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever\".  Their forms and ideas inspired and continue to inspire musicians and composers, such as Richard Wagner and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. Wagner, when reflecting on Op. 131's first movement, said that it \"reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music\".  The last musical wish of Schubert was to hear the Op. 131 quartet, which he did on 14 November 1828, five days before his death.  Upon listening to a performance of the Op. 131 quartet, Schubert remarked, \"After this, what is left for us to write?\"  Of the late quartets, Beethoven's favorite was the Fourteenth Quartet, op. 131 in C minor, which he rated as his most perfect single work. \n\nOther versions\n\nTranscriptions of some of the late quartets for string orchestra have been made by Arturo Toscanini and Felix Weingartner, among others.\n\nRecordings\n\nEnsembles that have recorded all the late string quartets by Beethoven include:\n\n* Alban Berg Quartet, EMI (studio early 80s)\n* Alban Berg Quartet, EMI (rec. live 1989)\n* Alexander String Quartet, Arte Nova\n* Alexander String Quartet, Foghorn Classics\n* Amadeus Quartet, DG\n* Barylli Quartet\n* Beethoven Quartet, Melodiya (rec. 1951-1972)\n* Belcea Quartet\n* Borodin Quartet, Chandos\n* Budapest String Quartet, Bridge (rec. 1941-60)\n* Budapest String Quartet, Sony (rec. 1958-61)\n* Busch Quartet, various labels (rec. 1933-41; no Gro\u00dfe Fuge)\n* Cleveland Quartet, RCA (1970s)\n* Cleveland Quartet, Telarc (1990s)\n* Colorado Quartet, Parnassus (rec. 2004-06)\n* Emerson String Quartet, DG\n* Endellion String Quartet, Warner Classics (2005-06)\n* Fine Arts Quartet, Everest/Concert-Disc (rec. 1960-65)\n* Gewandhaus-Quartett, New Classical Adventure (rec. live 1985-98)\n* Guarneri Quartet, RCA, Philips\n* Hagen Quartett, DG\n* Hollywood String Quartet, Testament\n* Hungarian Quartet, (1953 mono) EMI\n* Hungarian Quartet, (1960s stereo) EMI\n* Juilliard String Quartet, CBS studio late 60s\n* Juilliard String Quartet, CBS (rec. live 1982)\n* Kodaly Quartet, Naxos\n* LaSalle Quartet, DG (reissued on Brilliant Classics)\n* Leipziger Streichquartett, MDG\n* Lindsays, ASV\n* Medici Quartet, Nimbus\n* Melos Quartett, DG\n* Orford String Quartet, Delos\n* Orion String Quartet, Koch Classics (2008)\n* Penderecki String Quartet, Marquis (2013)\n* Petersen Quartett, Capriccio\n* Prazak Quartet, Praga\n* Quartetto Italiano, Decca\n* Smetana Quartet, Supraphon\n* Suske Quartett, Berlin Classics\n* Tak\u00e1cs Quartet, Decca (2005)\n* Talich Quartet, Calliope\n* Taneyev Quartet, Boheme\n* Tokyo String Quartet, RCA (1993)\n* Tokyo String Quartet, Harmonia Mundi (2010)\n* Vanbrugh Quartet, Intim Musik (1996)\n* Vermeer Quartet, Teldec, (rec. 1984-89)\n* Vegh Quartet, (1952 Les Discophiles Fran\u00e7ais) Music & Arts\n* Vegh Quartet, (1972 Telefunken) Na\u00efve-Astr\u00e9e\n* Wihan Quartet, Nimbus\n* Yale Quartet, Vanguard\nQuestion:\n\"When his Late String Quartets were first performed in the 1820s, listeners described them variously as \"\"indecipherable, uncorrected horrors\"\" and \"\"we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is\"\".

Formed in 1971 (as the National Breakdown Recovery Club) as an alternative to the AA and RAC, using a network of local garages and mechanics to deliver recovery and repair services instead of patrolling mechanics. Originally based in Pudsey, their operations are now controlled over several offices within the Direct Line Group.\n\nHistory\n\nGreen Flag started as an idea between two friends - Bob Slicer and Jeffery Pittock - in a pub in Bradford.\n\nAt the time, the AA and RAC were well-established, and offered assistance at the roadside. Slicer and Pittock's National Breakdown Recovery Club operated under a different model, using a network of garages and mechanics that would recover and fix member's cars. The mechanics' local knowledge was meant to provide a swifter response to calls than the established competition. When the service began as a three-man business (with Ernest Smith) in 1971, membership only covered breakdowns within a 50-mile radius of their Morley Street base in Bradford, and cost \u00a31.50 a year. Within three years, NBRC had become the UK's largest breakdown recovery firm with over 100,000 members.\n\nIn 1984 NBRC was acquired by National Car Parks (NCP) and five years later moved to new purpose-built headquarters in Pudsey, which were opened by Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nThe company was renamed Green Flag in 1994.  The company, now being run by Ernest Smith as Chief Executive, was looking to expand into other insurance services. \"Green is the symbol of health in Europe,\" Smith told The Independent at the time. \n\nNCP was bought out by US investment firm Cendant who put Green Flag up for sale in May 1999, after regulators blocked their attempt to gain critical mass by also buying RAC. Later that year, Green Flag became part of the RBS Group when it was acquired by Direct Line for \u00a3220m. \n\n2008 saw Green Flag announce that it would be branding 400 vans across its network to match its marketing. \n\nIn 2011 Green Flag reviewed its network of contractors, reducing the number of partner firms from 283 to 173, with a number of firms reacting angrily to the decision.   Now, five firms represent the majority of Green Flag's network. \n\nRBS' insurance division was floated in October 2012 as Direct Line Group. The new company had declared itself a separate entity the previous month. \n\nIn 2015, Direct Line Group announced it would consolidate their sites in Leeds area - with the closure of the old Green Flag site in Pudsey. All staff would be retained and moved to one of their two sites in Leeds Headrow and The Wharf buildings,  with Green Flag operations in Glasgow and other offices continuing as normal. \n\nServices \n\nGreen Flag offer a range of breakdown products, from basic roadside assistance to full European cover with recovery, covering cars, motorbikes, trailers and small vans.\n\nThe company claim a response time of 42 minutes and that they have over 4m customers.\n\nGreen Flag's services are also available through partners including Direct Line, Churchill, Sainsbury's Bank, Esure, RBS and NatWest. They also operate a specialist breakdown service for caravan and motorhome owners on behalf of the Caravan Club.\n\nLike the rest of the Direct Line Group, Green Flag's products are underwritten by U K Insurance Limited.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn 2010, mascot Maximili'ant was introduced to Green Flag's marketing.  An ant was chosen as the company claims \"they're hard working, strong and work well in a team - qualities reflected in the Green Flag network.\"   The character was brought to life by the voice of Harry Hill in TV and radio advertising until 2012.\n\nSponsorships \n\nIn 1994, Green Flag became the first brand to sponsor the England football team.  The deal ran from 1994 to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, including UEFA Euro 1996, and is believed to have cost the firm \u00a34m. \n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, the company were the main title sponsor British Formula 3 Championship  and then, between 2002 and 2004, the British Touring Car Championship.  This was not the company's first motorsport sponsorship, as National Breakdown had sponsored rallies between 1984 and 1987. \n\n2004 saw the company dabble in football again as they took up sponsorship of AOL's coverage of Euro 2004. \n\nThe Green Flag logo appeared on the Williams F1 team cars of Nico Rosberg and Kazuki Nakajima (2009) and Rubens Barichello and Nico H\u00fclkenberg (2010) as part of the RBS sponsorship. \n\nGreen Flag is the current sponsor of British gymnast Nile Wilson. \n\nOn 28 February 2014, Green Flag announced that it had become a sponsor of Premiership Rugby. \n\nFrom 21 June 2015 to present, Green Flag is currently the sponsor the national weather on ITV and UTV.\n\nAwards \n\nGreen Flag are multiple Your Money award winners.

This increased to a score of 87.33% and an improved ranking of 3rd in the newest Auto Express Driver Power Survey in 2014 - seeing Green Flag outrank both the AA and RAC.\nQuestion:\nIn 1995 the company National Breakdown changed its name \u2013 to what?\nAnswer:\nNational Breakdown\nPassage:\nMary Jane (shoe)\nMary Jane (Also known as bar shoes) is an American term (formerly a registered trademark) for a closed, low-cut shoe with one or more straps across the instep.\n\nClassic Mary Janes for children are typically made of black leather or patent leather, have one thin strap fastened with a buckle or button, a broad and rounded toebox, low heels, and thin outsoles. Among girls, Mary Janes are traditionally worn with pantyhose or socks, and a dress or a skirt and blouse. Among boys (less common), Mary Janes are traditionally worn with socks, short trousers, and a shirt.\n\nHistory\n\nChildren's shoes secured by a strap over the instep and fastened with a buckle or button appeared in the early 19th century. Originally worn by both sexes, they began to be perceived as being mostly for girls in the 1930s in North America and the 1940s in Europe.  They were also popular with women in the 1920s. \n\nToday, Mary Janes for children, particularly the more classic styles, are often considered semi-formal or formal shoes, appropriate for school (many schools worldwide require that girls wear them with their uniform), religious ceremonies, weddings, visits, and birthday parties for example. More modern styles are also worn in casual settings, however: playgrounds, shopping centers, sports (Mary Jane sneakers), etc. Although less popular than in the past, Mary Janes remain a timeless classic of children's fashion and, for many people, a symbol of girlhood.\n\nMoreover, Mary Janes are a preferred accessory of many traditional or folk costumes, such as those of the flamenco female dancer and of the typical woman in Mao's China and Kim's North Korea. \n\nEtymology\n\nMary Jane was a character created by Richard Felton Outcault \"Father of the Sunday Comic Strip\" for his comic strip Buster Brown, which was first published in 1902. She was the \"sweetheart\" of the title character Buster Brown and was drawn from real life, as she was also Outcault's daughter of the same name.  In Outcault's own words\u2014and his daughter's\u2014she was the only character drawn from life in the Buster Brown strip, although \"Mrs. Brown\" did resemble Outcault's wife.\n\nIn 1904, Outcault traveled to the St. Louis World's Fair and sold licenses to up to 200 companies to use the Buster Brown characters to advertise their products. Among them was the Brown Shoe Company, which later hired actors to tour the country, performing as the Buster Brown characters in theaters and stores. This strategy helped the Brown Shoe Company become the most prominently associated brand with the Buster Brown characters. The style of shoe both Buster Brown and Mary Jane wore came to be known by her name, Mary Jane.\n\nAdult styles\n\nWhile the classic Mary Jane still retains its wide popularity and appeal, platform style Mary Janes have also evolved since the late 1990s, with 1-cm to 3-cm (\u00bd-in to 1-in) outsoles and 8-cm to 13-cm (3-in to 5-in) \"chunky\" heels, often with exaggerated grommets or buckles. These styles were especially popular in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s, within punk rock, psychobilly, and goth subcultures. Many times the wearers would accent the look with knee-high knit socks in dark-colored stripes or patterns and/or some form of hosiery (stockings/pantyhose), and often complete the look with a plaid, pleated schoolgirl-style skirt.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, block heeled mary jane shoes were popular in the United Kingdom and were fastened by a rectangular chrome buckle and were made under various brand names such as No Doubt, Koi Couture etc.\n\nMary Janes are a popular part of kinderwhore and Lolita fashion. A pump with a strap across the instep may be referred to as a \"Mary Jane pump\", although it does not have the low heels or wide toe of the original Mary Jane (and a pump is generally strapless by definition).\nQuestion:\nWhat type of fashion items are \u2018Mary Janes\u2019?\nAnswer:\nOrthopaedic footwear\nPassage:\nMr. Peanut\nMr. Peanut is the advertising logo and mascot of Planters, an American snack-food company and division of Kraft Foods. He is depicted as an anthropomorphic peanut in its shell dressed in the formal clothing of an old-fashioned gentleman: a top hat, monocle, white gloves, spats, and a cane.\n\nHistory\n\nPlanters Peanut Company was founded in 1906, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania by Amedeo Obici and was incorporated two years later as the Planters Nut and Chocolate Company.  In 1916 a young schoolboy Antonio Gentile, submitted drawings of an anthropomorphic peanut, a commercial artist, Andrew S. Wallach added the monocle, top hat and cane to create the iconic image.  The schoolboy's family is believed to have received five dollars for the submission.    \n\nThere is a disputed claim that Frank P. Krize, Sr., a Wikes-Barre artist and head of the Suffolk plant, made the additions of the monocle, top hat and cane.  Andrew Wallach's daughter, Virginia, maintains that Frank P. Krize joined the project after Mr. Peanut was created.  Planter's history and other sources still in circulation, do not positively identify the artist.     \n\nBy the mid-1930s, the raffish figure had come to symbolize the entire peanut industry. Mr. Peanut has appeared on almost every Planters package and advertisement. He is now one of the best-known icons in advertising history. \n\nMr. Peanut has appeared in many TV commercials as an animated cartoon character. More recent commercials have shown him stop motion animated in a real-world setting.\n\nIn 2006, Planters conducted an online contest to determine whether to add a bow tie, cufflinks, or a pocketwatch to Mr. Peanut.  The public voted for no change. \n\nWhile the character's television commercials were often accompanied by an elegant accented narrator, Mr. Peanut never had dialogue. On November 8, 2010, Planters announced that Mr. Peanut would officially be given a voice, supplied by American actor Robert Downey Jr. \n\nIn 2011 Mr. Peanut's \"stunt double\" named Peanut Butter Doug was introduced to tie-in with the Planter's Peanut Butter launch. The character is voiced by Kevin Dillon. \n\nPlanters announced on July 1, 2013 that its mascot, Mr. Peanut, would be voiced by comedian and Saturday Night Live alumnus Bill Hader,  who, ironically, is allergic to peanuts. \n\nIn literature\n\n*In the 2010 novel Mr. Peanut, a man fantasizes about killing his peanut-allergic wife by force-feeding her peanuts.   \"He poured out a handful and ate them and then wiped the salt from his empty hand on his pants.  He looked at the chipper Planters Peanuts man tipping his top hat hello and thought about how one bite could kill Alice dead.\" \n\nIn popular culture\n\n*The artist Vincent Trasov, dressed as Mr. Peanut, ran as a joke candidate in the 1974 Vancouver, British Columbia civic elections. \n*In November 2010, The New Yorker magazine published a spoof confession by Mr. Peanut that he is gay and in a relationship with his new sidekick, Benson. \n*Mr. Peanut appears as a monster in the online game Kingdom of Loathing.\nQuestion:\nWhat type of eyewear is associated with the old rich people - and also Mr. Peanut?\nAnswer:\nMonocles\nPassage:\nNicola Sturgeon allows TV glimpse into home life - The ...\nNicola Sturgeon allows TV glimpse into home life - The Scotsman\nNicola Sturgeon allows TV glimpse into home life\nStills from a STV Spotlight interview with Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell. Picture: STV\n00:00 Friday 24 April 2015\nHave your say\nNICOLA Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell last night gave a rare glimpse into their private life when they were asked about their lack of children, her fashion choices and what it is like to be Scotland\u2019s first female First Minister.\nIn an interview with STV\u2019s Spotlight programme, Ms Sturgeon was also asked about her relationship with her predecessor Alex Salmond.\nThe couple gave a rare glimpse of their private life. Picture: STV\nMs Sturgeon denied that Mr Salmond was still pulling the strings in the SNP, but said she can always go to him for advice.\nShe contrasted their positive relationship with the \u201cdysfunctional\u201d one between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\nMs Sturgeon said there was \u201can understandable curiosity\u201d about the couple\u2019s family life, but added that Alex Salmond was rarely asked about his lack of children.\nMr Murrell, the SNP\u2019s chief executive, added that his wife gets asked a lot of questions that would not be asked of a man.\nMs Sturgeon said: \u201cAlex Salmond doesn\u2019t have children. He might tell you differently, but I\u2019m not aware of reading an interview or seeing an interview with Alex Salmond being asked that question.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019m not moaning about this, but it\u2019s just one of these things that I think is just a bit different if you\u2019re a woman in politics.\u201d\nMr Murrell added: \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those questions that a female politician gets asked. A man would never get asked about clothes or hair or something else. It\u2019s just different.\u201d\nThe couple were shown in Totty Rocks, a fashion store that supplies Ms Sturgeon with outfits.\nQuestion:\nPeter Murrell is the husband of which politician?\nAnswer:\nNICOLA STURGEON\nPassage:\nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\nAssociate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States are the members of the Supreme Court of the United States other than the Chief Justice of the United States. The number of Associate Justices is determined by the United States Congress and is currently set at eight by the Judiciary Act of 1869.\n\nLike the Chief Justice, Associate Justices are nominated by the President of the United States and are confirmed by the United States Senate by majority vote. This is provided for in Article II of the Constitution, which states that the President \"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint... Judges of the supreme Court.\" Although the Constitution refers to them as \"Judges of the Supreme Court,\" the title actually used is \"Associate Justice,\" introduced in the Judiciary Act of 1789.  Associate justices were traditionally styled \"Mr. Justice\" in court opinions, but the title was shortened to \"Justice\" in 1980, a year before the first female justice was appointed. \n\nArticle III of the Constitution specifies that Associate Justices, and all other United States federal judges \"shall hold their Offices during good Behavior\". This language means that the appointments are effectively for life, ending only when a Justice dies in office, retires, or is removed from office following impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. \n\nEach of the Justices of the Supreme Court has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the Chief Justice's vote counts no more than that of any other Justice. However, in drafting opinions, the Chief Justice enjoys additional influence in case disposition if in the majority through his power to assign who writes the opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. Furthermore, the Chief Justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The Chief Justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other Justices do not and is paid slightly more ($255,500 per year for the Chief Justice and $244,400 per year for each Associate Justice ).\n\nAssociate Justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the Chief Justice is always considered to be the most senior. If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior Justice of the two. Currently, the senior Associate Justice is Anthony Kennedy. By tradition, when the Justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Court, the justices state their views in order of seniority. If there is a knock at their conference room door, the junior justice (who sits closest to the door) must answer it. The current junior justice is Elena Kagan.\n\nUnder 28 USC [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/3.html 3], when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior Associate Justice until the disability or the vacancy ends.\n\nThe sitting Associate Justices are, ordered by seniority:\n\nFile:Anthony Kennedy official SCOTUS portrait.jpg| Anthony Kennedy\nFile:Clarence Thomas official SCOTUS portrait.jpg| Clarence Thomas\nFile:Ruth Bader Ginsburg official SCOTUS portrait.jpg| Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nFile:Stephen Breyer, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg| Stephen Breyer\nFile:010 alito.jpg| Samuel Alito\nFile:Sonia Sotomayor in SCOTUS robe.jpg| Sonia Sotomayor\nFile:Elena Kagan Official SCOTUS Portrait (2013).jpg| Elena Kagan\n\nRetired Associate Justices\n\nWhen Justices retire, they have the opportunity to assume duties similar to the senior status assumed by District and Circuit Judges. This means that the Justice keeps his or her title, and may serve by assignment on panels of the U.S. Courts of Appeals, or even the US District Courts if so requested and assigned. Retired Justices may choose to keep a set of chambers in the Supreme Court building, as well as to employ law clerks. The names of retired Associate Justices continue to appear alongside those of the active Justices of the Court on the Bound Volumes of Supreme Court decisions. However, retired Associate Justices (unlike judges on senior status) take no part in the consideration or decision of any cases before their former court (the Supreme Court), although they may be appointed by the Chief Justice to sit on lower courts.\n\nCurrently, there are three retired Associate Justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, who retired on January 31, 2006, David H. Souter, who retired on June 29, 2009, and John Paul Stevens, who retired on June 29, 2010. Both O'Connor and Souter occasionally serve on panels of the Courts of Appeals of various circuits. As of present, Stevens has chosen not to so serve.\n\nList of Associate Justices\nQuestion:\nNow considered one of the top legal minds on the court, the confirmation hearing for what current associate Supreme Court justice was marred by accusations of sexual harassment from attorney Anita Hill?\nAnswer:\nClarence Thomas\nPassage:\nRash\nA rash is a change of the skin which affects its color, appearance, or texture.\n\nA rash may be localized in one part of the body, or affect all the skin. Rashes may cause the skin to change color, itch, become warm, bumpy, chapped, dry, cracked or blistered, swell, and may be painful.\n\nThe causes, and therefore treatments for rashes, vary widely. Diagnosis must take into account such things as the appearance of the rash, other symptoms, what the patient may have been exposed to, occupation, and occurrence in family members. Rash can last 5 to 20 days, the diagnosis may confirm any number of conditions.\n\nThe presence of a rash may aid diagnosis; associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases. For example, the rash in measles is an erythematous, morbilliform, maculopapular rash that begins a few days after the fever starts. It classically starts at the head, and spreads downwards.\n\nDifferential diagnosis \n\nCommon causes of rashes include:\n* Food Allergy\n* Anxiety\n* Allergies, for example to food, dyes, medicines, insect stings, metals such as zinc or nickel; such rashes are often called hives.\n* Skin contact with an irritant\n** Fungal infection, such as ringworm\n** Balsam of Peru \n* Reaction to vaccination\n* Skin diseases such as eczema or acne\n* Exposure to sun (sunburn) or heat\n* Friction due to chafing of the skin\n* Irritation such as caused by abrasives impregnated in clothing rubbing the skin. The cloth itself may be abrasive enough for some people\n* \n* Secondary syphilis\n* Poor personal hygiene\nUncommon causes:\n* Autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis\n* Lead poisoning\n* Pregnancy\n* Repeated scratching on a particular spot\n* Lyme Disease\n* Scarlet fever\n\nConditions\n\nDiagnostic approach\n\nThe causes of a rash are numerous, which may make the evaluation of a rash extremely difficult. An accurate evaluation by a provider may only be made in the context of a thorough history (What medication is the patient taking? What is the patient's occupation? Where has the patient been?) and complete physical examination.\n\nPoints to note in the examination include:\n\n* The appearance: e.g., purpuric (typical of vasculitis and meningococcal disease), fine and like sandpaper (typical of scarlet fever); circular lesions with a central depression are typical of molluscum contagiosum (and in the past, small pox); plaques with silver scales are typical of psoriasis.\n* The distribution: e.g., the rash of scarlet fever becomes confluent and forms bright red lines in the skin creases of the neck, armpits and groins (Pastia's lines); the vesicles of chicken pox seem to follow the hollows of the body (they are more prominent along the depression of the spine on the back and in the hollows of both shoulder blades); very few rashes affect the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (secondary syphilis, rickettsia or spotted fevers, [http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hlen&lr\n&qintitle%3AA+febrile+illness+with+generalized+papular+rash+involving+the+palms+and+soles&as_publication\nClin+Infect+Dis&as_ylo2007&as_yhi\n2007&btnG=Search Scholar search] guttate psoriasis, hand, foot and mouth disease, keratoderma blennorrhagicum);\n* Symmetry: e.g., herpes zoster usually only affects one side of the body and does not cross the midline.\n\nA patch test may be ordered, for diagnostic purposes. \n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment differs according to what rash a patient has been diagnosed with. Common rashes can be easily remedied using steroid topical creams (such as hydrocortisone) or non-steroidal treatments. Many of the medications are available over the counter in the United States. \n\nThe problem with steroid topical creams i.e. hydrocortisone; is their inability to penetrate the skin through absorption and therefore not be effective in clearing up the affected area, thus rendering the hydrocortisone almost completely ineffective in all except the most mild of cases.\nQuestion:\nWhat disease is known by the symptoms of a rash and a strawberry coloured tongue\nAnswer:\nScarlatina\nPassage:\nCillit Bang\nCillit Bang (sold in some countries as Easy-Off Bam or Easy-Off Bang) is the brand name of a range of cleaning products sold by the consumer products manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser. The products marketed under the brand name include a degreaser, cleaning crystals, and a grime, rust, mould and limescale remover.\n\nProduct range\n\nCillit Bang Power Grime and Lime Spray\n\nCillit Bang Grime and Lime Spray (known in some countries as Easy off Bang/Bam Power Grime and Lime Cleaner Trigger) product contains two acids: sulfamic acid and phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid (also known as orthophosphoric acid or phosphoric (V) acid) is a weak mineral acid with the chemical formula 34 and applied to rusted iron or steel tools or surfaces to convert iron (III) oxide (rust) to a water-soluble phosphate compound.\n\nThis cleaner can be used on glass, acrylic plastic, ceramics (washbasins, toilet bowls, etc.), wall and floor tiles, PVC floor coating, copper, chrome and kitchen tops.\n\nIt should not be used on any acid sensitive material, such as marble or enamel, aluminium, stone, zinc-plated metals, kitchen worktops, linoleum, varnished, waxed or oiled wood floors, rubber, textiles or carpets.\n\nA Canadian advert for the product features a disclaimer that the Royal Canadian Mint \"neither endorses the product nor the method shown for the cleaning of coins\".\n\nCillit Bang Power Crystal\n\nCillit Bang Power Crystal (known outside the UK as Easy-Off Bang/Bam Power Cleaning Crystal) is a liquid for cleaning heavily stained surfaces. It contains not more than 5% of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, 15-30% of sodium carbonate, sodium percarbonate (the bleaching compound), and a perfume formula containing limonene. It is a skin irritant and can cause allergic reactions in some people, so the company now advises the use of gloves during prolonged exposure.\n\nAdvertising campaign\n\nUK advertisements have been presented by \"Barry Scott\", a brashly enthusiastic character played by Neil Burgess, who claims that Cillit Bang can remove limescale, rust and ground-in dirt. In one advert he places a copper-plated one penny coin in Cillit Bang to demonstrate the product's cleaning ability to remove staining.\n\nIn January 2016, Reckitt Benckiser launched its first global campaign, starring dancer Daniel Campos. \n\nOther countries' versions of the advert use different presenters, known as Martin Grellis in Australia and New Zealand, and Dan Dolan in North America, although recent spots feature Neil Burgess as Barry Scott.  Dan demonstrates the cleaning methods seen in the Cillit Bang adverts and also cleans oil spills. The North American versions of the advertisement use the appropriate one-cent coin (a Lincoln cent in the U.S., a 1953\u20131964 one cent coin in Canada).\n\nOutside Europe\n\nThe product is sold as Easy-Off BAM (a brand extension of Reckitt Benckiser's popular oven cleaner) in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Mexico, and as \"Easy-Off BANG\" in South Africa and Korea, with similar packaging and spray bottle design.\n\nIndustrial use\n\nIn August 2009 it was revealed that household cleaners such as Cillit Bang and Mr. Muscle have been used to clean plutonium stains at the defunct Dounreay nuclear power station in Caithness, Scotland.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the character played by actor Neil Burgess in the television commercial for cleaning product Cillit Bang?\nAnswer:\nBarry Scott\nPassage:\nFarthing (British coin)\nThe British farthing (\u00bcd) coin, from \"fourthing\", was a unit of currency of one quarter of a penny, or one nine hundred and sixtieth of a pound sterling. It was minted in bronze, and replaced the earlier copper farthings. It was used during the reign of six monarchs: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II, ceasing to be legal tender in 1960. It featured two different designs on its reverse during its one hundred years in circulation: from 1860 until 1936, the image of Britannia; and from 1937 onwards, the image of a wren. Like all British coinage, it bore the portrait of the monarch on the obverse. \n\nBefore Decimal Day in 1971, there were two hundred and forty pence in one pound sterling. There were four farthings in a penny, twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. three shillings and six pence (3/6), pronounced \"three and six\" or \"three and sixpence\". Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence, e.g. 8d, pronounced \"eightpence\". A price with a farthing in it would be written like this: (19/11\u00bc), pronounced \"nineteen and elevenpence farthing\".\n\nAs of 2014, the purchasing power of a farthing in 1960 (at its demise) ranged between 2p and 7p (in 2014 GB Pound values). \n\nDesign \n\nThe original reverse of the coin, designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, is a seated Britannia, holding a trident, with the word  above. Issues before 1895 also feature a lighthouse to Britannia's left and a ship to her right. Various minor adjustments to the level of the sea depicted around Britannia, and the angle of her trident were also made over the years. Some issues feature toothed edges, while others feature beading.\n\nOver the years, seven different obverses were used. Edward VII, George V, George VI and Elizabeth II each had a single obverse for farthings produced during their respective reigns. Over the long reign of Queen Victoria two different obverses were used, and the short reign of Edward VIII meant that no farthings bearing his likeness were ever issued.\n\nThe farthing was first issued with the so-called \"bun head\", or \"draped bust\" of Queen Victoria on the obverse. The inscription around the bust read  (abbreviated Latin: Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith). This was replaced in 1895 by the \"old head\", or \"veiled bust\". The inscription on these coins read  (Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith empress of India).\n\nCoins issued during the reign of Edward VII feature his likeness and bear the inscription  (Edward VII by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India). Similarly, those issued during the reign of George V feature his likeness and bear the inscription  (George V by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India).\n\nA farthing of King Edward VIII (1936) does exist, dated 1937, but technically it is a pattern coin i.e. one produced for official approval, which it would probably have been due to receive about the time that the King abdicated. The obverse shows a left-facing portrait of the king (who considered this to be his best side, and consequently broke the tradition of alternating the direction in which the monarch faces on coins \u2014 some viewed this as indicating bad luck for the reign); the inscription on the obverse is  (Edward VIII by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India).\n\nThe pattern coin of Edward VIII and regular-issue farthings of George VI and Elizabeth II feature a redesigned reverse displaying the wren, one of Britain's smallest birds.\n\nGeorge VI issue coins feature the inscription  (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India) before 1949, and  (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith) thereafter. Unlike the penny, farthings were minted throughout the early reign of Elizabeth II, bearing the inscription  (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all Britain defender of the faith) in 1953, and  (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen defender of the faith) thereafter.\n \nOBVERSE DESIGNS\n\nFile:Victoria farthing.jpg|Victoria (old)\nFile:Victorianewfarthingobv.jpg|Victoria (new)\nFile:EdwardvIIfarthingobv.jpg|Edward VII\nFile:1919farthingobv.jpg|George V\nFile:1944farthingobv.jpg|George VI\nFile:Britfarthing1954obv.jpg|Elizabeth II\n\nMintages\nQuestion:\nIn what year did the farthing cease to be legal tender in England?\nAnswer:\none thousand, nine hundred and sixty\nPassage:\nSolid mechanics\nSolid mechanics is the branch of continuum mechanics that studies the behavior of solid materials, especially their motion and deformation under the action of forces, temperature changes, phase changes, and other external or internal agents.\n\nSolid mechanics is fundamental for civil, aerospace, nuclear, and mechanical engineering, for geology, and for many branches of physics such as materials science.  It has specific applications in many other areas, such as understanding the anatomy of living beings, and the design of dental prostheses and surgical implants.  One of the most common practical applications of solid mechanics is the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. Solid mechanics extensively uses tensors to describe stresses, strains, and the relationship between them.\n\nRelationship to continuum mechanics\n\nAs shown in the following table, solid mechanics inhabits a central place within continuum mechanics.  The field of rheology presents an overlap between solid and fluid mechanics.\n\nResponse models\n\nA material has a rest shape and its shape departs away from the rest shape due to stress. The amount of departure from rest shape is called deformation, the proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied stress is sufficiently low (or the imposed strain is small enough), almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress; the coefficient of the proportion is called the modulus of elasticity.  This region of deformation is known as the linearly elastic region.\n\nIt is most common for analysts in solid mechanics to use linear material models, due to ease of computation. However, real materials often exhibit non-linear behavior. As new materials are used and old ones are pushed to their limits, non-linear material models are becoming more common.\n\nThere are four basic models that describe how a solid responds to an applied stress:\n# Elastically \u2013 When an applied stress is removed, the material returns to its undeformed state. Linearly elastic materials, those that deform proportionally to the applied load, can be described by the linear elasticity equations such as Hooke's law.\n# Viscoelastically \u2013 These are materials that behave elastically, but also have damping: when the stress is applied and removed, work has to be done against the damping effects and is converted in heat within the material resulting in a hysteresis loop in the stress\u2013strain curve. This implies that the material response has time-dependence.\n# Plastically \u2013 Materials that behave elastically generally do so when the applied stress is less than a yield value. When the stress is greater than the yield stress, the material behaves plastically and does not return to its previous state. That is, deformation that occurs after yield is permanent.\n# Thermoelasticity (physics) - There is coupling of mechanical with thermal responses. In general, thermoelasticity is concerned with elastic solids under conditions that are neither isothermal nor adiabatic. The simplest theory involves the Fourier's law of heat conduction, as opposed to advanced theories with physically more realistic models.\n\nTimeline\n\n*1452\u20131519 Leonardo da Vinci made many contributions\n*1638: Galileo Galilei published the book \"Two New Sciences\" in which he examined the failure of simple structures\n\n*1660: Hooke's law by Robert Hooke\n*1687: Isaac Newton published \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" which contains the Newton's laws of motion\n\n*1750: Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation\n*1700\u20131782: Daniel Bernoulli introduced the principle of virtual work\n*1707\u20131783: Leonhard Euler developed the theory of buckling of columns\n\n*1826: Claude-Louis Navier published a treatise on the elastic behaviors of structures\n*1873: Carlo Alberto Castigliano presented his dissertation \"Intorno ai sistemi elastici\", which contains his theorem for computing displacement as partial derivative of the strain energy.

Our first president, George Washington, picked a site on the Potomac River, midway between the northern and southern states. This spot would come to be called Washington, District of Columbia.\nPierre L'Enfant, a city planner from France, designed the new city. He decided to place the Capitol Building on one hill and the \"President's House\" on another hill. L'Enfant had many plans for building the city, but he lost his job after too many disagreements with landowners. The streets and parks that exist in Washington, D.C., today are the result of the work of two surveyors, Andrew Ellicott and Benjamin Banneker, who made maps and plans based on L'Enfant's original designs.\nThe original District of Columbia was like a wilderness, and the Potomac River caused the area to be marshy. Pigs roamed the streets, and mosquitoes made people sick from malaria. Conditions improved, however, when the marshes, creeks, and canals were drained.\nBuilding the White House\nWhile the city of Washington, D.C. was being developed, the president's house was also getting under way. A contest was held to select a designer for the house. While it is said that our third president, Thomas Jefferson, submitted designs for the house, architect James Hoban won the contest.\nWork on the house began in 1792. Stonemasons were hired from Scotland. Bricks were made on the north lawn. Sandstone was brought from Stafford County, Virginia, and lumber from North Carolina and Virginia.\nPresident George Washington oversaw construction of the White House, but he never lived there! It was our second president, John Adams, elected in 1796, who first lived in the White House. His term was almost over by the time he moved in, and only six rooms had been finished.\nWhile James Madison was president, from 1809 to 1817, the United States went to war with England. On August 24, 1814, British soldiers sailed up the Potomac River and set fire to the White House. A summer thunderstorm put out the fire, but only the charred outside walls and the interior brick walls remained. It took three years to rebuild the White House.\nWhite House Facts\nThere are 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 6 levels to accommodate all the people who live in, work in, and visit the White House. There are also 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, 8staircases, and 3 elevators.\nThe White House has six floors\u2014two basements, two public floors, and two floors for the First Family.\nAt various times in history, the White House has been known as the \"President's Palace,\" the \"President's House,\" and the \"Executive Mansion.\" President Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.\nThe White House receives approximately 6,000 visitors a day.\nWith five full-time chefs, the White House kitchen is able to serve dinner to as many as 140 guests and hors d'oeuvres to more than 1,000.\nThe White House requires 570 gallons of paint to cover its outside surface.\nFor recreation, the White House has a variety of facilities available to its residents, including a tennis court, a jogging track, a swimming pool, a movie theater, a billiard room, and a bowling lane.\nDid You Know?\nThe White House was the biggest house in the United States until the Civil War.\nSource: The White House\nQuestion:\nWhere would you find the river called The Ouse?\nAnswer:\nEnglnad\nPassage:\nCynology\nCynology is the study of matters related to canines or domestic dogs and regular dogs.\n\nIn English it may be a term sometimes used to denote serious zoological approach to the study of dogs  as well as by writers on canine subjects, dog breeders and trainers   and enthusiasts who informally study the dog.  \n\nCynology \n\nCynology is a classical compound word (from Greek , ky\u014dn, genitive , kynos, \"dog\"; and , -logia) referring to the study of dogs.  The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized scientific discipline in English-speaking countries.\nSimilar words are found in other languages, such German and Dutch kynologie, and the Russian \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f, from the Proto-Indo-European , which is the source of hound.\n\n\u03ba\u03c5\u03bd is also the source of the English word cynic, and is directly related to canine and hound.\n\nUsage in English \n\nThe suffix '-logy' in English words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study.  English Classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession.\n\nUsage in English of the word cynology is rare, and occasionally found in the names of dog training academies, with cynologist sometimes being used as a title by some dog trainers or handlers. People who informally study the dog may refer to themselves as 'cynologists' to imply serious study or scientific work.\n\nThe study of dogs \n\nStudies of dogs, and dog related matters, are carried out and published: in general, by those who have mastered the relevant literature or aspects of it, and the formal structure of the subject (National and International Kennel Club breeding, health, and show regulations etc.); in specific, by biologists, geneticists, zoologists, behaviourists, and others scientists, historians, veterinarians and breed specialists.\n\nInformally, dogs may be studied by those with no specific scientific training, such as publicists and authors, breeders, trainers, police dog handlers, animal communicators and others, through literature, history,and personal experience. Many useful books and videotapes for the public have been produced through informal study of the dog.\nThose who, very rarely, refer to themselves as \"cynologists\", may formally or informally study such things as veterinary science, dog breeding, breed development, dog behavior and training, and the literature and history of dogs.\n\nUsage in other languages \n\nCynology, may have other connotations or use in languages other than English, see German :de:Kynologie, Dutch :nl:Kynologie and Czech :cs:Sportovn\u00ed kynologie.\n\nThe very rare term cynologist in English, is generally found to refer to \"canine specialists\" such as; certified care professionals, certified show judges, breeders, breed enthusiasts, certified dog-trainers and professional dog-handlers.\n\n*A similar word is used to refer to dog handlers and dog trainers in Russia.  \n*A veterinary clinic in Armenia offers a 'cynologist' to assist with dog training. \n*A magazine in the Baltic states described as 'dedicated to the development of cynology in the Baltic countries' covers dog training, dog shows, and veterinary advice (a hobbyist magazine, not a scientific journal.)\nQuestion:\nCynology is the study of which animals?\nAnswer:\nDomestic dogs\n", "answers": ["TL;DR", "Tl;dr", "Too long, didn't read", "TL-DR", "Too long; didn't read"], "pred": "In 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022", "length": 8661, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "42b7163ca5fcda38a777f17176b4c409f9a58af228b841bf"}

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nRooster Cogburn (character)\nReuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn is a fictional character who first appeared in the 1968 Charles Portis novel, True Grit.\n\nThe novel was adapted into a 1969 film, True Grit, and from that a 1975 sequel entitled Rooster Cogburn was also produced.  The character was also featured in a made-for-television sequel, entitled True Grit: A Further Adventure, made in 1978. The Coen brothers released a new film version of the novel in 2010. \n\nIn the 1969 and 1975 theatrical releases, Cogburn was portrayed by John Wayne. Unusually for Wayne, who usually portrayed straight-laced heroes, Cogburn is portrayed as a curmudgeonly antihero. The 1978 TV sequel starred Warren Oates in the featured role.  The 2010 film stars Jeff Bridges as Cogburn.\n\nJohn Wayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Cogburn in the 1969 film. On January 24, 2011, Jeff Bridges was nominated for the same award for his portrayal of Cogburn.\n\nFictional character biography \n\nReuben Cogburn was born on July 15, 1825. Cogburn was a veteran of the American Civil War who served under Confederate guerrilla leader William Quantrill, where he lost his eye. He was twice married, first to an Illinois woman who left him to return to her first husband after bearing Cogburn a single, extremely clumsy son, Horace, (of whom Cogburn says, \"He never liked me anyway\"), and second to a Texas woman who wanted him to be a lawyer. Cogburn is described as a \"fearless, one-eyed U.S. marshal who never knew a dry day in his life.\" He was \"the toughest marshal\" working the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) on behalf of Judge Isaac Parker,[http://www.rollspel.com/engelsk/western/eparker.htm Isaac \"Hanging Judge\" Parker] the real-life judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas (having criminal jurisdiction in the Indian Territory, as the bailiff repeatedly announces in both films). Cogburn shot a total of 64 men in eight years, killing 60 (not counting the men he killed after the first film of Rooster Cogburn, as then it would have been 70 shot and 66 killed). He killed 23 in four years and 60 by eight, all of whom he claimed to have killed in self-defense, in the line of duty, or fleeing justice.\n\nIn the 1969 film, Cogburn helped a headstrong 14-year-old girl, named Mattie Ross (Kim Darby), along with Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Glen Campbell), to track down Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), the man who drunkenly killed her father. In the sequel, he teamed up with elderly spinster Eula Goodnight (Katharine Hepburn) and an Indian boy named Wolf (Richard Romancito) while on the trail of the desperado, Hawk (Richard Jordan), who had stolen a shipment of nitroglycerin from the U.S. Army and killed family members of both Goodnight and Wolf.\n\nCogburn lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas in the back of a Chinese dry-goods store, along with the proprietor, his friend and gambling buddy Chen Lee, and an orange tabby cat named after Confederate General Sterling Price for his entire life as a marshal.\n\nIn the 2010 film, while Cogburn demonstrated a ruthless attitude towards the criminals and fugitives he pursued, he was generally very fair with Mattie and was shown to have a distaste for what he viewed as unnecessary cruelty.  When LaBoeuf is birching Mattie for her refusal to return to Fort Smith, Cogburn demanded that he stop, and drew his pistol in threat to make LaBoeuf stop.  Later in the film, when Cogburn and Mattie witnessed two children caning a mule with sharpened sticks, Cogburn quickly intervened, cutting the mule loose and roughly throwing the two children onto the ground in retaliation.  After Mattie was snakebitten, he rode through the night, holding her, in order to get her medical care. When the horse collapsed, he mercy-killed it with his revolver and then carried her a long distance in his arms to get her to a doctor, both saving her life and proving he really had the true grit Mattie thought he did.\n\nCogburn's relationship with LaBoeuf was strained throughout the film, with the two arguing frequently.  Cogburn often made light of the Texas Rangers, much to LaBoeuf's outrage, and irritatedly criticized LaBoeuf's tendency to talk long-windedly. Likewise, LaBoeuf patronized Cogburn for being an ineffective drunk who routinely relents to Mattie's stubbornness. Their greatest point of contention came during an argument about their military service during the American Civil War, during which Cogburn ended their agreement of splitting the reward on Tom Chaney when they brought him back to Texas when LaBoeuf insulted Capt Quantrill. He did, however, thank LaBoeuf for saving his life when \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper was about to kill him and said he was in his debt before leaving with the snakebitten Mattie and promising to send help back.\n\nIn both True Grit films, Cogburn confessed to having robbed something after the war before becoming a marshal, a bank in his youth in the 2010 film, and a federal paymaster in the 1969. He spoke admiringly of Quantrill, with whom he served during the Civil War. Twenty-five years after the Tom Chaney hunt, Cogburn wrote Mattie Ross a letter with a flyer enclosed saying he was travelling with a Wild West show and asked if she would like to come visit him when the show came to Memphis and \"swap stories with an old trail mate\". He said he would understand if the journey were too long. Unfortunately, Cogburn died three days before she arrived while the show was still in Jonesboro, Arkansas and was buried in a Memphis, Tennessee Confederate cemetery. When Mattie arrived in Memphis and learned of his death, she had his body removed to her family farm plot in Yell County Arkansas and has visited it over the years. His gravestone shows his full name to be Reuben Cogburn, a fact which he gave freely in the 2010 version of the film (and in the 1975 sequel to the original movie before that).\nQuestion:\nWho played US Marshall Reuben J \u2018Rooster\u2019 Cogburn in the 2010 film \u2018True Grit\u2019?\nAnswer:\nBe Here Soon\nPassage:\nThe Four Feathers\nThe Four Feathers is a 1902 adventure novel by British writer A. E. W. Mason that has inspired many films of the same title. In December 1901, Cornhill Magazine announced the title as one of two new serial stories to be published in the forthcoming year.  Against the background of the Mahdist War, young Faversham disgraces himself by quitting the army, which others perceive as cowardice, symbolized by the four white feathers they give him. He redeems himself with acts of great courage and wins back the heart of the woman he loves. \n\nPlot summary\n\nThe novel tells the story of a British officer, Harry Faversham, who resigns from his commission in the Royal North Surrey Regiment just after Lord Garnet Wolseley's 1882 expedition to Egypt to suppress the rising of Colonel Ahmed Orabi. He is censured for cowardice by three of his comrades, Captain Trench as well as Lieutenants Castleton and Willoughby, which is signified by their delivery of three white feathers to him. His fianc\u00e9e, Ethne Eustace, breaks off their engagement and also gives him a white feather. His best friend in the regiment, Captain Durrance, becomes a rival for Ethne.\n\nHarry talks with Lieutenant Sutch, a friend of his father, who is an imposing retired general. He questions his own motives, but says he will redeem himself by acts that will convince his critics to take back the feathers. He travels on his own to Egypt and Sudan, where in 1882 Muhammad Ahmed proclaimed himself the Mahdi (Guided One) and raised a Holy War. On 26 January 1885, his Dervish forces captured Khartoum and killed its British governor, General Charles George Gordon. Most of the action over the next six years takes place in the eastern Sudan, where the British and Egyptians held Suakin. Durrance is blinded by sunstroke and invalided. Castleton is reportedly killed at Tamai, where a British square is briefly broken by a Mahdi attack. \n\nHarry's first success comes when he recovers lost letters of Gordon. He is aided by a Sudanese Arab, Abou Fatma. Later, disguised as a mad Greek musician, Harry gets imprisoned in Omdurman, where he rescues Captain Trench, who had been captured on a reconnaissance mission. They escape.\n\nLearning of his actions, Willoughby and Trench give Ethne the feathers they had taken back from Harry. He returns to England, and sees Ethne for what he thinks is one last time, as she has decided to devote herself to the blind Durrance. But Durrance tells her his blindness is incurable and frees her for Harry. Ethne and Harry wed, and Durrance travels to \"the East\" as a civilian. \n\nThe story is rich in characters and subplots, which the filmed versions trim. Some versions have made major changes in the story line. The best-known 1939 version is set at the time of the 1898 campaign and battle of Omdurman, but this is a future event only hinted at in the novel.\n\nFilm, TV and theatrical adaptations\n\nThis novel's story has been adapted as films several times, with all films retaining much of the same storyline. For example, the celebrated 1939 cinematic version, produced by Alexander Korda and Ralph Richardson, begins just after the death of Gordon in 1885. Most of its action takes place over a three-year period between 1895 and 1898, climaxing with the Battle of Omdurman.\n\nIn the 1929 silent version, a square of Highlanders is broken, but saved by Faversham and the Egyptian garrison of a besieged fort. Set in the 1880s, its great moment comes when wild hippos in a river attack the Dervishes pursuing Faversham. \n\nThe films each feature a British square broken in a dramatic battle sequence. This is only mentioned in the novel, in a battle in which the square recovered. The various film versions differ in the precise historical context.\n\nThe 2002 version starring Heath Ledger is set during the 1884\u201385 campaign. Critics consider it to be the worst adaptation of the novel. While the British infantry square was briefly broken in this battle, the British in reality won the battle though their advance was delayed. The film version portrays their being defeated in this battle. Critics complained that the film did not explore the characters sufficiently, and had historical inaccuracies in uniform dress. The central battle is more accurately treated in the film Khartoum (1966). \n\nThe many versions differ in the ethnicity of the Sudanese guide, Abou Fatma, who assists young Faversham in his desert adventure. For instance, in the 1977 film, he is an Arab, and in 2002 version, he is a black African. \n\nThe enemy forces, Islamic rebels called Dervishes, of The Mahdi, are the same, as are the geographic settings of Britain, Egypt and the Sudan).\n\nThe various film versions are as follows:\nQuestion:\nWhich former MP wrote The Four Feathers and stories featuring Inspector Hanaud?\nAnswer:\nA.E.W. Mason\nPassage:\nJewish mysticism\nAcademic study of Jewish mysticism, especially since Gershom Scholem's Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (1941), distinguishes between different forms of mysticism across different eras of Jewish history. Of these, Kabbalah, which emerged in 12th-century Europe, is the most well known, but not the only typologic form, or the earliest to emerge. Among previous forms were Merkabah mysticism (c. 100 BCE\u00a0\u2013 1000 CE), and Chassidei Ashkenaz (early 13th century CE) around the time of Kabbalistic emergence.\n\nKabbalah means \"received tradition\", a term previously used in other Judaic contexts, but which the Medieval Kabbalists adopted for their own doctrine to express the belief that they were not innovating, but merely revealing the ancient hidden esoteric tradition of the Torah. This issue is crystallised until today by alternative views on the origin of the Zohar, the main text of Kabbalah. Traditional Kabbalists regard it as originating in Tannaic times, redacting the Oral Torah, so do not make a sharp distinction between Kabbalah and early Rabbinic Jewish mysticism. Academic scholars regard it as a synthesis from Medieval times, but assimilating and incorporating into itself earlier forms of Jewish mystical tradition, as well as other philosophical elements.\n\nThe theosophical aspect of Kabbalah itself developed through two historical forms: \"Medieval/Classic/Zoharic Kabbalah\" (c.1175\u00a0\u2013 1492\u00a0\u2013 1570), and Lurianic Kabbalah (1569 CE\u00a0\u2013 today) which assimilated Medieval Kabbalah into its wider system and became the basis for modern Jewish Kabbalah. After Luria, two new mystical forms popularised Kabbalah in Judaism: antinomian-heretical Sabbatean movements (1666\u00a0\u2013 18th century CE), and Hasidic Judaism (1734 CE\u00a0\u2013 today). In contemporary Judaism, the only main forms of Jewish mysticism followed are esoteric Lurianic Kabbalah and its later commentaries, the variety of schools in Hasidic Judaism, and Neo-Hasidism (incorporating Neo-Kabbalah) in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations.\n\nTwo non-Jewish syncretic traditions also popularised Judaic Kabbalah through its incorporation as part of general Western esoteric culture from the Renaissance onwards: theological Christian Cabala (c. 15th \u00a0\u2013 18th century) which adapted Judaic Kabbalistic doctrine to Christian belief, and its diverging occultist offshoot Hermetic Qabalah (c. 15th century\u00a0\u2013 today) which became a main element in esoteric and magical societies and teachings. As separate traditions of development outside Judaism, drawing from, syncretically adapting, and different in nature and aims from Judaic mysticism, they are not listed on this page.\n\nThree aims in Jewish mysticism \n\nThe Kabbalistic form of Jewish mysticism itself divides into three general streams: the Theosophical/Speculative Kabbalah (seeking to understand and describe the divine realm), the Meditative/Ecstatic Kabbalah (seeking to achieve a mystical union with God), and the Practical/Magical Kabbalah (seeking to theurgically alter the divine realms and the World). These three different, but inter-relating, methods or aims of mystical involvement are also found throughout the other pre-Kabbalistic and post-Kabbalistic stages in Jewish mystical development, as three general typologies. As in Kabbalah, the same text can contain aspects of all three approaches, though the three streams often distill into three separate literatures under the influence of particular exponents or eras.\n\nWithin Kabbalah, the theosophical tradition is distinguished from many forms of mysticism in other religions by its doctrinal form as a mystical \"philosophy\" of Gnosis esoteric knowledge. Instead, the tradition of Meditative Kabbalah has similarity of aim, if not form, with usual traditions of general mysticism; to unite the individual intuitively with God. The tradition of theurgic Practical Kabbalah in Judaism, censored and restricted by mainstream Jewish Kabbalists, has similarities with non-Jewish Hermetic Qabalah magical Western Esotericism. However, as understood by Jewish Kabbalists, it is censored and forgotten in contemporary times because without the requisite purity and holy motive, it would degenerate into impure and forbidden magic. Consequently, it has formed a minor tradition in Jewish mystical history.\n\nHistorical forms of Jewish mysticism timeline \n\nImage:Chronology of Israel eng.png|center|760px\ndefault Jewish history\nrect 658 156 833 176 Periods of massive immigration to the land of Israel\nrect 564 156 647 175 Periods in which the majority of Jews lived in exile\nrect 460 156 554 175 Periods in which the majority of Jews lived in the land of Israel, with full or partial independence\nrect 314 156 452 175 Periods in which a Jewish Temple existed\nrect 196 156 309 175 Jewish history\nrect 26 102 134 122 Shoftim\nrect 134 102 265 121 Melakhim\nrect 146 83 266 104 First Temple\nrect 286 83 418 103 Second Temple\nrect 341 103 392 121 Zugot\nrect 393 103 453 121 Tannaim\nrect 452 102 534 221 Amoraim\nrect 534 102 560 121 Savoraim\nrect 559 103 691 121 Geonim\nrect 691 102 825 121 Rishonim\nrect 825 100 940 120 Acharonim\nrect 939 94 959 120 Aliyot\nrect 957 65 975 121 Israel\nrect 940 62 958 94 The Holocaust\nrect 825 62 941 100 Diaspora\nrect 808 61 825 101 Expulsion from Spain\nrect 428 62 808 103 Roman exile\npoly 226 82 410 82 410 92 428 92 428 61 226 62 Assyrian Exile (Ten Lost Tribes)\nrect 264 82 284 122 Babylonian captivity\nrect 283 103 341 121 Second Temple period\npoly 26 121 17 121 17 63 225 63 226 81 145 82 145 101 26 101 Ancient Jewish History\nrect 58 136 375 146 Chronology of the Bible\nrect 356 122 373 135 Common Era\ndesc none\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the Jewish mystical interpretation of Scripture, which comprises the Sepher Yezirah (Book of Creation) and the Zohar (Splendour) that has become popular with new age types?\nAnswer:\nKabbalistically\n\n\nPassage:\nDeath to Spies\nReleased in 2007, Death to Spies () is a stealth third-person shooter PC game set in World War II and produced by 1C Company and Haggard Games.

On January 24, 2011, Jeff Bridges was nominated for the same award for his portrayal of Cogburn.\n\nFictional character biography \n\nReuben Cogburn was born on July 15, 1825. Cogburn was a veteran of the American Civil War who served under Confederate guerrilla leader William Quantrill, where he lost his eye. He was twice married, first to an Illinois woman who left him to return to her first husband after bearing Cogburn a single, extremely clumsy son, Horace, (of whom Cogburn says, \"He never liked me anyway\"), and second to a Texas woman who wanted him to be a lawyer. Cogburn is described as a \"fearless, one-eyed U.S. marshal who never knew a dry day in his life.\" He was \"the toughest marshal\" working the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) on behalf of Judge Isaac Parker,[http://www.rollspel.com/engelsk/western/eparker.htm Isaac \"Hanging Judge\" Parker] the real-life judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas (having criminal jurisdiction in the Indian Territory, as the bailiff repeatedly announces in both films). Cogburn shot a total of 64 men in eight years, killing 60 (not counting the men he killed after the first film of Rooster Cogburn, as then it would have been 70 shot and 66 killed). He killed 23 in four years and 60 by eight, all of whom he claimed to have killed in self-defense, in the line of duty, or fleeing justice.\n\nIn the 1969 film, Cogburn helped a headstrong 14-year-old girl, named Mattie Ross (Kim Darby), along with Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Glen Campbell), to track down Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), the man who drunkenly killed her father. In the sequel, he teamed up with elderly spinster Eula Goodnight (Katharine Hepburn) and an Indian boy named Wolf (Richard Romancito) while on the trail of the desperado, Hawk (Richard Jordan), who had stolen a shipment of nitroglycerin from the U.S. Army and killed family members of both Goodnight and Wolf.\n\nCogburn lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas in the back of a Chinese dry-goods store, along with the proprietor, his friend and gambling buddy Chen Lee, and an orange tabby cat named after Confederate General Sterling Price for his entire life as a marshal.\n\nIn the 2010 film, while Cogburn demonstrated a ruthless attitude towards the criminals and fugitives he pursued, he was generally very fair with Mattie and was shown to have a distaste for what he viewed as unnecessary cruelty.  When LaBoeuf is birching Mattie for her refusal to return to Fort Smith, Cogburn demanded that he stop, and drew his pistol in threat to make LaBoeuf stop.  Later in the film, when Cogburn and Mattie witnessed two children caning a mule with sharpened sticks, Cogburn quickly intervened, cutting the mule loose and roughly throwing the two children onto the ground in retaliation.  After Mattie was snakebitten, he rode through the night, holding her, in order to get her medical care. When the horse collapsed, he mercy-killed it with his revolver and then carried her a long distance in his arms to get her to a doctor, both saving her life and proving he really had the true grit Mattie thought he did.\n\nCogburn's relationship with LaBoeuf was strained throughout the film, with the two arguing frequently.  Cogburn often made light of the Texas Rangers, much to LaBoeuf's outrage, and irritatedly criticized LaBoeuf's tendency to talk long-windedly. Likewise, LaBoeuf patronized Cogburn for being an ineffective drunk who routinely relents to Mattie's stubbornness. Their greatest point of contention came during an argument about their military service during the American Civil War, during which Cogburn ended their agreement of splitting the reward on Tom Chaney when they brought him back to Texas when LaBoeuf insulted Capt Quantrill. He did, however, thank LaBoeuf for saving his life when \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper was about to kill him and said he was in his debt before leaving with the snakebitten Mattie and promising to send help back.\n\nIn both True Grit films, Cogburn confessed to having robbed something after the war before becoming a marshal, a bank in his youth in the 2010 film, and a federal paymaster in the 1969. He spoke admiringly of Quantrill, with whom he served during the Civil War. Twenty-five years after the Tom Chaney hunt, Cogburn wrote Mattie Ross a letter with a flyer enclosed saying he was travelling with a Wild West show and asked if she would like to come visit him when the show came to Memphis and \"swap stories with an old trail mate\". He said he would understand if the journey were too long. Unfortunately, Cogburn died three days before she arrived while the show was still in Jonesboro, Arkansas and was buried in a Memphis, Tennessee Confederate cemetery. When Mattie arrived in Memphis and learned of his death, she had his body removed to her family farm plot in Yell County Arkansas and has visited it over the years. His gravestone shows his full name to be Reuben Cogburn, a fact which he gave freely in the 2010 version of the film (and in the 1975 sequel to the original movie before that).\nQuestion:\nWho played US Marshall Reuben J \u2018Rooster\u2019 Cogburn in the 2010 film \u2018True Grit\u2019?\nAnswer:\nBe Here Soon\nPassage:\nThe Four Feathers\nThe Four Feathers is a 1902 adventure novel by British writer A. E. W. Mason that has inspired many films of the same title. In December 1901, Cornhill Magazine announced the title as one of two new serial stories to be published in the forthcoming year.  Against the background of the Mahdist War, young Faversham disgraces himself by quitting the army, which others perceive as cowardice, symbolized by the four white feathers they give him. He redeems himself with acts of great courage and wins back the heart of the woman he loves. \n\nPlot summary\n\nThe novel tells the story of a British officer, Harry Faversham, who resigns from his commission in the Royal North Surrey Regiment just after Lord Garnet Wolseley's 1882 expedition to Egypt to suppress the rising of Colonel Ahmed Orabi. He is censured for cowardice by three of his comrades, Captain Trench as well as Lieutenants Castleton and Willoughby, which is signified by their delivery of three white feathers to him. His fianc\u00e9e, Ethne Eustace, breaks off their engagement and also gives him a white feather. His best friend in the regiment, Captain Durrance, becomes a rival for Ethne.\n\nHarry talks with Lieutenant Sutch, a friend of his father, who is an imposing retired general. He questions his own motives, but says he will redeem himself by acts that will convince his critics to take back the feathers. He travels on his own to Egypt and Sudan, where in 1882 Muhammad Ahmed proclaimed himself the Mahdi (Guided One) and raised a Holy War. On 26 January 1885, his Dervish forces captured Khartoum and killed its British governor, General Charles George Gordon. Most of the action over the next six years takes place in the eastern Sudan, where the British and Egyptians held Suakin. Durrance is blinded by sunstroke and invalided. Castleton is reportedly killed at Tamai, where a British square is briefly broken by a Mahdi attack. \n\nHarry's first success comes when he recovers lost letters of Gordon. He is aided by a Sudanese Arab, Abou Fatma. Later, disguised as a mad Greek musician, Harry gets imprisoned in Omdurman, where he rescues Captain Trench, who had been captured on a reconnaissance mission. They escape.\n\nLearning of his actions, Willoughby and Trench give Ethne the feathers they had taken back from Harry. He returns to England, and sees Ethne for what he thinks is one last time, as she has decided to devote herself to the blind Durrance. But Durrance tells her his blindness is incurable and frees her for Harry. Ethne and Harry wed, and Durrance travels to \"the East\" as a civilian. \n\nThe story is rich in characters and subplots, which the filmed versions trim. Some versions have made major changes in the story line. The best-known 1939 version is set at the time of the 1898 campaign and battle of Omdurman, but this is a future event only hinted at in the novel.\n\nFilm, TV and theatrical adaptations\n\nThis novel's story has been adapted as films several times, with all films retaining much of the same storyline. For example, the celebrated 1939 cinematic version, produced by Alexander Korda and Ralph Richardson, begins just after the death of Gordon in 1885. Most of its action takes place over a three-year period between 1895 and 1898, climaxing with the Battle of Omdurman.\n\nIn the 1929 silent version, a square of Highlanders is broken, but saved by Faversham and the Egyptian garrison of a besieged fort. Set in the 1880s, its great moment comes when wild hippos in a river attack the Dervishes pursuing Faversham. \n\nThe films each feature a British square broken in a dramatic battle sequence. This is only mentioned in the novel, in a battle in which the square recovered. The various film versions differ in the precise historical context.\n\nThe 2002 version starring Heath Ledger is set during the 1884\u201385 campaign. Critics consider it to be the worst adaptation of the novel. While the British infantry square was briefly broken in this battle, the British in reality won the battle though their advance was delayed. The film version portrays their being defeated in this battle. Critics complained that the film did not explore the characters sufficiently, and had historical inaccuracies in uniform dress. The central battle is more accurately treated in the film Khartoum (1966). \n\nThe many versions differ in the ethnicity of the Sudanese guide, Abou Fatma, who assists young Faversham in his desert adventure. For instance, in the 1977 film, he is an Arab, and in 2002 version, he is a black African. \n\nThe enemy forces, Islamic rebels called Dervishes, of The Mahdi, are the same, as are the geographic settings of Britain, Egypt and the Sudan).\n\nThe various film versions are as follows:\nQuestion:\nWhich former MP wrote The Four Feathers and stories featuring Inspector Hanaud?\nAnswer:\nA.E.W. Mason\nPassage:\nJewish mysticism\nAcademic study of Jewish mysticism, especially since Gershom Scholem's Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (1941), distinguishes between different forms of mysticism across different eras of Jewish history. Of these, Kabbalah, which emerged in 12th-century Europe, is the most well known, but not the only typologic form, or the earliest to emerge. Among previous forms were Merkabah mysticism (c. 100 BCE\u00a0\u2013 1000 CE), and Chassidei Ashkenaz (early 13th century CE) around the time of Kabbalistic emergence.\n\nKabbalah means \"received tradition\", a term previously used in other Judaic contexts, but which the Medieval Kabbalists adopted for their own doctrine to express the belief that they were not innovating, but merely revealing the ancient hidden esoteric tradition of the Torah. This issue is crystallised until today by alternative views on the origin of the Zohar, the main text of Kabbalah. Traditional Kabbalists regard it as originating in Tannaic times, redacting the Oral Torah, so do not make a sharp distinction between Kabbalah and early Rabbinic Jewish mysticism. Academic scholars regard it as a synthesis from Medieval times, but assimilating and incorporating into itself earlier forms of Jewish mystical tradition, as well as other philosophical elements.\n\nThe theosophical aspect of Kabbalah itself developed through two historical forms: \"Medieval/Classic/Zoharic Kabbalah\" (c.1175\u00a0\u2013 1492\u00a0\u2013 1570), and Lurianic Kabbalah (1569 CE\u00a0\u2013 today) which assimilated Medieval Kabbalah into its wider system and became the basis for modern Jewish Kabbalah. After Luria, two new mystical forms popularised Kabbalah in Judaism: antinomian-heretical Sabbatean movements (1666\u00a0\u2013 18th century CE), and Hasidic Judaism (1734 CE\u00a0\u2013 today). In contemporary Judaism, the only main forms of Jewish mysticism followed are esoteric Lurianic Kabbalah and its later commentaries, the variety of schools in Hasidic Judaism, and Neo-Hasidism (incorporating Neo-Kabbalah) in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations.\n\nTwo non-Jewish syncretic traditions also popularised Judaic Kabbalah through its incorporation as part of general Western esoteric culture from the Renaissance onwards: theological Christian Cabala (c. 15th \u00a0\u2013 18th century) which adapted Judaic Kabbalistic doctrine to Christian belief, and its diverging occultist offshoot Hermetic Qabalah (c. 15th century\u00a0\u2013 today) which became a main element in esoteric and magical societies and teachings. As separate traditions of development outside Judaism, drawing from, syncretically adapting, and different in nature and aims from Judaic mysticism, they are not listed on this page.\n\nThree aims in Jewish mysticism \n\nThe Kabbalistic form of Jewish mysticism itself divides into three general streams: the Theosophical/Speculative Kabbalah (seeking to understand and describe the divine realm), the Meditative/Ecstatic Kabbalah (seeking to achieve a mystical union with God), and the Practical/Magical Kabbalah (seeking to theurgically alter the divine realms and the World). These three different, but inter-relating, methods or aims of mystical involvement are also found throughout the other pre-Kabbalistic and post-Kabbalistic stages in Jewish mystical development, as three general typologies. As in Kabbalah, the same text can contain aspects of all three approaches, though the three streams often distill into three separate literatures under the influence of particular exponents or eras.\n\nWithin Kabbalah, the theosophical tradition is distinguished from many forms of mysticism in other religions by its doctrinal form as a mystical \"philosophy\" of Gnosis esoteric knowledge. Instead, the tradition of Meditative Kabbalah has similarity of aim, if not form, with usual traditions of general mysticism; to unite the individual intuitively with God. The tradition of theurgic Practical Kabbalah in Judaism, censored and restricted by mainstream Jewish Kabbalists, has similarities with non-Jewish Hermetic Qabalah magical Western Esotericism. However, as understood by Jewish Kabbalists, it is censored and forgotten in contemporary times because without the requisite purity and holy motive, it would degenerate into impure and forbidden magic. Consequently, it has formed a minor tradition in Jewish mystical history.\n\nHistorical forms of Jewish mysticism timeline \n\nImage:Chronology of Israel eng.png|center|760px\ndefault Jewish history\nrect 658 156 833 176 Periods of massive immigration to the land of Israel\nrect 564 156 647 175 Periods in which the majority of Jews lived in exile\nrect 460 156 554 175 Periods in which the majority of Jews lived in the land of Israel, with full or partial independence\nrect 314 156 452 175 Periods in which a Jewish Temple existed\nrect 196 156 309 175 Jewish history\nrect 26 102 134 122 Shoftim\nrect 134 102 265 121 Melakhim\nrect 146 83 266 104 First Temple\nrect 286 83 418 103 Second Temple\nrect 341 103 392 121 Zugot\nrect 393 103 453 121 Tannaim\nrect 452 102 534 221 Amoraim\nrect 534 102 560 121 Savoraim\nrect 559 103 691 121 Geonim\nrect 691 102 825 121 Rishonim\nrect 825 100 940 120 Acharonim\nrect 939 94 959 120 Aliyot\nrect 957 65 975 121 Israel\nrect 940 62 958 94 The Holocaust\nrect 825 62 941 100 Diaspora\nrect 808 61 825 101 Expulsion from Spain\nrect 428 62 808 103 Roman exile\npoly 226 82 410 82 410 92 428 92 428 61 226 62 Assyrian Exile (Ten Lost Tribes)\nrect 264 82 284 122 Babylonian captivity\nrect 283 103 341 121 Second Temple period\npoly 26 121 17 121 17 63 225 63 226 81 145 82 145 101 26 101 Ancient Jewish History\nrect 58 136 375 146 Chronology of the Bible\nrect 356 122 373 135 Common Era\ndesc none\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the Jewish mystical interpretation of Scripture, which comprises the Sepher Yezirah (Book of Creation) and the Zohar (Splendour) that has become popular with new age types?\nAnswer:\nKabbalistically\n", "answers": ["Smert' Shpionam", "SMERSH", "\u0421\u041c\u0415\u0420\u0428", "Smersh", "NKVD Special Section"], "pred": "Death to Spies: Moment of Truth.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nSussex pond pudding\nSussex pond pudding is a traditional English pudding from the South East county of Sussex. Made of a suet pastry which encases a whole lemon, with butter and sugar, it is boiled or steamed for several hours. The dish is first recorded in Hannah Woolley's 1672 book, The Queen-Like Closet.\n\nThis rich and heavy pudding has gone out of fashion over the years due to health and diet consciousness, although  the British chef Heston Blumenthal is trying to revive this type of traditional cookery.\n\nA variant, Currant pond pudding, is known from both Sussex and Kent. \n\nPreparation\n\nWhile cooking, the filling ingredients create a thick, caramelized sauce, which upon serving and cutting of the pudding, runs out and pools around the plate, creating a \u201cpond\u201d.  After cooking for so long, the skin of the lemon almost candies like a marmalade in its own juices and that of the butter and sugar.\n\nThe most authentic recipes call for beef suet for making the pastry which is available in all supermarkets in the UK, but vegetable shortening, or even cold butter, can be substituted for similar results.\n\nThe best lemons to use in this pudding are thin skinned, juicy ones that have not been waxed.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first recorded recipe for the Sussex pond pudding was in Hannah Woolley's The Queen-Like Closet (1672). Woolley suggests encasing a whole apple. \n\nMuch older cookery books and recipes do not actually call for use of a lemon at all.  Here is one found by Florence White: \n\n\u201dThis was given us at Chailey, Sussex, by a nursemaid in 1880 or thereabouts.  It was made for me boiled in a cloth (the correct way) in 1905 by an old cottage woman in the village of Westham.  In Sussex cottages, steak and kidney puddings are still (1931) boiled in a cloth only.\u201d \u2013H.J. Glover\n\nThe first recorded use of a version using a whole lemon was in Jane Grigson's English Food (1974).\n\nIn her A History of English Food, Clarissa Dickson Wright describes the pudding as requiring \"considerable flair to make\", as the cook needs to scratch the lemon \"so that its flavours burst out while it is being cooked.\" She notes also that the Sussex shopkeeper Thomas Turner recorded in his diary of the 1750s and 1760s that he ate variants such as currant pond pudding and plum suet pudding.\nQuestion:\nWhich fruit would you find in the centre of a Sussex Pond Pudding?\nAnswer:\nLemon\nPassage:\nCharolais cattle\nThe Charolais is a breed of taurine beef cattle from the Charolais area surrounding Charolles, in Burgundy, in eastern France. Charolais are raised for meat; they may be crossed with other breeds, including Angus and Hereford cattle. A cross-breed with Brahmans is called Charbray and is recognised as a breed in some countries.\n\nHistory \n\nOutside France\n\nThe breed was introduced to the southern United States from Mexico in 1946.Then later In 1965 it was introduced in the northern New England states from Canada   \n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe breed tends to be large-muscled, with bulls weighing up to 1100 kg and cows up to 900 kg. In England, a bull of this breed has reached a weight of 2 tonnes. \n\nDistribution\n\nThe Charolais is the second-most common cattle breed in France after the Holstein and the most common beef breed, ahead of the  Limousin. France had 4.22 million head of Charolais cattle as of Dec. 31, 2014, including 1.56 million cows, declining 0.6% from a year earlier.  The Charolais is a world breed: it is reported to DAD-IS by 68 countries, of which 37 report population data. The world population is estimated at about 730,000. The largest populations are reported from the Czech Republic and Mexico.\nQuestion:\n'Charolais' and 'Semental' are both breeds of what?\nAnswer:\nSurat al-An'am\nPassage:\nDavid Vanian\nDave Vanian (born David Lett, 12 October 1956) is a rock musician and lead singer of the punk rock band The Damned. Formed in 1976 in London, The Damned were the first British punk band to release a single, an album, have a record hit the UK charts, and tour the United States. With a fluid line-up since their founding, Vanian has been the only ever-present member.\n\nCareer\n\nBorn in Hemel Hempstead, Vanian changed his name from Lett to Vanian in early life after a previous stint as a gravedigger \u2013 Vanian being a play on \"Transylvanian\". He remains one of the early influencers of gothic fashion, wearing dark and otherworldly clothing both on stage and off. He is known to be a fan of renaissance art, film noir and horror movies, all of which manifest in his stage appearance. In November 1976, the British music magazine NME stated that Vanian \"resembles a runaway from the Addams Family\". \n\nIn 1978, he was guest in the song \"Don't Panic England\", from the band Doctors of Madness. In 2004, he and Captain Sensible turned on the Christmas lights in Cambridge, causing some controversy. \n\nVanian sang with the MC5 for their 40th anniversary singing \"Looking at You\", which was released as part of Revolution: A Celebration of the MC5.

At 16, he studied under Joan Littlewood and has been an actor since he was 18. \n\nDean's breakthrough performance was playing criminal 'Jack Lynn' in Law And Order (1978). He went on to have roles in television shows such as Minder (1979); Up Pompeii! (1971), Doctor Who (1977); Shoestring (1979); Hammer House of Horror (1980) and The Chinese Detective (1981). In 1980, he played Jeff \"Fangio\" Bateman in Coronation Street and, in 1983, he was cast as Sergeant Jack Wilding in Woodentop  (the Pilot of ITV police drama The Bill).\n\nFilm credits include: Up Pompeii (1971), Murder by Decree (1979), Sweet William (1980), The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980), P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang (1982), and as a bouncer in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (1980).\n\nAt the invitation of producer Julia Smith, he was offered the role of Pete Beale, an original character in the BBC's new soap opera EastEnders; Dean was chosen after the actor who originally auditioned for the role (Leslie Grantham) was selected to play the character Den Watts instead. Dean played the cockney fruit and veg trader from the show's inception in February 1985 until his departure in May 1993. In reality, Dean's contract was terminated following irreconcilable differences with the show's producers. Since his departure, he has publicly slammed the producers for culling his character and did an expos\u00e9 with the Sun newspaper, where he revealed some of the show's secrets and his opinions about former co-stars.  Subsequently, Pete Beale was killed in an off-screen death in episodes that aired in December 1993. Co-star June Brown (who plays Dot Cotton in the show) allegedly quit the show in protest following Dean's sacking in 1993, but returned in 1997. Brown and Dean attempted to set up a production company together, but it did not come to fruition. \n\nSince leaving EastEnders, Dean's television credits have been few, although he has made guest appearances on Channel 4 sketch show Bo' Selecta!, Banzai and Little Britain. He appeared in the Five television show Harry and Cosh in 2002 and regularly appears in pantomimes. In 1993 he was due to tour in the play Entertaining Mr Sloane with Barbara Windsor but left during rehearsals and was replaced by John Challis. Dean will be appearing in pantomime in December 2015 as the evil Abanazar in Aladdin at Harpenden Public Halls. \n\nPersonal life\n\nBorn in Hoxton, East London, Dean was an acquaintance of the Kray twins while he was growing up. He went to primary school in Holloway and technical school at King\u2019s Cross, where he learnt plumbing and bricklaying. He started drama lessons at 14 when his grandmother, the music hall artist Lilly Randall, realised that he was dyslexic. As a boy, Dean worked on a fruit and veg stall in Chapel Market in North London.\n\nHe has been married twice. His first marriage, which ended after three years, produced one daughter, Leah. He met his second wife, Jean, when he was 29 and she was 15; she was babysitting for a mutual acquaintance. Dean is divorced and lives in Wood Green, North London.\n\nDean is a practising Buddhist. This is the reason why he was always seen drinking from a pewter tankard in EastEnders, because he does not drink beer and would only drink lemonade. He also races greyhounds, although after a recent appearance on the BBC's [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03lv3dn Pointless Celebrities], there have been questions about how ethical his disposal of his retiring dogs might be.\nQuestion:\nWhich character was once played by Peter Dean in Eastenders?\nAnswer:\nPete Beale\nPassage:\nMount Arafat\nMount Arafat or Mount Arafah ( transliterated Jabal \u2018Araf\u0101t) is a granite hill east of Mecca in the plain of Arafat. Arafat is a plain about 20 km southeast of Mecca.  Mount Arafat reaches about 70 m in height and is also known as the Mount of Mercy (Jabal ar-Rahmah). According to Islamic tradition, the hill is the place where the Islamic prophet Muhammad stood and delivered the Farewell Sermon to the Muslims who had accompanied him for the Hajj towards the end of his life.\n\nOn the 9th of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah pilgrims go to Arafat from Mina, for the most important part of the Hajj. The Khutbah of Hajj is narrated and Zuhr prayer and Asr prayer are prayed together. The pilgrims spend the whole day on the mountain to supplicate to Allah to forgive their sins and to pray for personal strength in the future.\n\nHajj \n\nArafah rituals end at sunset and pilgrims then move to Muzdalifah for a shortened Maghrib Prayer and Isha prayer and for a short rest.\n\nThe level area surrounding the hill is called the Plain of Arafat. The term Mount Arafah is sometimes applied to this entire area. It is an important place in Islam because during the Hajj, pilgrims spend the afternoon there on the ninth day of Dhul Hijjah (\u0630\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0629). Failure to be present in the plain of Arafat on the required day invalidates the pilgrimage.\n\nSince late 2010, this place is served by Mecca Metro. On a normal Hajj, it would be around 13 mi to walk.\n\nIn literature \n\nThe hill is also referenced in James Joyce's novel Finnegans Wake.\nQuestion:\nMashair Railway that opened in 2010 connecting the sites of Mina, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat serves the visitors of what city?\nAnswer:\nMecca (metro)\nPassage:\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in ...\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange\nEtymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames\n6\nThere is clearly a prefix in names like McDonald, McChrystal, O\u2019Brian, O\u2019Neal.\nWhat does this Mc- and O- prefix signify? It looks like Donald, Chrystal, Brian, Neal are perfectly fine names on their own, so why is there a prefix before it?\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou forgot to mention another prefix for names, that is \"Fitz\" as in Fitzgerald.

(What is true is that O' is almost exclusively Irish; despite the romantic notions we have of Scottish clans, they didn't use their clan affiliation in their names.)\nEdit: as for why the prefix is used even though the prefix-less names look perfectly fine on their own, this is basically Gaelic grammar and thus out of scope for this site. Suffice it to say, some languages are fine with unmarked patronymics \u2014 names that identify the bearer's father using the unmodified given name \u2014 but Gaelic is not one of them.\nup vote -1 down vote\nI found the following quote which could be helpful.

Made of a suet pastry which encases a whole lemon, with butter and sugar, it is boiled or steamed for several hours. The dish is first recorded in Hannah Woolley's 1672 book, The Queen-Like Closet.\n\nThis rich and heavy pudding has gone out of fashion over the years due to health and diet consciousness, although  the British chef Heston Blumenthal is trying to revive this type of traditional cookery.\n\nA variant, Currant pond pudding, is known from both Sussex and Kent. \n\nPreparation\n\nWhile cooking, the filling ingredients create a thick, caramelized sauce, which upon serving and cutting of the pudding, runs out and pools around the plate, creating a \u201cpond\u201d.  After cooking for so long, the skin of the lemon almost candies like a marmalade in its own juices and that of the butter and sugar.\n\nThe most authentic recipes call for beef suet for making the pastry which is available in all supermarkets in the UK, but vegetable shortening, or even cold butter, can be substituted for similar results.\n\nThe best lemons to use in this pudding are thin skinned, juicy ones that have not been waxed.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first recorded recipe for the Sussex pond pudding was in Hannah Woolley's The Queen-Like Closet (1672). Woolley suggests encasing a whole apple. \n\nMuch older cookery books and recipes do not actually call for use of a lemon at all.  Here is one found by Florence White: \n\n\u201dThis was given us at Chailey, Sussex, by a nursemaid in 1880 or thereabouts.  It was made for me boiled in a cloth (the correct way) in 1905 by an old cottage woman in the village of Westham.  In Sussex cottages, steak and kidney puddings are still (1931) boiled in a cloth only.\u201d \u2013H.J. Glover\n\nThe first recorded use of a version using a whole lemon was in Jane Grigson's English Food (1974).\n\nIn her A History of English Food, Clarissa Dickson Wright describes the pudding as requiring \"considerable flair to make\", as the cook needs to scratch the lemon \"so that its flavours burst out while it is being cooked.\" She notes also that the Sussex shopkeeper Thomas Turner recorded in his diary of the 1750s and 1760s that he ate variants such as currant pond pudding and plum suet pudding.\nQuestion:\nWhich fruit would you find in the centre of a Sussex Pond Pudding?\nAnswer:\nLemon\nPassage:\nCharolais cattle\nThe Charolais is a breed of taurine beef cattle from the Charolais area surrounding Charolles, in Burgundy, in eastern France. Charolais are raised for meat; they may be crossed with other breeds, including Angus and Hereford cattle. A cross-breed with Brahmans is called Charbray and is recognised as a breed in some countries.\n\nHistory \n\nOutside France\n\nThe breed was introduced to the southern United States from Mexico in 1946.Then later In 1965 it was introduced in the northern New England states from Canada   \n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe breed tends to be large-muscled, with bulls weighing up to 1100 kg and cows up to 900 kg. In England, a bull of this breed has reached a weight of 2 tonnes. \n\nDistribution\n\nThe Charolais is the second-most common cattle breed in France after the Holstein and the most common beef breed, ahead of the  Limousin. France had 4.22 million head of Charolais cattle as of Dec. 31, 2014, including 1.56 million cows, declining 0.6% from a year earlier.  The Charolais is a world breed: it is reported to DAD-IS by 68 countries, of which 37 report population data. The world population is estimated at about 730,000.

Formed in 1976 in London, The Damned were the first British punk band to release a single, an album, have a record hit the UK charts, and tour the United States. With a fluid line-up since their founding, Vanian has been the only ever-present member.\n\nCareer\n\nBorn in Hemel Hempstead, Vanian changed his name from Lett to Vanian in early life after a previous stint as a gravedigger \u2013 Vanian being a play on \"Transylvanian\". He remains one of the early influencers of gothic fashion, wearing dark and otherworldly clothing both on stage and off. He is known to be a fan of renaissance art, film noir and horror movies, all of which manifest in his stage appearance. In November 1976, the British music magazine NME stated that Vanian \"resembles a runaway from the Addams Family\". \n\nIn 1978, he was guest in the song \"Don't Panic England\", from the band Doctors of Madness. In 2004, he and Captain Sensible turned on the Christmas lights in Cambridge, causing some controversy. \n\nVanian sang with the MC5 for their 40th anniversary singing \"Looking at You\", which was released as part of Revolution: A Celebration of the MC5. In 2008, with the band the Throb, played \"Let's Get Lost (Sailor Jerry's Story)\" to the compilation The Original Sailor Jerry Rum \u2013 Music To ........... To.

At 16, he studied under Joan Littlewood and has been an actor since he was 18. \n\nDean's breakthrough performance was playing criminal 'Jack Lynn' in Law And Order (1978). He went on to have roles in television shows such as Minder (1979); Up Pompeii! (1971), Doctor Who (1977); Shoestring (1979); Hammer House of Horror (1980) and The Chinese Detective (1981). In 1980, he played Jeff \"Fangio\" Bateman in Coronation Street and, in 1983, he was cast as Sergeant Jack Wilding in Woodentop  (the Pilot of ITV police drama The Bill).\n\nFilm credits include: Up Pompeii (1971), Murder by Decree (1979), Sweet William (1980), The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980), P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang (1982), and as a bouncer in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (1980).\n\nAt the invitation of producer Julia Smith, he was offered the role of Pete Beale, an original character in the BBC's new soap opera EastEnders; Dean was chosen after the actor who originally auditioned for the role (Leslie Grantham) was selected to play the character Den Watts instead. Dean played the cockney fruit and veg trader from the show's inception in February 1985 until his departure in May 1993. In reality, Dean's contract was terminated following irreconcilable differences with the show's producers. Since his departure, he has publicly slammed the producers for culling his character and did an expos\u00e9 with the Sun newspaper, where he revealed some of the show's secrets and his opinions about former co-stars.  Subsequently, Pete Beale was killed in an off-screen death in episodes that aired in December 1993. Co-star June Brown (who plays Dot Cotton in the show) allegedly quit the show in protest following Dean's sacking in 1993, but returned in 1997. Brown and Dean attempted to set up a production company together, but it did not come to fruition. \n\nSince leaving EastEnders, Dean's television credits have been few, although he has made guest appearances on Channel 4 sketch show Bo' Selecta!, Banzai and Little Britain. He appeared in the Five television show Harry and Cosh in 2002 and regularly appears in pantomimes.

Lowther was succeeded by Andrew Bailey. \n\nSince February 2013, Lowther has been a Deputy Chairman of Co-Operative Banking Group Limited and The Co-operative Bank plc.\nQuestion:\nWhich post was held by Miss Merlyn Lowther from 1999 to 2003?\nAnswer:\nChief Cashier of the Bank of England\nPassage:\nShirley Crabtree\nShirley Crabtree, Jr (14 November 1930 \u2013 2 December 1997), better known as Big Daddy, was an English professional wrestler with a record-breaking 64\u00a0inch chest. He worked for Joint Promotions and the British Wrestling Federation. Initially a villain, he teamed with Giant Haystacks. He later became a fan favourite, working until the 1990s.\n\nProfessional wrestling career \n\nEarly career\n\nCrabtree decided to follow in the footsteps of his father, Shirley Crabtree, Sr., becoming a professional wrestler in 1952. He first became popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a blue-eye billed as \"Blond Adonis Shirley Crabtree.\" He won the European Heavyweight Championship in Joint Promotions and a disputed branch of the British Heavyweight title in the independent British Wrestling Federation before he quit in 1966 following a (non-kayfabe) campaign of harassment by former champion Bert Assirati. He retired for roughly six years.\n\nComeback\n\nIn 1972, Crabtree returned to Joint Promotions as a villain with a gimmick of The Battling Guardsman based on his former service with the Coldstream. It was during this period that he made his first appearances on World of Sport on ITV.\n\nNot long afterwards, Shirley's brother, Max, was appointed as Northern area booker with Joint Promotions and began to transform Crabtree into the persona for which he would be best remembered. Based originally on the character of the same name played by actor Burl Ives in the first screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), 'Big Daddy' was first given life by Crabtree in late 1974, initially still as a villain. The character's leotards were emblazoned with just a large \"D\" and were fashioned by his wife Eunice from their chintz sofa. The character first gained attention in mid-1975 when he formed a tag team with TV newcomer Giant Haystacks. However, during this period, Daddy began to be cheered for the first time since his comeback when he entered into a feud with masked villain Kendo Nagasaki, especially when he unmasked Nagasaki during a televised contest from Solihull in December 1975 (although the unmasked Nagasaki quickly won the bout moments later).\n\nBy the middle of 1977, Daddy had completed his transformation into a blue eye, a change cemented by the breakdown of his tag team with Haystacks and a subsequent feud between the two which would last until the early 1990s. A firm fans' favourite particularly amongst children, Big Daddy came to the ring in either a sequinned cape or a Union Flag jacket and top hat. In addition to his feud with Haystacks, Daddy also feuded with Canadian wrestler 'Mighty' John Quinn. He headlined Wembley Arena with singles matches against Quinn in 1979 and Haystacks in 1981. Later in the 1980s he feuded with Dave \"Fit\" Finlay, Drew McDonald and numerous other villains.\n\nIn August 1987 at the Hippodrome circus in Great Yarmouth, Big Daddy performed in a tag team match pitting himself and nephew Steve Crabtree (billed as \"Greg Valentine\") against King Kong Kirk and King Kendo. After Big Daddy had delivered a splash and pinned King Kong Kirk, rather than selling the impact of the finishing move, Kirk turned an unhealthy colour and was rushed to a nearby hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival. Despite the fact that the inquest into Kirk's death found that he had a serious heart condition and cleared Crabtree of any responsibility, Crabtree was devastated.\n\nHe continued to make regular appearances into the early 1990s, but he eventually retired from wrestling altogether to spend the remainder of his days in his home town of Halifax. During his career, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth II said they were fans of 'Big Daddy'.  \n\nPersonal life \n\nCrabtree was a former rugby league player for league club Bradford Northern. His temper often forced him off the pitch early.  He also had stints as a coal miner and with the British Army's Coldstream Guards.\n\nCrabtree's 64\u00a0inch chest earned him a place in the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nHis brother Brian was a wrestling referee and later MC, while his other brother Max was a booker for \u2013 and later proprietor of \u2013 Joint Promotions. His nephews Steve and Scott Crabtree also had wrestling careers \u2013 Steve wrestled in the 1980s and 1990s, billed as 'Greg Valentine' (named after the American wrestler of the same name) while Scott wrestled as Scott Valentine. Both worked as tag team partners for their uncle. Another nephew Eorl Crabtree is now a Huddersfield and England international rugby league player.\n\nCrabtree died of a stroke in December 1997 in Halifax General Hospital. He was survived by his second wife of 31 years, Eunice and six children. \n\nOther media\n\nBig Daddy had his own comic strip in Buster during the early 1980s drawn by Mike Lacey. In 1982 ITV planned to build a TV programme around 'Big Daddy' as a replacement for the popular children's Saturday morning Tiswas show. A pilot for Big Daddy's Saturday Show was shot and a series announced but Crabtree pulled out at the last moment, leaving the hastily renamed The Saturday Show presented by Isla St Clair and Tommy Boyd.\n\nThe European version of the multi-format game Legends of Wrestling II featured Big Daddy as an exclusive extra Legendary Wrestler.\n\nA stage play by Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon, Big Daddy vs Giant Haystacks premiered at the Brighton Festival Fringe in East Sussex, England between 26\u201328 May 2011 and subsequently toured Great Britain.

Fields and Me' Can Be ...\nMovie Review -    - The Screen:'W .C. Fields and Me' Can Be All Bad - NYTimes.com\nThe Screen:'W .C. Fields and Me' Can Be All Bad\nBy VINCENT CANBY\nPublished: April     1, 1976\nIn his 1937 review of W.C. Fields in \"Poppy,\" Graham Greene wrote \"To watch Mr. Fields, as Dickensian as anything Dickens ever wrote, is a form of escape for poor human creatures . . . who are haunted by pity, by fear, by our sense of right and wrong . . . by conscience. . .\" This prize of escape is the major thing missing from the dreadful new film \"W. C. Fields and Me.\" It holds up a wax dummy of a character intended to represent the great misanthropic comedian and expects us to feel compassion but only traps us in embarrassment.\n\"W. C. Fields and Me,\" which opened yesterday at three theaters, is based on the memoir written by Carlotta Monti, Fields's mistress for the last 14 years of his life. The book, written with Cy Rice, is gushy, foolish and self-serving, which is probably understandable.\nTo expect it to be anything else, I suppose, would be to look for the definitive analysis of the Cuban missile crisis in a memoir by a White House cook. Yet the movie needn't have been quite as brainless as it is. That took work.\nFirst off, Bob Merrill, who has written either the lyrics or music (sometimes both) for some good Broadway shows, including \"New Girl in Town,\" has supplied a screenplay that originally may have been meant as the outline for a musical. It exhibits a tell-tale disregard for facts and the compulsion to make a dramatically shapeless life fit into a two-act form. The mind that attends to this sort of hack business would cast Raquel Welsh in the title role of \"The Life and Loves of Bliss Carman.\"\nThen there's Arthur Hiller, a director who makes intelligent films when the material is right (\"Hospital,\" \"The Americanization of Emily\") and terrible ones when the writers fail.\nMost prominent in the mess is Rod Steiger, who has been got up in a false nose and dyed hair in a way meant to make him look like Fields, which he does (sort of though he reminds me much more of the way Fields's one-time co-star, Mae West, looked in \"Myra Breckinridge.\" The exterior is pure plastic, though occasionally one sees a sign of individual life deep inside the two holes that have been cut out for the eyes.\nThe film opens in the 1920's in New York, when Fields was already a big Ziegfeld star, and closes with his death in California in 1946, at the age of 67, when he had become one of Hollywood's most celebrated stars. In between these dates \"W.C. Fields and Me\" attempts to dramatize\u2014with no conviction\u2014the complex, witty actor-writer as if he were one of his own ill-tempered, suspicious heroes with a suddenly discovered heart of gold.\nMr. Steiger reads all of his lines with the monotonous sing-song manner used by third-rate nightclub comics doing Fields imitations. He also speaks most of them out of the corner of his mouth as if he'd had a stroke.\nValerie Perrine, a spectacularly beautiful woman who may also be a good actress, plays Miss Monti, who, in this film anyway, is an unconvincing combination of intelligence, patience, fidelity, sportsmanship and masochism. Perhaps because the visual style of the entire film is more or less mortuous, Jack Cassidy, who plays a flyweight John Barrymore, wears the kind of makeup that makes him look dead several reels before he actually dies.\nThe movie contains two halfway funny moments: a scene in which we see Fields taking a broom to a swan that has trespassed his Hollywood lawn, and the sight of Baby Harold (based on Baby Leroy, one of Fields's toughest costars) staggering out of his set-side dressing room after Fields has spiked the kid's orange juice with gin.\nW.C. FIELDS AND ME, directed by Arthur Hiller; screenplay by Bob Merrill, based on the book by Carlotta Monti with Cy Rice; produced by Jay Weston; director of photography, David M. Walsh; editor, John C. Howard; music, Henry Mancini; distributed by Universal Pictures. Running time: 110 minutes. At the Criterion Theater, Broadway at 45th Street, Baronet Theater, 34th Street near Second Avenue. This film has been rated PG.\nW.C. Fields . . . . .

She joined the SOE in revenge for her godmother's father having been shot by the Nazis,  officially joining on 1 November 1943 and was commissioned as an Honorary Section Officer.\n\nShe parachuted into Orne, Normandy on 1 May 1944 to operate as part of the Scientist circuit, using the codename Genevieve to work as a wireless operator with the organiser Claude de Baissac and his sister Lis\u00e9 de Baissac (the courier).  She worked successfully and largely avoiding detection of the Germans, she sent over 135 messages to London, remaining in France until the liberation in August 1944.\n\nPost World War II\n\nAfter World War II, Latour married an engineer with the surname Doyle, and went to live in Kenya (East Africa),  Fiji, and Australia. She now lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nHonours and awards\n\nLatour was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour (Knight of the Legion of Honour), by the French government on 29 November 2014, as part of the 70th anniversary of the battle of Normandy.  \n\nNotes\nQuestion:\n\"In 2014 at the age of 93 Phyllis Latour Doyle, \"\"Pippa\"\", received the Chevalier de l'Ordre National de la Legion d'Honneur, (the Legion of Honour, knight class) for activities in occupied France in World War II; where was she born, and where did she grow up?\"\nAnswer:\nSouth africa\nPassage:\nL\u00e6rdal Tunnel\nL\u00e6rdal Tunnel () is a  long road tunnel connecting L\u00e6rdal and Aurland in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway and located approximately 175 \u2013 north-east of Bergen. It is the longest road tunnel in the world succeeding the Swiss Gotthard Road Tunnel. The tunnel carries two lanes of European Route E16 and represents the final link on the new main highway connecting Oslo and Bergen without ferry connections and difficult mountain crossings during winter.\n\nIn 1975, the Parliament of Norway decided that the main road between Oslo and Bergen would run via Filefjell. In 1992, Parliament confirmed that decision, made the further decision that the road should run through a tunnel between L\u00e6rdal and Aurland, and passed legislation to build the tunnel. Construction started in 1995 and the tunnel opened in 2000. It cost 1.082 billion Norwegian krone ($113.1M USD). \n\nDesign\n\nA total of 2500000 m3 of rock was removed from the tunnel during its construction from 1995 to 2000.  The tunnel begins just east of Aurlandsvangen in Aurland and goes through a mountain range and ends  south of L\u00e6rdals\u00f8yri in L\u00e6rdal.  The design of the tunnel takes into consideration the mental strain on drivers, so the tunnel is divided into four sections, separated by three large mountain caves at 6 km intervals.  While the main tunnel has white lights, the caves have blue lighting with yellow lights at the fringes to give an impression of sunrise.   The caves are meant to break the routine, providing a refreshing view and allowing drivers to take a short rest.  The caverns are also used as turn around points and for break areas to help lift claustrophobia during a 20-minute drive through the tunnel.  To keep drivers from being inattentive or falling asleep, each lane is supplied with a loud rumble strip towards the centre.\n\nSafety\n\nThe tunnel does not have emergency exits. In case of accidents and/or fire, many safety precautions have been made.  There are emergency phones marked \"SOS\" every 250 m which can contact the police, fire departments, and hospitals.  Fire extinguishers have been placed every 125 m.  Whenever an emergency phone in the tunnel is used or a fire extinguisher is lifted, stop lights and electronic signs reading: snu og k\u00f8yr ut () are displayed throughout the tunnel and 2 other electronic signs on both sides of the entrance reading: tunnelen stengt  (English: Tunnel closed).  There are 15 turning areas which were constructed for buses and semi-trailers.  In addition to the three large caverns, emergency niches have been built every 500 m.  There are photo inspections and counting of all vehicles that enter and exit the tunnel at security centres in L\u00e6rdal and Bergen.  There is also special wiring in the tunnel for the use of radio and mobile phones.  Speed cameras have been installed  because of serious speeding (there are very few other completely straight roads in the region).\n\nAir quality\n\nHigh air quality in the tunnel is achieved in two ways: ventilation and purification. Large fans draw air in from both entrances, and polluted air is expelled through the ventilation tunnel to Tynjadalen. The L\u00e6rdal Tunnel is the first in the world to be equipped with an air treatment plant, located in a 100 m wide cavern about  northwest of Aurlandsvangen.  The plant removes both dust and nitrogen dioxide from the tunnel air. Two large fans draw air through the treatment plant, where dust and soot are removed by an electrostatic filter. Then the air is drawn through a large carbon filter which removes the nitrogen dioxide.\nQuestion:\nIn which country is the Laerdal Tunnel, the longest road tunnel in the world?\nAnswer:\nNorv\u00e8ge\nPassage:\nAlis volat propriis\nAlis volat propriis is a Latin phrase used as the motto of U.S. state of Oregon. \n\nThe official English version of the motto is \"She flies with her own wings\" in keeping with the tradition of considering countries and territories to be feminine.  However, because the feminine pronoun in the Latin sentences is often omitted and the verb form is not inflected for gender, the phrase could be translated with equal validity as \"[one] flies with [one's] own wings\" or \"[it] flies with [its] own wings\". \n\nIf macrons are used to indicate the long vowels (standard practice in Latin dictionaries and textbooks), then the phrase becomes \u0100l\u012bs volat propri\u012bs.\n\nThe motto was written in English by judge Jesse Quinn Thornton, and its Latin translation was added to the Territorial Seal adopted by the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1854.  The motto referred to the May 2, 1843 vote by Oregon Country settlers at the third Champoeg Meeting to form a provisional government independent of the United States and Great Britain. During the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865 the motto on the state seal was changed to \"The Union.\"Lansing, Ronald B. 2005. Nimrod: Courts, Claims, and Killing on the Oregon Frontier. Pullman: Washington State University Press. p. 90, 136-40, 262. In 1957, the Oregon Legislature officially changed the motto to \"The Union\" reflecting conflicting views about slavery in Oregon's early days.\n\nIn 1987, the legislature readopted the original motto, which it felt better reflected Oregon's independent spirit. The sponsors of the bill that changed the motto back to alis volat propriis included the Oregon Secretary of State and later Governor Barbara Roberts, President of the Oregon Senate Jason Boe, and Senate historian Cecil Edwards.\n\nIn 1999, after a short debate in committee, the Oregon House of Representatives took a vote on HB 2269, which would revert the state motto to \"The Union\". The bill failed to pass on a 30-30 tie vote. \n\nThe current Oregon State Seal, which appears on the obverse of the state flag, still features the motto \"The Union.\"\nQuestion:\nFeb 14, 1859 saw what state, with an offical motto that translates as \"She Flies With Her Own Wings\", join the union as the 33rd?\nAnswer:\nDemographics of Oregon\nPassage:\nMattock\nA mattock is a versatile hand tool, used for digging and chopping, similar to the pickaxe. It has a long handle, and a stout head, which combines an axe blade and an adze (cutter mattock) or a pick and an adze (pick mattock).\n\nDescription\n\nA mattock has a shaft, typically made of wood, which is about 3 - long.  The head comprises two ends, opposite each other, and separated by a central eye; a mattock head typically weighs 3 -. The form of the head determines its identity and its use:\n\n*The head of a pick mattock combines a pick and an adze. It is \"one of the best tools for grubbing in hard soils and rocky terrain\".  The adze may be sharpened, but the pick rarely is; it is generally squared rather than beveled.\n*The head of a cutter mattock combines an axe with an adze. Thus, it has two flat blades, facing away from each other, and one rotated 90\u00b0 relative to the other. The blade is designed to be used for cutting through roots.\n\nThe handle of a mattock fits into the oval eye in the head, and is fixed by striking the head end of the handle against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, a rock or firm ground. The head end of the handle is tapered outwards, and the oval opening in the iron tool is similarly tapered so that the head will never fly off when in use.  The mattock blade ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, so that it will not slide  down and hit the user's hands.  The mattock is meant for swinging between one's legs, as in digging a ditch with one foot on either side.  Tapping the handle end on the ground while holding the head  allows the handle to be removed. In the eastern United States, mattock handles are often fitted with a screw below the head and parallel with it, to prevent the head slipping down the handle; in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done.\n\nUses\n\nMattocks are \"the most versatile of hand-planting tools\". They can be used to chop into the ground with the adze and pull the soil towards the user, opening a slit to plant into.  They can also be used to dig holes for planting into, and are particularly useful where there is a thick layer of matted sod. The use of a mattock can be tiring because of the effort needed to drive the blade into the ground, and the amount of bending and stooping involved.\n\nThe adze of a mattock is useful for digging or hoeing, especially in hard soil.\n\nCutter mattocks () are used in rural Africa for removing stumps from fields, including unwanted banana suckers. \n\nThe mattock was most likely the main murder weapon when six people were killed in the brutal murders in Hinterkaifeck.\n\nHistory\n\nAs a simple but effective tool, mattocks have a long history. Their shape was already established by the Bronze Age in Asia Minor and Ancient Greece.,  and mattocks () were the most commonly depicted tool in Byzantine manuscripts of Hesiod's Works and Days. \n\nMattocks made from antlers first appear in the British Isles in the Late Mesolithic. They were probably used chiefly for digging, and may have been related to the rise of agriculture.  Mattocks made of whalebone were used for tasks including flensing \u2013 stripping blubber from the carcass of a whale \u2013 by the broch people of Scotland and by the Inuit. \n\nEtymology\n\nThe word mattock is of unclear origin; one theory traces it from Proto-Germanic, from Proto-Indo-European (see Wiktionary). There are no clear cognates in other Germanic languages, and similar words in various Celtic languages are borrowings from the English (e.g. , , ).  However, there are proposed cognates in Old High German and Middle High German, and more speculatively with words in Balto-Slavic languages, including Old Church Slavonic ' and Lithuanian ', and even Sanskrit. It may be cognate to or derived from the unattested Vulgar Latin ', meaning club or cudgel. The New English Dictionary of 1906 interpreted mattock as a diminutive, but there is no root to derive it from, and no semantic reason for the diminutive formation. Forms such as mathooke, motthook and mathook were produced by folk etymology. Although used to prepare whale blubber, which the Inuit call \"mattaq\", no such connection is known. \n\nWhile the noun \"mattock\" is attested from Old English onwards, the transitive verb \"to mattock\" or \"to mattock up\" first appeared in the mid-17th century.\nQuestion:\nA mattock (alternatively called a dibber in some countries) is used mainly for?\nAnswer:\nDig\nPassage:\nWashboard (musical instrument)\nThe washboard and frottoir (from Cajun French \"frotter\", to rub) are used as a percussion instrument, employing the ribbed metal surface of the cleaning device as a rhythm instrument. As traditionally used in jazz, zydeco, skiffle, jug band, and old-time music, the washboard remained in its wooden frame and is played primarily by tapping, but also scraping the washboard with thimbles. Often the washboard has additional traps, such as a wood block, a cowbell, and even small cymbals. Conversely, the frottoir (zydeco rubboard) dispenses with the frame and consists simply of the metal ribbing hung around the neck. It is played primarily with spoon handles or bottle openers in a combination of strumming, scratching, tapping and rolling.  The frottoir or vest frottoir is played as a stroked percussion instrument, often in a band with a drummer, while the washboard generally is a replacement for drums. In Zydeco bands, the frottoir is usually played with bottle openers, to make a louder sound. It tends to play counter-rhythms to the drummer. In a jug band, the washboard can also be stroked with a single whisk broom and functions as the drums for the band, playing only on the back-beat for most songs, a substitute for a snare drum. In a four-beat measure, the washboard will stroke on the 2-beat and the 4-beat. Its best sound is achieved using a single steel-wire snare-brush or whisk broom.  However, in a jazz setting, the washboard can also be played with thimbles on all fingers, tapping out much more complex rhythms, as in The Washboard Rhythm Kings, a full-sized band, and Newman Taylor Baker.\n\nThere are three general ways of deploying the washboard for use as an instrument. The first, mainly used by American players like Washboard Chaz of the Washboard Chaz Blues Trio and Ralf Reynolds of the Reynolds Brothers Rhythm Rascals, is to drape it vertically down the chest. The second, used by European players like David Langlois of the Blue Vipers of Brooklyn and Stephane Seva of Paris Washboard, is to hold it horizontally across the lap, or, for more complex setups, to mount it horizontally on a purpose-built stand. The third (and least common) method, used by Washboard Sam and Deryck Guyler, is to hold it in a perpendicular orientation between the legs while seated, so that both sides of the board might be played at the same time.\n\nThere is a Polish traditional jazz festival and music award named \"Z\u0142ota Tarka\" (Golden Washboard).  Washboards, called \"zatulas\", are also occasionally used in Ukrainian folk music.\n\nHistory\n\nThe washboard as a percussion instrument ultimately derives from the practice of hamboning as practiced in West Africa and brought to the new world by African slaves.   This led to the development of Jug bands which used jugs, spoons, and washboards to provide the rhythm.   Jug bands became popular in the 1920s.\n\nThe frottoir, also called a Zydeco rub-board, is a mid-20th century invention designed specifically for Zydeco music.  It is one of the few musical instruments invented entirely in the United States and represents a distillation of the washboard into essential elements (percussive surface with shoulder straps).  It was designed in 1946 by Clifton Chenier and fashioned by Willie Landry, a friend and metalworker at the Texaco refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. Clifton's brother Cleveland Chenier famously played this newly designed rubboard using bottle openers. Likewise, Willie's son, Tee Don Landry, continues the traditional hand manufacturing of rubboards in his small shop in Sunset, Louisiana, between Lafayette and Opelousas. \n\nIn 2010 Saint Blues Guitar Workshop launched an electric washboard percussion instrument called the Woogie Board. \n\nWell known washboard musicians\n\nIn British Columbia, Canada, Tony McBride, known as \"Mad Fingers McBride\", performs with a group called The Genuine Jug Band. Tony is referred to as \"The Canadian Washboard King\". His percussion set-up was created by Douglas Fraser, of the same band. The washboard set-up was seen in Modern Drummer magazine, August 2014 edition.\n\nMusician Steve Katz famously played washboard with the Even Dozen Jug Band.  His playing can be heard on the group\u2019s legendary self-titled Elektra recording from 1964. Katz reprised his washboard playing on Played a Little Fiddle, a 2007 recording featuring Steve Katz, Stefan Grossman and Danny Kalb. Katz's washboard approach is notable as he plays the instrument horizontally. Additionally, Katz uses fingerpicks instead of thimbles.\n\nDuring their early years, Mungo Jerry frequently featured washboard on stage and on record, played by Joe Rush.\n\nJim \"Dandy\" Mangrum, lead singer of Southern rock band Black Oak Arkansas, is well known for incorporating the washboard into many of the band's songs, notably \"When Electricity Came to Arkansas.\"  Self taught Elizabeth Bougerol has made the washboard a key element of The Hot Sardines jazz band.\n\nCody Dickinson, a member of hill country blues bands the North Mississippi Allstars and Country Hill Revue plays an electrified washboard on a self-written track, \"Psychedelic Sex Machine\". The song is almost entirely centered around the sound of the washboard, captured by a small clip-on microphone. The sound is then sent through a wah-wah and other effects pedals to create a fresher, more innovative and up-to-date sound for the washboard. A frottoir is played with a stroking instrument (usually with spoon handles or a pair of bottle-openers) in each hand. In a 4-beat measure, the frottoir will be stroked 8 to 16 times. It plays more like a Latin percussion instrument, rather than as a drum. The rhythms used are often similar to those played on Guiro.\n\nActor Deryck Guyler was well known for his washboard-playing skills.\nQuestion:\nA washboard scraped with a thimble features as an instrument in what kind of music?\nAnswer:\nSkiffle band\nPassage:\nCell division\nCell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.  Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis),  and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half, to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions: homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the second division.  Both of these cell division cycles are used in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle, and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.  Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission, where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication.\n\nFor simple unicellular organismsSingle cell organisms. See discussion within lead of the article on microorganism. such as the amoeba, one cell division is equivalent to reproduction \u2013 an entire new organism is created. On a larger scale, mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms, such as plants that grow from cuttings. Cell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from the one-celled zygote, which itself was produced by cell division from gametes. And after growth, cell division allows for continual construction and repair of the organism.  A human being's body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime. \n\nThe primary concern of cell division is the maintenance of the original cell's genome. Before division can occur, the genomic information that is stored in chromosomes must be replicated, and the duplicated genome must be separated cleanly between cells. A great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved in keeping genomic information consistent between \"generations\".\n\nVariants\n\nCells are classified into two main categories: simple, non-nucleated prokaryotic cells, and complex, nucleated eukaryotic cells. Owing to their structural differences, eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells do not divide in the same way. Also, the pattern of cell division that transforms eukaryotic stem cells into gametes (sperm cells in males or ova \u2013 egg cells \u2013 in females) is different from that of the somatic cell division in the cells of the body.\n\nDegradation\n\nMulticellular organisms replace worn-out cells through cell division. In some animals, however, cell division eventually halts. In humans this occurs on average, after 52 divisions, known as the Hayflick limit. The cell is then referred to as senescent. Cells stop dividing because the telomeres, protective bits of DNA on the end of a chromosome required for replication, shorten with each copy, eventually being consumed. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are not thought to degrade in this way, if at all. An enzyme called telomerase, present in large quantities in cancerous cells, rebuilds the telomeres, allowing division to continue indefinitely.\nQuestion:\nWhat divides in two in a process called mitosis?\nAnswer:\nCellular processes\nPassage:\nPelisse\nA pelisse was originally a short fur lined or fur trimmed jacket that was usually worn hanging loose over the left shoulder of hussar light cavalry soldiers, ostensibly to prevent sword cuts. The name was also applied to a fashionable style of woman's coat worn in the early 19th century.\n\nMilitary uniform\n\nThe style of uniform incorporating the pelisse originated with the Hussar mercenaries of Hungary in the 17th Century. As this type of light cavalry unit became popular in Western Europe, so too did their dress. In the 19th century pelisses were in use throughout most armies in Europe, and even some in North and South America.\n\nIn appearance the pelisse was characteristically a very short and extremely tight fitting (when worn) jacket, the cuffs and collar of which were trimmed with fur. The jacket was further decorated with patterns sewn in bullion lace. The front of the jacket was distinctive and featured several rows of parallel frogging and loops, and either three or five lines of buttons. For officers of the British Hussars this frogging, regimentally differentiated, was generally of gold or silver bullion lace, to match either gold (gilt) or silver buttons. Other ranks had either yellow lace with brass buttons or white lace with 'white-metal' buttons. Lacing varied from unit to unit and country to country. The pelisse was usually worn slung over the left shoulder, in the manner of a short cloak, over a jacket of similar style - but without the fur lining or trim - called a dolman jacket. It was held in place by a lanyard. In cold weather the pelisse could be worn over the dolman.\n \nThe prevalence of this style began to wane towards the end of the 19th Century, but it was still in use by some cavalry regiments in the Imperial German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies up until World War I. The two hussar regiments of the Spanish Army retained pelisses until 1931. The Danish Garderhusarregimentet are  the only modern military unit to retain this distinctive item of dress, as part of their mounted full-dress uniform. \n\nLadies fashion\n\nIn early 19th-century Europe, when military clothing was often used as inspiration for fashionable ladies' garments, the term was applied to a woman's long, fitted coat with set-in sleeves and the then-fashionable Empire waist. Although initially these Regency-era pelisses copied the Hussars' fur and braid, they soon lost these initial associations, and in fact were often made entirely of silk and without fur at all. They did, however, tend to retain traces of their military inspiration with frog fastenings and braid trim.\nPelisses lost even this superficial resemblance to their origins as skirts and sleeves widened in the 1830s, and the increasingly enormous crinolines of the 1840s and '50s caused fashionable women to turn to loose mantles, cloaks, and shawls instead.\nQuestion:\nA pelisse is what type of garment?\nAnswer:\nKinikini\nPassage:\nCape Matapan\nCape Matapan (, or \u039c\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac in the Maniot dialect), also named as Cape Tainaron (), or Cape Tenaro, is situated at the end of the Mani Peninsula, Greece. Cape Matapan is the southernmost point of mainland Greece, and the second southernmost point in mainland Europe. It separates the Messenian Gulf in the west from the Laconian Gulf in the east.\n\nHistory\n\nCape Matapan has been an important place for thousands of years. The tip of Cape Matapan was the site of the ancient town Tenarus, near which there was (and still is) a cave that Greek legends claim was the home of Hades, the god of the dead. The ancient Spartans built several temples there, dedicated to various gods.  On the hill situated above the cave, lie the remnants of an ancient temple dedicated to the sea god Poseidon (\u039d\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2).  Under the Byzantine Empire, the temple was converted into a Christian church, and Christian rites are conducted there to this day. Cape Matapan was once the place where mercenaries waited to be employed.\n\nAt Cape Matapan, the Titanic's would-be rescue ship, the SS Californian, was torpedoed and sunk by German forces on 9\u00a0November 1915. In March 1941, a major naval battle, the Battle of Cape Matapan, occurred off the coast of Cape Matapan, between the Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina, in which the British emerged victorious in a one-sided encounter. The encounter's main result was to drastically reduce future Italian naval activity in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nMore recently a lighthouse was constructed, but it is now in disuse.\n \nAs the southernmost point of mainland Greece, the cape is on the migration route of birds headed to Africa.\nQuestion:\nIn which country is Cape Matapan?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nAn Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews\nAn Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews, or simply Shamela, as it is more commonly known, is a satirical burlesque, a novella written by Henry Fielding, first published in April 1741 under the name of Mr. Conny Keyber. Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.\n\nPublishing history\n\nShamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.\n\nA pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.\n\nPlot summary\n\nShamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.\n\nThemes and style\n\nThe novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  \n\nRichardson's epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her 'virtue' to battle against her master's attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message \u2013 that a girl's chastity has eventual value as a commodity \u2013 as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding's travesty.\n\nRecent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding's work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson's work, rather than a simple attack.  Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews.\nQuestion:\n\u2018Shamela\u2019 (1741) was a parody of \u2018Pamela\u2019 (1740). Who wrote the latter?\nAnswer:\nSamuel Richardson\nPassage:\nCalcaneus\nIn humans, the calcaneus (; from the Latin calcaneus or calcaneum, meaning heel ) or heel bone is a bone of the tarsus of the foot which constitutes the heel.  In some other animals, it is the point of the hock.\n\nStructure\n\nIn humans, the calcaneus is the largest of the tarsal bones and the largest bone of the foot. The talus bone, calcaneus, and navicular bone are considered the proximal row of tarsal bones. In the calcaneus, several important structures can be distinguished: \n\nThe half of the bone closest to the heel is the calcaneal tubercle. On its lower edge on either side are its lateral and medial processes (serving as the origins of the abductor hallucis and abductor digiti minimi).  The Achilles tendon is inserted into a roughened area on its superior side, the cuboid bone articulates with its anterior side, and on its superior side are three articular surfaces for the articulation with the talus bone.  Between these superior articulations and the equivalents on the talus is the tarsal sinus (a canal occupied by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament). At the upper and forepart of the medial surface of the calcaneus, below the middle talar facet, there is a horizontal eminence, the talar shelf (also sustentaculum tali), which gives attachment to the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament, tibiocalcaneal ligament, and medial talocalcaneal ligament. This eminence is concave above, and articulates with the middle calcaneal articular surface of the talus; below, it is grooved for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus; its anterior margin gives attachment to the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, and its medial margin to a part of the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint.\n\nOn the lateral side is commonly a tubercle called the calcaneal tubercle (or trochlear process). This is a raised projection located between the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. It separates the two oblique grooves of the lateral surface of the calcaneus (for the tendons of the peroneal muscles).\n\nIts chief anatomical significance is as a point of divergence of the previously common pathway shared by the distal tendons of peroneus longus and peroneus brevis en route to their distinct respective attachment sites.\n\nThe calcaneus is part of two joints: the proximal intertarsal joint and the talocalcaneal joint. The point of the calcaneus is covered by the calcanean bursa.\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn the calcaneus, an ossification center is developed during the 4th\u20137th week of fetal development.\n\nFunction\n\nThree muscles attach to the calcaneus: the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris. These muscles are part of the posterior compartment of the leg and aid in walking, running and jumping. Their specific functions include plantarflexion of the foot, flexion of the knee, and steadying the leg on the ankle during standing.\n\nClinical significance\n\nNormally the tibia sits vertically above the calcaneus (pes rectus). If the calcaneal axis between these two bones is turned medially the foot is in an everted position (pes valgus), and if it is turned laterally the foot is in an inverted position (pes varus). \n\n*Calcaneal fracture, also known as Lover's fracture and Don Juan fracture\n\nDisease\n\nThe talar shelf is typically involved in subtalar or talocalcaneal tarsal coalition.\nQuestion:\nWhere is the calcaneus bone?\nAnswer:\nHeels\nPassage:\nAichmophobia\nAichmophobia (pronounced [\u012bk-m\u014d-f\u014d\u2032b\u0113-\u0103]) is a kind of specific phobia, the morbid fear of sharp things,  such as pencils, needles, knives, a pointing finger, or even the sharp end of an umbrella and different sorts of protruding corners or sharp edges in furnitures and building constructions/materials. It is derived from the Greek aichm\u0113 (point) and phobos (fear). This fear may also be referred to as belonephobia or enetophobia.\n\nSometimes this general term is used to refer to what is more specifically called fear of needles, or needle phobia. Fear of needles is the extreme and irrational fear of medical procedures involving injections or hypodermic needles.\n\nNot to be confused with similar condition (Avoidance behavior) the Visual looming syndrome, where the patient does not fear sharp items, but feels pain or discomfort at gazing upon sharp objects nearby.\n\nTreatment \n\nHypnotherapy \n\nThe use of hypnotherapy which is a combination of hypnosis and therapeutic intervention, may help to control or improve the fear of sharp objects, specifically needles.  A technique called systematic desensitization exposes patients to the feared stimuli in gradual degrees while under hypnosis.  This technique has met with mixed levels of success. \n\nDirect conditioning \n\nDirect conditioning is a process used to associate desired behaviour in the subject with positive stimuli. Mary Cover Jones conducted an experiment in which she treated a patient with a fear of rabbits, by gradually moving a rabbit closer to the patient in the presence of the patient's favorite food. This continued until the patient was able to touch the rabbit without fear.  \n\nRare cases causing posttraumatic stress \n\nIn rare cases, exposure to the feared object may cause posttraumatic stress disorder, which again increases the fear of the object as one also gets afraid of getting posttramatic stress. Typically, this is caused by the fear of a small fragment of the feared object getting stuck in the body after exposure.\nQuestion:\nIn medicine, belonephobia is an irrational fear of what?\nAnswer:\nNeedle (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nTenko (TV series)\nTenko  is a television drama, co-produced by the BBC and the ABC.  A total of thirty episodes were produced over three series between 1981 and 1984, followed by a one-off special (which was twice the length of the other episodes), Tenko Reunion, in 1985.\n\nThe series dealt with the experiences of British, Australian and Dutch women who were captured after the Fall of Singapore in February 1942, after the Japanese invasion, and held in a Japanese internment camp on a Japanese-occupied island between Singapore and Australia. Having been separated from their husbands, herded into makeshift holding camps and largely forgotten by the British War Office, the women have to learn to cope with appalling living conditions, malnutrition, disease, violence and death.\n\nBackground\n\nTenko was created by Lavinia Warner after she had conducted research into the internment of nursing corps officer Margot Turner (1910\u20131993) for an edition of This Is Your Life and was convinced of the dramatic potential of the stories of women prisoners of the Japanese.  Aside from the first two episodes, set in Singapore, which were written by Paul Wheeler, the series was written by Jill Hyem and Anne Valery.\n\nOwing to high production costs, only the first two episodes of the first series were filmed on location in Singapore. For the majority of series 1 and 2, set in the camp, the programme was filmed in a specially constructed set in Dorset. Hankley Common was also used. \n\nThe series takes its name from the Japanese word \"tenko\" (\u70b9\u547c/\u3066\u3093\u3053) which means \"roll-call\".  POWs and internees in Japanese-run camps had regular roll-calls, where they had to line up and number off or were counted in Japanese.\n\nMajor characters\n\nThe major characters who featured in all three series and the reunion telemovie were:\n*Marion Jefferson (Ann Bell)\u2014the wife of an army colonel.\n*Beatrice Mason (Stephanie Cole)\u2014a stern, officious doctor.\n*Kate Norris (Claire Oberman)\u2014a brash Australian nurse.\n*Domenica Van Meyer (Elizabeth Chambers)\u2014a vain, selfish Dutch woman.\n*Christina Campbell (Emily Bolton)\u2014a mixed-race (Chinese/Scottish) young woman.\n*Dorothy Bennett (Veronica Roberts)\u2014a young working-class housewife.\n*Sister Ulrica (Patricia Lawrence)\u2014a formidable Dutch nun.\n\nOnly Ann Bell, Stephanie Cole and Claire Oberman appeared in all thirty regular episodes plus the reunion. Episodes were missed by Elizabeth Chambers in Series 1, Emily Bolton in Series 2, Veronica Roberts in Series 1 and 3 and Patricia Lawrence in Series 2 and 3.\n\nDVD release and books\n\nAll three series plus the Reunion Special were released in one DVD box-set in 2011 through Acorn Media UK.\n\nThree paperback books were published in the 1980s. One covering the first series, titled Tenko, while a second called Last Tenko, covered the second and final series. The third book, written by Anne Valery, covered the Reunion. \n\nA book about the making of Tenko called Remembering Tenko by Andy Priestner was published in October 2012.\nQuestion:\nWhat did the term 'Tenko' mean in Japanese prisoner of war camps?\nAnswer:\nRole call\nPassage:\nBritain's smallest songbird decling - Telegraph\nBritain's smallest songbird decling - Telegraph\nWildlife\nBritain's smallest songbird decling\nBritain's smallest bird was almost wiped out by the cold weather this winter,    according to a new survey that found the number of gardens in which    goldcrests were spotted fell by half.\nThe goldcrest saw numbers plummet by three quarters.\u00a0\nBy Louise Gray\n12:54PM BST 16 Jun 2010\nThe declines in the tiny bird, which at just 6g weighs less than a 10p piece, were seen throughout the UK and Ireland as the region battled with the coldest winter for several decades.\nAcross the British Isles, goldcrests were seen in 48 per cent fewer gardens between January and March than on average, with declines reaching 60 per cent in Scotland, the South West and the east of England. The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) said the reduction in the number of gardens where goldcrests were resident over the winter month was an \"early warning\" of possible major declines in the population as a whole - as gardens would be expected to be a refuge for the birds.\nIn winter, they visit gardens in larger numbers to feed on fat-based foods put out by householders, and in the unusually snowy and icy conditions which gripped the UK and Ireland earlier this year they would be expected to be seen in more gardens.\nThe BTO warned the declines in goldcrests in gardens between January and March, observed by people taking part in its year-round weekly Garden BirdWatch, suggest a crash in the population at large.\nDr Tim Harrison, of BTO Garden BirdWatch, said goldcrests were not able to carry much in the way of food reserves and as a result were vulnerable to starvation.\nRelated Articles\nQuestion:\nWhich is Britain's smallest songbird?\nAnswer:\nGoldcrests\nPassage:\nTonic water\nTonic water (or Indian tonic water) is a carbonated soft drink in which quinine is dissolved. Originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, tonic water usually now has a significantly lower quinine content and is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavour. It is often used in mixed drinks, particularly in gin and tonic.\n\nHistory \n\nThe drink gained its name from the effects of its bitter flavouring. The quinine was added to the drink as a prophylactic against malaria, since it was originally intended for consumption in tropical areas of South Asia and Africa, where the disease is endemic. Quinine powder was so bitter that British officials stationed in early 19th Century India and other tropical posts began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858.  The mixed drink gin and tonic also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with gin. \n\nSince 2010, at least four tonic syrups have been released in the United States. Consumers add carbonated water to the syrup to make tonic water; this allows drinkers to vary the intensity of the flavour. \n\nQuinine content \n\nMedicinal tonic water originally contained only carbonated water and a large amount of quinine. However, most tonic water today contains a less significant amount of quinine, and is thus used mostly for its flavor. As a consequence, it is less bitter, and is also usually sweetened, often with high fructose corn syrup or sugar. Some manufacturers also produce diet (or slimline) tonic water, which may contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. Traditional-style tonic water with little more than quinine and carbonated water is less common, but may be preferred by those who desire the bitter flavor.\n\nIn the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limits the quinine content in tonic water to 83 ppm  (83\u00a0mg per liter if calculated by mass), while the daily therapeutic dose of quinine is in the range of 500\u20131000\u00a0mg,  and 10\u00a0mg/kg every eight hours for effective malaria prevention (2100\u00a0mg daily for a 70\u00a0kg adult).  Still, it is often recommended as a relief for leg cramps, but medical research suggests some care is needed in monitoring doses.  Because of quinine's risks, the FDA cautions consumers against using \"off-label\" quinine drugs to treat leg cramps. \n\nUses \n\nTonic water is often used as a drink mixer for cocktails, especially those made with gin or vodka (for example, a gin and tonic). Tonic water with lemon or lime flavour added is known as bitter lemon or bitter lime, respectively. Such soft drinks are more popular in the United Kingdom and Europe than in the United States.\n\nFluorescence \n\nTonic water will fluoresce under ultraviolet light, owing to the presence of quinine. In fact, the sensitivity of quinine to ultraviolet light is such that it will appear visibly fluorescent in direct sunlight.\nQuestion:\nWhich drug can be found in tonic water?\nAnswer:\nChinin\nPassage:\nThe Miracles of Jesus Christ: Water Into Wine (Part One)\nThe Miracles of Jesus Christ: Water Into Wine (Part One)\nThe Miracles of Jesus Christ:\nWater Into Wine (Part One)\nby Martin G. Collins\nForerunner, \"Bible Study,\" November 2006\n2006-11-01\nThe Miracles of Jesus Christ\nseries:\nMore...\nThe first miracle Jesus Christ performs during His ministry is changing water into wine at a marriage feast in Cana ( John 2:1-11 ). When we compare what Christ and Moses each did with water, Jesus' miracle shows the contrast between law and grace. Moses changes water to blood, and Christ changes it into wine. Earlier, in John 1:17 , the apostle John writes, \"For the law was given through Moses, [and] grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\" Moses' turning of water into blood suggests judgment ( Exodus 7:14-17 ), while Jesus' turning of water into wine implies generosity and joy. In John 3:17 , John comments, \"For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world [what the law does to sinners], but that the world through Him might be saved [what grace does for those who repent].\"\nThis miracle demonstrates at the earliest possible time that Christ's ministry would be one of grace and truth, as an extension and complement of the Law and the Prophets ( Matthew 5:17-19 ). Jesus had come to fulfill God's law, that is, to teach it and live it as an example of how to apply it to everyday life ( Luke 24:44-45 ).\n1. Why is John's statement that this miracle was the \"beginning of signs\" by Christ so important? John 2:11 .\nComment: That we are told that the miracle in Cana is the first Jesus performed discredits the false traditions that He worked miracles during the thirty years before His public ministry. It invalidates the miraculous accounts in the apocryphal gospels, which have been excluded from the Bible because of their contradictions to Scripture and their counterfeit nature. All stories about Christ's alleged miracles done prior to His public ministry are false.\n2. Why does Jesus perform His first miracle at a marriage ceremony? John 2:1 .\nComment: Jesus heaps great honor on marriage by using such an event to manifest His glory. The apostle Paul writes, \"Marriage is honorable among all\" ( Hebrews 13:4 ), but society increasingly scorns marriage, a fact clearly seen in rampant premarital sex and divorce upon demand. Like Christ's coming, a wedding is a joyous celebration.\nJesus and at least six of His disciples were invited to the wedding, suggesting that the wedding couple were concerned about the character of their guests. As His blessing and presence are essential to marital happiness, Christ must be involved in our marriages. However, those who desire His involvement must invite Him in. Had Jesus not been invited to this wedding, a serious problem would have marred the marriage feast. We can learn that couples in whose marriage Christ is involved have a great advantage in solving problems that arise later.\n3. Why was running out of wine a problem? John 2:3 .\nComment: Weddings in the ancient Near East included a strong legal side, especially regarding providing the appropriate wedding gift, of which the wedding feast was a part. When the supply of wine failed at this wedding, more than social embarrassment was at stake. The bridegroom and his family could have become financially liable for inadequate wedding provisions. The seriousness of the lack of wine (symbolizing a lack of joy) helps us to appreciate the blessing contained in the miracle Jesus performed ( Ecclesiastes 9:7-9 ).\nThis situation relates to the common problems couples experience in marriage, even among God's people. We cannot always stop problems from developing, but we can overcome them with the help of Christ who dwells in us and therefore within our marriages ( Romans 8:10 ).\n4. Why does Jesus rebuke His mother for her seemingly innocent request? John 2:4 .\nComment: When Jesus reprimands Mary, calling her \"woman\" (gunai) rather than \"mother\" (meter), He implies that He is not conforming to her authority but acting under His Heavenly Father's authority. This statement establishes that Mary, even as His physical mother, has no authority over Jesus, destroying any belief that urges us to pray to Mary to intercede for us. On the two occasions in which Mary is seen intruding in His ministry\u2014here and in Matthew 12:46-50 \u2014Jesus verbally moves her aside. His rebuke censures her assumption of authority she does not have. She also seems to lack the humility with which we must go to God with our requests.\nSince the Father had already predetermined Jesus' agenda, Mary's request is inappropriate because she tries to determine what He should do. The Father would not have let Mary change His plan, so He had probably already inspired Christ to perform this miracle. Obviously, Jesus does not deny Mary a solution, but He does mildly rebuke her for her attitude toward Him and His purpose.\n5. What does Mary's response demonstrate? John 2:5 .\nComment: On behalf of the newlyweds and their families, Mary prudently goes to Jesus to solve their wine problem, emphasizing the value of friends and brethren praying for the marriages of others. The strength of Mary's faith is exhibited when she orders the servants to follow Jesus' instructions, confirming her acceptance of what He had said to her in verse 4. She demonstrates both meekness and faith by expressing a humble attitude. This is what service to Christ is all about, living in obedience to His every word.\n\u00a9 2006 Church of the Great God\nPO Box 471846\nQuestion:\nWhat was the nature of the event at which Jesus turned water into wine\nAnswer:\nCivil wedding\nPassage:\nPotemkin Stairs\nThe Potemkin Stairs, or Potemkin Steps (, Potemkinsky Skhody, ) is a giant stairway in Odessa, Ukraine. The stairs are considered a formal entrance into the city from the direction of the sea and are the best known symbol of Odessa.  The stairs were originally known as the Boulevard steps, the Giant Staircase, p. 32 or the Richelieu steps. p. 119. Referencing  p. 616 p. 18, 25 p. 498 \"The Richelieu Steps in Odessa were renamed the \"Potemkin Steps\"... p. 223 The top step is 12.5 meters (41 feet) wide, and the lowest step is 21.7 meters (70.8 feet) wide. The staircase extends for 142 meters, but it gives the illusion of greater length.  Karakina, p. 31 \"13.4 and 21.7 meters wide\"  The stairs were so precisely constructed as to create an optical illusion. A person looking down the stairs sees only the landings, and the steps are invisible, but a person looking up sees only steps, and the landings are invisible. \n\nHistory\n\nOdessa, perched on a high steppe plateau, needed direct access to the harbor below it. Before the stairs were constructed, winding paths and crude wooden stairs were the only access to the harbor.\n\nThe original 200 stairs were designed in 1825 by F. Boffo, St. Petersburg architects Avraam I. Melnikov and Pot'e.   The staircase cost 800,000 rubles to build.\n\nIn 1837 the decision was made to build a \"monstrous staircase\", which was constructed between 1837 and 1841. An English engineer named Upton supervised the construction. Upton had fled Britain while on bail for forgery. p. 61 Greenish-grey sandstone from the Austrian port of Trieste (now in Italy) was shipped in.\n\nAs erosion destroyed the stairs, in 1933 the sandstone was replaced by rose-grey granite from the Boh area, and the landings were covered with asphalt. Eight steps were lost under the sand when the port was being extended, reducing the number of stairs to 192, with ten landings.\n\nThe steps were made famous in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film The Battleship Potemkin.\n\nOn the left side of the stairs, a funicular railway was built in 1906 to transport people up and down instead of walking.  After 73 years of operation (with breaks caused by revolution and war), the funicular was replaced by an escalator in 1970. The escalator was in turn closed in 1997 but a new funicular was opened on 2 September 2005. \n\nAfter the Soviet revolution, in 1955, the Primorsky Stairs were renamed as Potemkin Stairs to honor the 50th anniversary of the mutiny on the Battleship Potemkin.Karakina, p. 31 After Ukrainian independence, like many streets in Odessa, the previous name \u2013 'Primorsky Stairs' was reinstated to the stairs. Most Odessites still know and refer to the stairs by their Soviet name.\n\nDuke de Richelieu Monument\n\nAt the top of the stairs is the Duke de Richelieu Monument, depicting Odessa's first Mayor.  The Roman-toga figure was designed by the Russian sculptor, Ivan Petrovich Martos (1754\u20131835). The statue was cast in bronze by Yefimov and unveiled in 1826. It is the first monument erected in the city.

The painting depicts the miracle of Jesus calming the storm on the Sea of Galilee, as depicted in the fourth chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament of the Christian Bible.   It is Rembrandt's only seascape.\n\nTheft\n\nOn the morning of March 18, 1990, thieves disguised as police officers broke into the museum and stole The Storm on the Sea of Galilee and 12 other works. It is considered the biggest art theft in US history and remains unsolved.  The museum still displays the paintings' empty frames in their original locations. \n\nOn March 18, 2013, the FBI announced they knew who was responsible for the crime.  Criminal analysis has suggested that the heist was committed by an organized crime group. There have been no conclusions made public as the investigation is ongoing. \n\nIn popular culture \n\nIn The Blacklist episode \"Gina Zanetakos (No. 152)\" (season 1, episode 6), Raymond Reddington has possession of The Storm on the Sea of Galilee and is arranging its sale to a buyer for the buyer's wedding. In the Complete First Season DVD, it is disc 2, Episode: Gina Zanetakos [No. 152], 5:44-46 and 40:17\n\nThe painting is referenced in the movie Trance as a stolen painting by Rembrandt.\n\nThe painting is the cover of a book called, \"Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk\" by Peter L. Bernstein.\n\nThe painting is used as the album artwork for The Struggle, the third studio album by Tenth Avenue North.\n\nThe painting makes an appearance in the video game BioShock Infinite, hanging on a wall  \n\nIn the \"Venture Brothers\" villain Phantom Limb is selling the painting to a mafioso who complains that he wanted the \"Mona Lisa\".

This painting is the only known seascape of which great artist?\nAnswer:\nRembrandt\nPassage:\nBledisloe Cup\nThe Bledisloe Cup is a rugby union competition between the national teams of Australia and New Zealand that has been competed for since the 1930s. The frequency at which the competition has been held and the number of matches played has varied, but , it consists of an annual three-match series, with two of the matches also counting towards The Rugby Championship. New Zealand have had the most success, winning the trophy for the 43rd time in 2015, while Australia have won 12 times.\n\nHistory\n\nThere is some dispute as to when the first Bledisloe Cup match was played. The Australian Rugby Union (ARU) contend that the one-off 1931 match played at Eden Park was first. However, no firm evidence has been produced to support this claim, and minutes from a New Zealand union management meeting several days later record Lord Bledisloe wishing to present a cup for the All Blacks and Wallabies to play for. The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) believe that the first match was when New Zealand toured Australia in 1932.\n\nBetween 1931 and 1981 it was contested irregularly in the course of rugby tours between the two countries. New Zealand won it 19 times and Australia four times in this period including in 1949 when Australia won it for the first time on New Zealand soil. The trophy itself was apparently 'lost' during this period and reportedly rediscovered in a Melbourne store room. In the years 1982 to 1995 it was contested annually, sometimes as a series of three matches (two in 1995) and other times in a single match. During these years New Zealand won it 11 times and Australia three times.\n\nSince 1996 the cup has been contested as part of the annual Tri Nations tournament. Until 1998 the cup was contested in a three match series: the two Tri Nations matches between these sides and a third match. New Zealand won these series in 1996 and 1997, and Australia won it in 1998.\n\nIn 1996 and from 1999 through 2005, the third match was not played; during those years, Australia and New Zealand played each other twice as part of the Tri Nations for the cup. If both teams won one of these games, or if both games were drawn, the cup was retained by its current holder. The non-holder had to win the two games 2\u20130 or 1\u20130 (with a draw) to regain the Cup. A criticism of this system was that with the closeness in the level of ability between the two sides, years where each team won one game each were very common (1999, 2000, 2002, 2004) and in these years, many rugby fans felt dissatisfied with one team keeping the cup in a series tied at 1\u20131.\n\n2006 saw the return of the 3-game contest for the Bledisloe Cup as the Tri Nations series was extended so that each team played each other 3 times. The 2007 Cup, however, reverted to the two-game contest because the Tri Nations was abbreviated that year to minimise interference with the teams' preparations for the World Cup.\n\nIn 2008 it was announced that the Bledisloe Cup would be contested over an unprecedented four matches, with three games played in Australia and New Zealand and a fourth and potentially deciding game in Hong Kong in an effort to promote the game in Asia (the first time Australia and New Zealand played in a third country outside the World Cup).  The Hong Kong match, which drew a crowd of 39,000 to see the All Blacks (which had already clinched the Bledisloe Cup) defeat the Wallabies 19\u201314,  proved to be a financial success for the two unions, generating a reported \u00a35.5\u00a0million.  Even before the match, the two countries' rugby federations were considering taking Cup matches to the United States and Japan in 2009 and 2010. Japan hosted a fourth Bledisloe Test match on 31 October 2009. Each team is expected to clear at least A$3.8\u00a0million/NZ$5\u00a0million from the Tokyo match.  However a 2010 fourth match was set in Hong Kong and has struggled to attract crowds. \n\nThe three-match format for the Bledisloe Cup continued in 2012, with the first two matches taking place as part of the 2012 Rugby Championship.\n\nResults\n\nOverall\n\nMost titles won:\n# New Zealand \u2013 43 \n# Australia \u2013 12\n\nLongest time held by Australia: 5 years (1998\u20132002) (5 Titles)\n\nLongest time held by New Zealand: 28\nyears (1951\u20131978) (12 Titles)\n\nMost titles in a row by New Zealand: (2003\u20132015) (13 Titles)\n\nBy Year \n\nMedia coverage\n\nIn Australia, the Bledisloe Cup was televised between 1992 to 1995 by Network Ten. Since 1996, Fox Sports has televised it. They jointly televised it with Seven Network between 1996 to 2010, Nine Network in 2011 and 2012 and Network Ten since 2013.\nQuestion:\nWhat sport is the Bledisloe Cup awarded annually?\nAnswer:\nRugby union footballer\nPassage:\nWhat do you call a female seal? | Reference.com\nWhat do you call a female seal? | Reference.com\nWhat do you call a female seal?\nA:\nQuick Answer\nA female seal is called a cow, her mate is a bull and her babies are pups; during breeding season, the three are part of a harem. There are numerous species of seals, including elephant, fur and leopard varieties.\nFull Answer\nFemale seals deliver one pup each year. The pup nurses from four days to one month, during which time the female does not eat. She uses stored blubber for energy. After weaning, a pup learns to swim and hunt entirely on its own with instinct as his guide. Seals are warm-blooded marine mammals that live in ocean waters at all latitudes.\nQuestion:\nA group of female seals is called what?\nAnswer:\nHougong\nPassage:\nMaria Dickin\nMaria Elisabeth Dickin CBE (nickname, Mia; 22 September 1870 \u2013 1 March 1951) was a social reformer  and an animal welfare pioneer who founded the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) in 1917. Born in 1870 in London, she was the oldest of eight children; her parents were William George Dickin, a Wesleyan minister, and Ellen Maria (n\u00e9e Exell). She married her first cousin, Arnold Francis Dickin, an accountant, in 1899; they had no children. She enjoyed music, literary work and philanthropy.

The Dartmouth,         the Elanor and the Beaver were guarded by just over twenty revolutionary         guards to prevent them from being unloaded. Yet Massachusetts Governor,         Thomas Hutchinson, the grandson of Anne Hutchinson would not permit the         ships to depart without unloading.\nLord         Frederick North, England's Prime Minister never expected this tea tax         to cause an outcry, let alone revolution. In 1767 England reduced its         property taxes at home. To balance the national budget they needed to         find a mechanism for the American colonies to pay for the expense of stationing         officials in them. Under the Townshed Act the officials would generate         their own revenue by collecting taxes on all imported goods, and once         paid affixing stamps on them. This Stamp Tax generated more in the way         of protests and smuggling than added revenue.\nWhy tea?\nRecognizing this failure, Lord North repealed the stamp tax in 1773, except         for a reduced tax which remained on tea. This was both out of principal         to maintain the English ability to tax, and to support a national company,         the East India Tea Company, which had suffered revenue loss as nearly         90% of America's tea had been smuggled from foreign lands. This tea would         be the only legally imported tea in the colonies, and old at a discount         below customary prices to curtail smuggling.\nAmerican merchants recognized this monopoly took money from their pockets,         and resisted this tea monopoly. Merchants added to the revolutionary fervor.         Locally the agents of the East India company were pressured to resign         their posts, and ships were sent away unloaded from American coasts.\nFor         a decade Sam Adams had been inspiring revolution, this was his hour. Adams         is widely believed to have orchestrated the Boston Tea Party. A town meeting         was called for the evening of December 16th at Faneuil         Hall . All British eyes were on the meeting, which when it overfilled         Faneuil moved to the larger Old         South Church .\nThere was little notice of a committee which met with Governor Hutchinson         during the meeting, or the messenger who returned with news that no settlement         could be reached. But at that exact moment colonials disguised as Mohawk         Indians boarded the three ships.\nAs John Adams later noted, these were no ordinary Mohawks. They had already         organized themselves into boarding parties who easily took over the merchant         ships and demanded access to the cargo. Discipline prevented the participants         from vandalizing the ships, or stealing tea for personal consumption.         They destroyed 14,000 British pounds of tea, which equates to over one         million dollars in today's currency.\nLord North's reaction was fierce. 3,000 British soldiers were sent to         Boston, which equalled one fifth of the town's population. Boston's port         was closed except for military ships, self governance was suspended. In         order to house these troops, rights were given to soldiers to quarter         themselves in any unoccupied colonial building. The Old South Church,         the point were the teaparty was launched was gutted by the British and         converted to a riding arena and pub for troops.\nBy January of 1775 it was clear to Lord North that revolution was at hand.         He sent a peace making delegation offering to end all taxes provided the         colonies promised to pay the salaries of civil authorities regularly.         But it was too late. Events now overtook the hope of a peaceful reconciliation.         That spring, on April 16th the American Crisis turned into the American         Revolution, and Lord North tendered his resignation.\nKing George refused North's resignation, as he would for the duration         of the American Revolutionary war. Lord North would ultimately be known         as the Prime Minister who lost England's American colonies.\nINTRODUCING\nQuestion:\nWho was British Prime Minister at the time of 'The Boston Tea Party'?\nAnswer:\nLORD(Frederick)NORTH\n\n\nPassage:\nOlivier, Laurence Kerr, Baron Olivier of Brighton\nOlivier, Laurence Kerr, Baron Olivier of Brighton\nEncyclopedia \u00a0>\u00a0 People \u00a0>\u00a0 Literature and the Arts \u00a0>\u00a0 Theater: Biographies\nLaurence Kerr Olivier,  Baron Olivier of Brighton\nOlivier, Laurence Kerr, Baron Olivier of Brighton (\u014dl\u012dv\u02c8\u0113-\u0101\u02cc)\u00a0[ key ], 1907\u201389, English actor, director, and producer.

He worked for Joint Promotions and the British Wrestling Federation. Initially a villain, he teamed with Giant Haystacks. He later became a fan favourite, working until the 1990s.\n\nProfessional wrestling career \n\nEarly career\n\nCrabtree decided to follow in the footsteps of his father, Shirley Crabtree, Sr., becoming a professional wrestler in 1952. He first became popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a blue-eye billed as \"Blond Adonis Shirley Crabtree.\" He won the European Heavyweight Championship in Joint Promotions and a disputed branch of the British Heavyweight title in the independent British Wrestling Federation before he quit in 1966 following a (non-kayfabe) campaign of harassment by former champion Bert Assirati. He retired for roughly six years.\n\nComeback\n\nIn 1972, Crabtree returned to Joint Promotions as a villain with a gimmick of The Battling Guardsman based on his former service with the Coldstream. It was during this period that he made his first appearances on World of Sport on ITV.\n\nNot long afterwards, Shirley's brother, Max, was appointed as Northern area booker with Joint Promotions and began to transform Crabtree into the persona for which he would be best remembered. Based originally on the character of the same name played by actor Burl Ives in the first screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), 'Big Daddy' was first given life by Crabtree in late 1974, initially still as a villain. The character's leotards were emblazoned with just a large \"D\" and were fashioned by his wife Eunice from their chintz sofa. The character first gained attention in mid-1975 when he formed a tag team with TV newcomer Giant Haystacks. However, during this period, Daddy began to be cheered for the first time since his comeback when he entered into a feud with masked villain Kendo Nagasaki, especially when he unmasked Nagasaki during a televised contest from Solihull in December 1975 (although the unmasked Nagasaki quickly won the bout moments later).\n\nBy the middle of 1977, Daddy had completed his transformation into a blue eye, a change cemented by the breakdown of his tag team with Haystacks and a subsequent feud between the two which would last until the early 1990s. A firm fans' favourite particularly amongst children, Big Daddy came to the ring in either a sequinned cape or a Union Flag jacket and top hat. In addition to his feud with Haystacks, Daddy also feuded with Canadian wrestler 'Mighty' John Quinn. He headlined Wembley Arena with singles matches against Quinn in 1979 and Haystacks in 1981. Later in the 1980s he feuded with Dave \"Fit\" Finlay, Drew McDonald and numerous other villains.\n\nIn August 1987 at the Hippodrome circus in Great Yarmouth, Big Daddy performed in a tag team match pitting himself and nephew Steve Crabtree (billed as \"Greg Valentine\") against King Kong Kirk and King Kendo. After Big Daddy had delivered a splash and pinned King Kong Kirk, rather than selling the impact of the finishing move, Kirk turned an unhealthy colour and was rushed to a nearby hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival. Despite the fact that the inquest into Kirk's death found that he had a serious heart condition and cleared Crabtree of any responsibility, Crabtree was devastated.\n\nHe continued to make regular appearances into the early 1990s, but he eventually retired from wrestling altogether to spend the remainder of his days in his home town of Halifax. During his career, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth II said they were fans of 'Big Daddy'.  \n\nPersonal life \n\nCrabtree was a former rugby league player for league club Bradford Northern. His temper often forced him off the pitch early.  He also had stints as a coal miner and with the British Army's Coldstream Guards.\n\nCrabtree's 64\u00a0inch chest earned him a place in the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nHis brother Brian was a wrestling referee and later MC, while his other brother Max was a booker for \u2013 and later proprietor of \u2013 Joint Promotions. His nephews Steve and Scott Crabtree also had wrestling careers \u2013 Steve wrestled in the 1980s and 1990s, billed as 'Greg Valentine' (named after the American wrestler of the same name) while Scott wrestled as Scott Valentine. Both worked as tag team partners for their uncle. Another nephew Eorl Crabtree is now a Huddersfield and England international rugby league player.\n\nCrabtree died of a stroke in December 1997 in Halifax General Hospital. He was survived by his second wife of 31 years, Eunice and six children. \n\nOther media\n\nBig Daddy had his own comic strip in Buster during the early 1980s drawn by Mike Lacey. In 1982 ITV planned to build a TV programme around 'Big Daddy' as a replacement for the popular children's Saturday morning Tiswas show. A pilot for Big Daddy's Saturday Show was shot and a series announced but Crabtree pulled out at the last moment, leaving the hastily renamed The Saturday Show presented by Isla St Clair and Tommy Boyd.\n\nThe European version of the multi-format game Legends of Wrestling II featured Big Daddy as an exclusive extra Legendary Wrestler.\n\nA stage play by Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon, Big Daddy vs Giant Haystacks premiered at the Brighton Festival Fringe in East Sussex, England between 26\u201328 May 2011 and subsequently toured Great Britain.  Big Daddy features on Luke Haines' 2011 album \"9\u00bd Psychedelic Meditations on British Wrestling of the 1970s and early '80s\" as the owner of a Casio VL-Tone synthesizer.\n\nIn wrestling\n\n*Finishing moves\n*Daddy Splash (Big splash)\n\n*Signature moves\n*Body block\n*Scoop slam\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n\n*British Wrestling Federation\n*British Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\n*European Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nEnglish wrestler Shirley Crabtree Jr was better known by what name?\nAnswer:\nBig Daddy\nPassage:\nMovie Review - - The Screen:'W .C.

Fields in \"Poppy,\" Graham Greene wrote \"To watch Mr. Fields, as Dickensian as anything Dickens ever wrote, is a form of escape for poor human creatures . . . who are haunted by pity, by fear, by our sense of right and wrong . . . by conscience. . .\" This prize of escape is the major thing missing from the dreadful new film \"W. C. Fields and Me.\" It holds up a wax dummy of a character intended to represent the great misanthropic comedian and expects us to feel compassion but only traps us in embarrassment.\n\"W. C. Fields and Me,\" which opened yesterday at three theaters, is based on the memoir written by Carlotta Monti, Fields's mistress for the last 14 years of his life. The book, written with Cy Rice, is gushy, foolish and self-serving, which is probably understandable.\nTo expect it to be anything else, I suppose, would be to look for the definitive analysis of the Cuban missile crisis in a memoir by a White House cook. Yet the movie needn't have been quite as brainless as it is. That took work.\nFirst off, Bob Merrill, who has written either the lyrics or music (sometimes both) for some good Broadway shows, including \"New Girl in Town,\" has supplied a screenplay that originally may have been meant as the outline for a musical. It exhibits a tell-tale disregard for facts and the compulsion to make a dramatically shapeless life fit into a two-act form. The mind that attends to this sort of hack business would cast Raquel Welsh in the title role of \"The Life and Loves of Bliss Carman.\"\nThen there's Arthur Hiller, a director who makes intelligent films when the material is right (\"Hospital,\" \"The Americanization of Emily\") and terrible ones when the writers fail.\nMost prominent in the mess is Rod Steiger, who has been got up in a false nose and dyed hair in a way meant to make him look like Fields, which he does (sort of though he reminds me much more of the way Fields's one-time co-star, Mae West, looked in \"Myra Breckinridge.\" The exterior is pure plastic, though occasionally one sees a sign of individual life deep inside the two holes that have been cut out for the eyes.\nThe film opens in the 1920's in New York, when Fields was already a big Ziegfeld star, and closes with his death in California in 1946, at the age of 67, when he had become one of Hollywood's most celebrated stars. In between these dates \"W.C. Fields and Me\" attempts to dramatize\u2014with no conviction\u2014the complex, witty actor-writer as if he were one of his own ill-tempered, suspicious heroes with a suddenly discovered heart of gold.\nMr. Steiger reads all of his lines with the monotonous sing-song manner used by third-rate nightclub comics doing Fields imitations. He also speaks most of them out of the corner of his mouth as if he'd had a stroke.\nValerie Perrine, a spectacularly beautiful woman who may also be a good actress, plays Miss Monti, who, in this film anyway, is an unconvincing combination of intelligence, patience, fidelity, sportsmanship and masochism. Perhaps because the visual style of the entire film is more or less mortuous, Jack Cassidy, who plays a flyweight John Barrymore, wears the kind of makeup that makes him look dead several reels before he actually dies.\nThe movie contains two halfway funny moments: a scene in which we see Fields taking a broom to a swan that has trespassed his Hollywood lawn, and the sight of Baby Harold (based on Baby Leroy, one of Fields's toughest costars) staggering out of his set-side dressing room after Fields has spiked the kid's orange juice with gin.\nW.C. FIELDS AND ME, directed by Arthur Hiller; screenplay by Bob Merrill, based on the book by Carlotta Monti with Cy Rice; produced by Jay Weston; director of photography, David M. Walsh; editor, John C. Howard; music, Henry Mancini; distributed by Universal Pictures. Running time: 110 minutes. At the Criterion Theater, Broadway at 45th Street, Baronet Theater, 34th Street near Second Avenue. This film has been rated PG.\nW.C. Fields . . . . .

She joined the SOE in revenge for her godmother's father having been shot by the Nazis,  officially joining on 1 November 1943 and was commissioned as an Honorary Section Officer.\n\nShe parachuted into Orne, Normandy on 1 May 1944 to operate as part of the Scientist circuit, using the codename Genevieve to work as a wireless operator with the organiser Claude de Baissac and his sister Lis\u00e9 de Baissac (the courier).  She worked successfully and largely avoiding detection of the Germans, she sent over 135 messages to London, remaining in France until the liberation in August 1944.\n\nPost World War II\n\nAfter World War II, Latour married an engineer with the surname Doyle, and went to live in Kenya (East Africa),  Fiji, and Australia. She now lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nHonours and awards\n\nLatour was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour (Knight of the Legion of Honour), by the French government on 29 November 2014, as part of the 70th anniversary of the battle of Normandy.  \n\nNotes\nQuestion:\n\"In 2014 at the age of 93 Phyllis Latour Doyle, \"\"Pippa\"\", received the Chevalier de l'Ordre National de la Legion d'Honneur, (the Legion of Honour, knight class) for activities in occupied France in World War II; where was she born, and where did she grow up?\"\nAnswer:\nSouth africa\nPassage:\nL\u00e6rdal Tunnel\nL\u00e6rdal Tunnel () is a  long road tunnel connecting L\u00e6rdal and Aurland in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway and located approximately 175 \u2013 north-east of Bergen. It is the longest road tunnel in the world succeeding the Swiss Gotthard Road Tunnel. The tunnel carries two lanes of European Route E16 and represents the final link on the new main highway connecting Oslo and Bergen without ferry connections and difficult mountain crossings during winter.\n\nIn 1975, the Parliament of Norway decided that the main road between Oslo and Bergen would run via Filefjell. In 1992, Parliament confirmed that decision, made the further decision that the road should run through a tunnel between L\u00e6rdal and Aurland, and passed legislation to build the tunnel. Construction started in 1995 and the tunnel opened in 2000. It cost 1.082 billion Norwegian krone ($113.1M USD). \n\nDesign\n\nA total of 2500000 m3 of rock was removed from the tunnel during its construction from 1995 to 2000.  The tunnel begins just east of Aurlandsvangen in Aurland and goes through a mountain range and ends  south of L\u00e6rdals\u00f8yri in L\u00e6rdal.  The design of the tunnel takes into consideration the mental strain on drivers, so the tunnel is divided into four sections, separated by three large mountain caves at 6 km intervals.  While the main tunnel has white lights, the caves have blue lighting with yellow lights at the fringes to give an impression of sunrise.   The caves are meant to break the routine, providing a refreshing view and allowing drivers to take a short rest.  The caverns are also used as turn around points and for break areas to help lift claustrophobia during a 20-minute drive through the tunnel.  To keep drivers from being inattentive or falling asleep, each lane is supplied with a loud rumble strip towards the centre.\n\nSafety\n\nThe tunnel does not have emergency exits. In case of accidents and/or fire, many safety precautions have been made.  There are emergency phones marked \"SOS\" every 250 m which can contact the police, fire departments, and hospitals.  Fire extinguishers have been placed every 125 m.  Whenever an emergency phone in the tunnel is used or a fire extinguisher is lifted, stop lights and electronic signs reading: snu og k\u00f8yr ut () are displayed throughout the tunnel and 2 other electronic signs on both sides of the entrance reading: tunnelen stengt  (English: Tunnel closed).  There are 15 turning areas which were constructed for buses and semi-trailers.  In addition to the three large caverns, emergency niches have been built every 500 m.  There are photo inspections and counting of all vehicles that enter and exit the tunnel at security centres in L\u00e6rdal and Bergen.  There is also special wiring in the tunnel for the use of radio and mobile phones.  Speed cameras have been installed  because of serious speeding (there are very few other completely straight roads in the region).\n\nAir quality\n\nHigh air quality in the tunnel is achieved in two ways: ventilation and purification. Large fans draw air in from both entrances, and polluted air is expelled through the ventilation tunnel to Tynjadalen. The L\u00e6rdal Tunnel is the first in the world to be equipped with an air treatment plant, located in a 100 m wide cavern about  northwest of Aurlandsvangen.  The plant removes both dust and nitrogen dioxide from the tunnel air. Two large fans draw air through the treatment plant, where dust and soot are removed by an electrostatic filter. Then the air is drawn through a large carbon filter which removes the nitrogen dioxide.\nQuestion:\nIn which country is the Laerdal Tunnel, the longest road tunnel in the world?\nAnswer:\nNorv\u00e8ge\nPassage:\nAlis volat propriis\nAlis volat propriis is a Latin phrase used as the motto of U.S. state of Oregon. \n\nThe official English version of the motto is \"She flies with her own wings\" in keeping with the tradition of considering countries and territories to be feminine.  However, because the feminine pronoun in the Latin sentences is often omitted and the verb form is not inflected for gender, the phrase could be translated with equal validity as \"[one] flies with [one's] own wings\" or \"[it] flies with [its] own wings\". \n\nIf macrons are used to indicate the long vowels (standard practice in Latin dictionaries and textbooks), then the phrase becomes \u0100l\u012bs volat propri\u012bs.\n\nThe motto was written in English by judge Jesse Quinn Thornton, and its Latin translation was added to the Territorial Seal adopted by the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1854.  The motto referred to the May 2, 1843 vote by Oregon Country settlers at the third Champoeg Meeting to form a provisional government independent of the United States and Great Britain. During the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865 the motto on the state seal was changed to \"The Union.\"Lansing, Ronald B. 2005. Nimrod: Courts, Claims, and Killing on the Oregon Frontier. Pullman: Washington State University Press. p. 90, 136-40, 262. In 1957, the Oregon Legislature officially changed the motto to \"The Union\" reflecting conflicting views about slavery in Oregon's early days.\n\nIn 1987, the legislature readopted the original motto, which it felt better reflected Oregon's independent spirit. The sponsors of the bill that changed the motto back to alis volat propriis included the Oregon Secretary of State and later Governor Barbara Roberts, President of the Oregon Senate Jason Boe, and Senate historian Cecil Edwards.\n\nIn 1999, after a short debate in committee, the Oregon House of Representatives took a vote on HB 2269, which would revert the state motto to \"The Union\". The bill failed to pass on a 30-30 tie vote. \n\nThe current Oregon State Seal, which appears on the obverse of the state flag, still features the motto \"The Union.\"\nQuestion:\nFeb 14, 1859 saw what state, with an offical motto that translates as \"She Flies With Her Own Wings\", join the union as the 33rd?\nAnswer:\nDemographics of Oregon\nPassage:\nMattock\nA mattock is a versatile hand tool, used for digging and chopping, similar to the pickaxe. It has a long handle, and a stout head, which combines an axe blade and an adze (cutter mattock) or a pick and an adze (pick mattock).\n\nDescription\n\nA mattock has a shaft, typically made of wood, which is about 3 - long.  The head comprises two ends, opposite each other, and separated by a central eye; a mattock head typically weighs 3 -. The form of the head determines its identity and its use:\n\n*The head of a pick mattock combines a pick and an adze. It is \"one of the best tools for grubbing in hard soils and rocky terrain\".  The adze may be sharpened, but the pick rarely is; it is generally squared rather than beveled.\n*The head of a cutter mattock combines an axe with an adze. Thus, it has two flat blades, facing away from each other, and one rotated 90\u00b0 relative to the other. The blade is designed to be used for cutting through roots.\n\nThe handle of a mattock fits into the oval eye in the head, and is fixed by striking the head end of the handle against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, a rock or firm ground. The head end of the handle is tapered outwards, and the oval opening in the iron tool is similarly tapered so that the head will never fly off when in use.  The mattock blade ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, so that it will not slide  down and hit the user's hands.  The mattock is meant for swinging between one's legs, as in digging a ditch with one foot on either side.  Tapping the handle end on the ground while holding the head  allows the handle to be removed. In the eastern United States, mattock handles are often fitted with a screw below the head and parallel with it, to prevent the head slipping down the handle; in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done.\n\nUses\n\nMattocks are \"the most versatile of hand-planting tools\". They can be used to chop into the ground with the adze and pull the soil towards the user, opening a slit to plant into.  They can also be used to dig holes for planting into, and are particularly useful where there is a thick layer of matted sod. The use of a mattock can be tiring because of the effort needed to drive the blade into the ground, and the amount of bending and stooping involved.\n\nThe adze of a mattock is useful for digging or hoeing, especially in hard soil.\n\nCutter mattocks () are used in rural Africa for removing stumps from fields, including unwanted banana suckers. \n\nThe mattock was most likely the main murder weapon when six people were killed in the brutal murders in Hinterkaifeck.\n\nHistory\n\nAs a simple but effective tool, mattocks have a long history. Their shape was already established by the Bronze Age in Asia Minor and Ancient Greece.,  and mattocks () were the most commonly depicted tool in Byzantine manuscripts of Hesiod's Works and Days. \n\nMattocks made from antlers first appear in the British Isles in the Late Mesolithic. They were probably used chiefly for digging, and may have been related to the rise of agriculture.  Mattocks made of whalebone were used for tasks including flensing \u2013 stripping blubber from the carcass of a whale \u2013 by the broch people of Scotland and by the Inuit. \n\nEtymology\n\nThe word mattock is of unclear origin; one theory traces it from Proto-Germanic, from Proto-Indo-European (see Wiktionary). There are no clear cognates in other Germanic languages, and similar words in various Celtic languages are borrowings from the English (e.g. , , ).  However, there are proposed cognates in Old High German and Middle High German, and more speculatively with words in Balto-Slavic languages, including Old Church Slavonic ' and Lithuanian ', and even Sanskrit. It may be cognate to or derived from the unattested Vulgar Latin ', meaning club or cudgel. The New English Dictionary of 1906 interpreted mattock as a diminutive, but there is no root to derive it from, and no semantic reason for the diminutive formation. Forms such as mathooke, motthook and mathook were produced by folk etymology. Although used to prepare whale blubber, which the Inuit call \"mattaq\", no such connection is known. \n\nWhile the noun \"mattock\" is attested from Old English onwards, the transitive verb \"to mattock\" or \"to mattock up\" first appeared in the mid-17th century.\nQuestion:\nA mattock (alternatively called a dibber in some countries) is used mainly for?\nAnswer:\nDig\nPassage:\nWashboard (musical instrument)\nThe washboard and frottoir (from Cajun French \"frotter\", to rub) are used as a percussion instrument, employing the ribbed metal surface of the cleaning device as a rhythm instrument. As traditionally used in jazz, zydeco, skiffle, jug band, and old-time music, the washboard remained in its wooden frame and is played primarily by tapping, but also scraping the washboard with thimbles. Often the washboard has additional traps, such as a wood block, a cowbell, and even small cymbals. Conversely, the frottoir (zydeco rubboard) dispenses with the frame and consists simply of the metal ribbing hung around the neck. It is played primarily with spoon handles or bottle openers in a combination of strumming, scratching, tapping and rolling.  The frottoir or vest frottoir is played as a stroked percussion instrument, often in a band with a drummer, while the washboard generally is a replacement for drums. In Zydeco bands, the frottoir is usually played with bottle openers, to make a louder sound. It tends to play counter-rhythms to the drummer. In a jug band, the washboard can also be stroked with a single whisk broom and functions as the drums for the band, playing only on the back-beat for most songs, a substitute for a snare drum. In a four-beat measure, the washboard will stroke on the 2-beat and the 4-beat. Its best sound is achieved using a single steel-wire snare-brush or whisk broom.  However, in a jazz setting, the washboard can also be played with thimbles on all fingers, tapping out much more complex rhythms, as in The Washboard Rhythm Kings, a full-sized band, and Newman Taylor Baker.\n\nThere are three general ways of deploying the washboard for use as an instrument. The first, mainly used by American players like Washboard Chaz of the Washboard Chaz Blues Trio and Ralf Reynolds of the Reynolds Brothers Rhythm Rascals, is to drape it vertically down the chest. The second, used by European players like David Langlois of the Blue Vipers of Brooklyn and Stephane Seva of Paris Washboard, is to hold it horizontally across the lap, or, for more complex setups, to mount it horizontally on a purpose-built stand. The third (and least common) method, used by Washboard Sam and Deryck Guyler, is to hold it in a perpendicular orientation between the legs while seated, so that both sides of the board might be played at the same time.\n\nThere is a Polish traditional jazz festival and music award named \"Z\u0142ota Tarka\" (Golden Washboard).  Washboards, called \"zatulas\", are also occasionally used in Ukrainian folk music.\n\nHistory\n\nThe washboard as a percussion instrument ultimately derives from the practice of hamboning as practiced in West Africa and brought to the new world by African slaves.   This led to the development of Jug bands which used jugs, spoons, and washboards to provide the rhythm.   Jug bands became popular in the 1920s.\n\nThe frottoir, also called a Zydeco rub-board, is a mid-20th century invention designed specifically for Zydeco music.  It is one of the few musical instruments invented entirely in the United States and represents a distillation of the washboard into essential elements (percussive surface with shoulder straps).  It was designed in 1946 by Clifton Chenier and fashioned by Willie Landry, a friend and metalworker at the Texaco refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. Clifton's brother Cleveland Chenier famously played this newly designed rubboard using bottle openers. Likewise, Willie's son, Tee Don Landry, continues the traditional hand manufacturing of rubboards in his small shop in Sunset, Louisiana, between Lafayette and Opelousas. \n\nIn 2010 Saint Blues Guitar Workshop launched an electric washboard percussion instrument called the Woogie Board. \n\nWell known washboard musicians\n\nIn British Columbia, Canada, Tony McBride, known as \"Mad Fingers McBride\", performs with a group called The Genuine Jug Band. Tony is referred to as \"The Canadian Washboard King\". His percussion set-up was created by Douglas Fraser, of the same band. The washboard set-up was seen in Modern Drummer magazine, August 2014 edition.\n\nMusician Steve Katz famously played washboard with the Even Dozen Jug Band.  His playing can be heard on the group\u2019s legendary self-titled Elektra recording from 1964. Katz reprised his washboard playing on Played a Little Fiddle, a 2007 recording featuring Steve Katz, Stefan Grossman and Danny Kalb. Katz's washboard approach is notable as he plays the instrument horizontally. Additionally, Katz uses fingerpicks instead of thimbles.\n\nDuring their early years, Mungo Jerry frequently featured washboard on stage and on record, played by Joe Rush.\n\nJim \"Dandy\" Mangrum, lead singer of Southern rock band Black Oak Arkansas, is well known for incorporating the washboard into many of the band's songs, notably \"When Electricity Came to Arkansas.\"  Self taught Elizabeth Bougerol has made the washboard a key element of The Hot Sardines jazz band.\n\nCody Dickinson, a member of hill country blues bands the North Mississippi Allstars and Country Hill Revue plays an electrified washboard on a self-written track, \"Psychedelic Sex Machine\". The song is almost entirely centered around the sound of the washboard, captured by a small clip-on microphone. The sound is then sent through a wah-wah and other effects pedals to create a fresher, more innovative and up-to-date sound for the washboard. A frottoir is played with a stroking instrument (usually with spoon handles or a pair of bottle-openers) in each hand. In a 4-beat measure, the frottoir will be stroked 8 to 16 times. It plays more like a Latin percussion instrument, rather than as a drum. The rhythms used are often similar to those played on Guiro.\n\nActor Deryck Guyler was well known for his washboard-playing skills.\nQuestion:\nA washboard scraped with a thimble features as an instrument in what kind of music?\nAnswer:\nSkiffle band\nPassage:\nCell division\nCell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.  Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis),  and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half, to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions: homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the second division.  Both of these cell division cycles are used in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle, and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.  Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission, where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication.\n\nFor simple unicellular organismsSingle cell organisms. See discussion within lead of the article on microorganism. such as the amoeba, one cell division is equivalent to reproduction \u2013 an entire new organism is created. On a larger scale, mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms, such as plants that grow from cuttings. Cell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from the one-celled zygote, which itself was produced by cell division from gametes. And after growth, cell division allows for continual construction and repair of the organism.  A human being's body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime. \n\nThe primary concern of cell division is the maintenance of the original cell's genome. Before division can occur, the genomic information that is stored in chromosomes must be replicated, and the duplicated genome must be separated cleanly between cells. A great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved in keeping genomic information consistent between \"generations\".\n\nVariants\n\nCells are classified into two main categories: simple, non-nucleated prokaryotic cells, and complex, nucleated eukaryotic cells. Owing to their structural differences, eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells do not divide in the same way. Also, the pattern of cell division that transforms eukaryotic stem cells into gametes (sperm cells in males or ova \u2013 egg cells \u2013 in females) is different from that of the somatic cell division in the cells of the body.\n\nDegradation\n\nMulticellular organisms replace worn-out cells through cell division. In some animals, however, cell division eventually halts. In humans this occurs on average, after 52 divisions, known as the Hayflick limit. The cell is then referred to as senescent. Cells stop dividing because the telomeres, protective bits of DNA on the end of a chromosome required for replication, shorten with each copy, eventually being consumed. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are not thought to degrade in this way, if at all. An enzyme called telomerase, present in large quantities in cancerous cells, rebuilds the telomeres, allowing division to continue indefinitely.\nQuestion:\nWhat divides in two in a process called mitosis?\nAnswer:\nCellular processes\nPassage:\nPelisse\nA pelisse was originally a short fur lined or fur trimmed jacket that was usually worn hanging loose over the left shoulder of hussar light cavalry soldiers, ostensibly to prevent sword cuts. The name was also applied to a fashionable style of woman's coat worn in the early 19th century.\n\nMilitary uniform\n\nThe style of uniform incorporating the pelisse originated with the Hussar mercenaries of Hungary in the 17th Century. As this type of light cavalry unit became popular in Western Europe, so too did their dress. In the 19th century pelisses were in use throughout most armies in Europe, and even some in North and South America.\n\nIn appearance the pelisse was characteristically a very short and extremely tight fitting (when worn) jacket, the cuffs and collar of which were trimmed with fur. The jacket was further decorated with patterns sewn in bullion lace. The front of the jacket was distinctive and featured several rows of parallel frogging and loops, and either three or five lines of buttons. For officers of the British Hussars this frogging, regimentally differentiated, was generally of gold or silver bullion lace, to match either gold (gilt) or silver buttons. Other ranks had either yellow lace with brass buttons or white lace with 'white-metal' buttons. Lacing varied from unit to unit and country to country. The pelisse was usually worn slung over the left shoulder, in the manner of a short cloak, over a jacket of similar style - but without the fur lining or trim - called a dolman jacket. It was held in place by a lanyard. In cold weather the pelisse could be worn over the dolman.\n \nThe prevalence of this style began to wane towards the end of the 19th Century, but it was still in use by some cavalry regiments in the Imperial German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies up until World War I. The two hussar regiments of the Spanish Army retained pelisses until 1931. The Danish Garderhusarregimentet are  the only modern military unit to retain this distinctive item of dress, as part of their mounted full-dress uniform. \n\nLadies fashion\n\nIn early 19th-century Europe, when military clothing was often used as inspiration for fashionable ladies' garments, the term was applied to a woman's long, fitted coat with set-in sleeves and the then-fashionable Empire waist. Although initially these Regency-era pelisses copied the Hussars' fur and braid, they soon lost these initial associations, and in fact were often made entirely of silk and without fur at all. They did, however, tend to retain traces of their military inspiration with frog fastenings and braid trim.\nPelisses lost even this superficial resemblance to their origins as skirts and sleeves widened in the 1830s, and the increasingly enormous crinolines of the 1840s and '50s caused fashionable women to turn to loose mantles, cloaks, and shawls instead.\nQuestion:\nA pelisse is what type of garment?\nAnswer:\nKinikini\nPassage:\nCape Matapan\nCape Matapan (, or \u039c\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac in the Maniot dialect), also named as Cape Tainaron (), or Cape Tenaro, is situated at the end of the Mani Peninsula, Greece. Cape Matapan is the southernmost point of mainland Greece, and the second southernmost point in mainland Europe. It separates the Messenian Gulf in the west from the Laconian Gulf in the east.\n\nHistory\n\nCape Matapan has been an important place for thousands of years. The tip of Cape Matapan was the site of the ancient town Tenarus, near which there was (and still is) a cave that Greek legends claim was the home of Hades, the god of the dead. The ancient Spartans built several temples there, dedicated to various gods.  On the hill situated above the cave, lie the remnants of an ancient temple dedicated to the sea god Poseidon (\u039d\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2).  Under the Byzantine Empire, the temple was converted into a Christian church, and Christian rites are conducted there to this day. Cape Matapan was once the place where mercenaries waited to be employed.\n\nAt Cape Matapan, the Titanic's would-be rescue ship, the SS Californian, was torpedoed and sunk by German forces on 9\u00a0November 1915. In March 1941, a major naval battle, the Battle of Cape Matapan, occurred off the coast of Cape Matapan, between the Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina, in which the British emerged victorious in a one-sided encounter. The encounter's main result was to drastically reduce future Italian naval activity in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nMore recently a lighthouse was constructed, but it is now in disuse.\n \nAs the southernmost point of mainland Greece, the cape is on the migration route of birds headed to Africa.\nQuestion:\nIn which country is Cape Matapan?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nAn Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews\nAn Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews, or simply Shamela, as it is more commonly known, is a satirical burlesque, a novella written by Henry Fielding, first published in April 1741 under the name of Mr. Conny Keyber. Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.\n\nPublishing history\n\nShamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.\n\nA pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.\n\nPlot summary\n\nShamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.\n\nThemes and style\n\nThe novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  \n\nRichardson's epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her 'virtue' to battle against her master's attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message \u2013 that a girl's chastity has eventual value as a commodity \u2013 as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding's travesty.\n\nRecent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding's work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson's work, rather than a simple attack.  Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews.\nQuestion:\n\u2018Shamela\u2019 (1741) was a parody of \u2018Pamela\u2019 (1740). Who wrote the latter?\nAnswer:\nSamuel Richardson\nPassage:\nCalcaneus\nIn humans, the calcaneus (; from the Latin calcaneus or calcaneum, meaning heel ) or heel bone is a bone of the tarsus of the foot which constitutes the heel.  In some other animals, it is the point of the hock.\n\nStructure\n\nIn humans, the calcaneus is the largest of the tarsal bones and the largest bone of the foot. The talus bone, calcaneus, and navicular bone are considered the proximal row of tarsal bones. In the calcaneus, several important structures can be distinguished: \n\nThe half of the bone closest to the heel is the calcaneal tubercle. On its lower edge on either side are its lateral and medial processes (serving as the origins of the abductor hallucis and abductor digiti minimi).  The Achilles tendon is inserted into a roughened area on its superior side, the cuboid bone articulates with its anterior side, and on its superior side are three articular surfaces for the articulation with the talus bone.  Between these superior articulations and the equivalents on the talus is the tarsal sinus (a canal occupied by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament). At the upper and forepart of the medial surface of the calcaneus, below the middle talar facet, there is a horizontal eminence, the talar shelf (also sustentaculum tali), which gives attachment to the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament, tibiocalcaneal ligament, and medial talocalcaneal ligament. This eminence is concave above, and articulates with the middle calcaneal articular surface of the talus; below, it is grooved for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus; its anterior margin gives attachment to the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, and its medial margin to a part of the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint.\n\nOn the lateral side is commonly a tubercle called the calcaneal tubercle (or trochlear process). This is a raised projection located between the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. It separates the two oblique grooves of the lateral surface of the calcaneus (for the tendons of the peroneal muscles).\n\nIts chief anatomical significance is as a point of divergence of the previously common pathway shared by the distal tendons of peroneus longus and peroneus brevis en route to their distinct respective attachment sites.\n\nThe calcaneus is part of two joints: the proximal intertarsal joint and the talocalcaneal joint. The point of the calcaneus is covered by the calcanean bursa.\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn the calcaneus, an ossification center is developed during the 4th\u20137th week of fetal development.\n\nFunction\n\nThree muscles attach to the calcaneus: the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris. These muscles are part of the posterior compartment of the leg and aid in walking, running and jumping. Their specific functions include plantarflexion of the foot, flexion of the knee, and steadying the leg on the ankle during standing.\n\nClinical significance\n\nNormally the tibia sits vertically above the calcaneus (pes rectus). If the calcaneal axis between these two bones is turned medially the foot is in an everted position (pes valgus), and if it is turned laterally the foot is in an inverted position (pes varus). \n\n*Calcaneal fracture, also known as Lover's fracture and Don Juan fracture\n\nDisease\n\nThe talar shelf is typically involved in subtalar or talocalcaneal tarsal coalition.\nQuestion:\nWhere is the calcaneus bone?\nAnswer:\nHeels\nPassage:\nAichmophobia\nAichmophobia (pronounced [\u012bk-m\u014d-f\u014d\u2032b\u0113-\u0103]) is a kind of specific phobia, the morbid fear of sharp things,  such as pencils, needles, knives, a pointing finger, or even the sharp end of an umbrella and different sorts of protruding corners or sharp edges in furnitures and building constructions/materials. It is derived from the Greek aichm\u0113 (point) and phobos (fear). This fear may also be referred to as belonephobia or enetophobia.\n\nSometimes this general term is used to refer to what is more specifically called fear of needles, or needle phobia. Fear of needles is the extreme and irrational fear of medical procedures involving injections or hypodermic needles.\n\nNot to be confused with similar condition (Avoidance behavior) the Visual looming syndrome, where the patient does not fear sharp items, but feels pain or discomfort at gazing upon sharp objects nearby.\n\nTreatment \n\nHypnotherapy \n\nThe use of hypnotherapy which is a combination of hypnosis and therapeutic intervention, may help to control or improve the fear of sharp objects, specifically needles.  A technique called systematic desensitization exposes patients to the feared stimuli in gradual degrees while under hypnosis.  This technique has met with mixed levels of success. \n\nDirect conditioning \n\nDirect conditioning is a process used to associate desired behaviour in the subject with positive stimuli. Mary Cover Jones conducted an experiment in which she treated a patient with a fear of rabbits, by gradually moving a rabbit closer to the patient in the presence of the patient's favorite food. This continued until the patient was able to touch the rabbit without fear.  \n\nRare cases causing posttraumatic stress \n\nIn rare cases, exposure to the feared object may cause posttraumatic stress disorder, which again increases the fear of the object as one also gets afraid of getting posttramatic stress. Typically, this is caused by the fear of a small fragment of the feared object getting stuck in the body after exposure.\nQuestion:\nIn medicine, belonephobia is an irrational fear of what?\nAnswer:\nNeedle (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nTenko (TV series)\nTenko  is a television drama, co-produced by the BBC and the ABC.  A total of thirty episodes were produced over three series between 1981 and 1984, followed by a one-off special (which was twice the length of the other episodes), Tenko Reunion, in 1985.\n\nThe series dealt with the experiences of British, Australian and Dutch women who were captured after the Fall of Singapore in February 1942, after the Japanese invasion, and held in a Japanese internment camp on a Japanese-occupied island between Singapore and Australia. Having been separated from their husbands, herded into makeshift holding camps and largely forgotten by the British War Office, the women have to learn to cope with appalling living conditions, malnutrition, disease, violence and death.\n\nBackground\n\nTenko was created by Lavinia Warner after she had conducted research into the internment of nursing corps officer Margot Turner (1910\u20131993) for an edition of This Is Your Life and was convinced of the dramatic potential of the stories of women prisoners of the Japanese.  Aside from the first two episodes, set in Singapore, which were written by Paul Wheeler, the series was written by Jill Hyem and Anne Valery.\n\nOwing to high production costs, only the first two episodes of the first series were filmed on location in Singapore. For the majority of series 1 and 2, set in the camp, the programme was filmed in a specially constructed set in Dorset. Hankley Common was also used. \n\nThe series takes its name from the Japanese word \"tenko\" (\u70b9\u547c/\u3066\u3093\u3053) which means \"roll-call\".  POWs and internees in Japanese-run camps had regular roll-calls, where they had to line up and number off or were counted in Japanese.\n\nMajor characters\n\nThe major characters who featured in all three series and the reunion telemovie were:\n*Marion Jefferson (Ann Bell)\u2014the wife of an army colonel.\n*Beatrice Mason (Stephanie Cole)\u2014a stern, officious doctor.\n*Kate Norris (Claire Oberman)\u2014a brash Australian nurse.\n*Domenica Van Meyer (Elizabeth Chambers)\u2014a vain, selfish Dutch woman.\n*Christina Campbell (Emily Bolton)\u2014a mixed-race (Chinese/Scottish) young woman.\n*Dorothy Bennett (Veronica Roberts)\u2014a young working-class housewife.\n*Sister Ulrica (Patricia Lawrence)\u2014a formidable Dutch nun.\n\nOnly Ann Bell, Stephanie Cole and Claire Oberman appeared in all thirty regular episodes plus the reunion. Episodes were missed by Elizabeth Chambers in Series 1, Emily Bolton in Series 2, Veronica Roberts in Series 1 and 3 and Patricia Lawrence in Series 2 and 3.\n\nDVD release and books\n\nAll three series plus the Reunion Special were released in one DVD box-set in 2011 through Acorn Media UK.\n\nThree paperback books were published in the 1980s. One covering the first series, titled Tenko, while a second called Last Tenko, covered the second and final series. The third book, written by Anne Valery, covered the Reunion. \n\nA book about the making of Tenko called Remembering Tenko by Andy Priestner was published in October 2012.\nQuestion:\nWhat did the term 'Tenko' mean in Japanese prisoner of war camps?\nAnswer:\nRole call\nPassage:\nBritain's smallest songbird decling - Telegraph\nBritain's smallest songbird decling - Telegraph\nWildlife\nBritain's smallest songbird decling\nBritain's smallest bird was almost wiped out by the cold weather this winter,    according to a new survey that found the number of gardens in which    goldcrests were spotted fell by half.\nThe goldcrest saw numbers plummet by three quarters.\u00a0\nBy Louise Gray\n12:54PM BST 16 Jun 2010\nThe declines in the tiny bird, which at just 6g weighs less than a 10p piece, were seen throughout the UK and Ireland as the region battled with the coldest winter for several decades.\nAcross the British Isles, goldcrests were seen in 48 per cent fewer gardens between January and March than on average, with declines reaching 60 per cent in Scotland, the South West and the east of England. The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) said the reduction in the number of gardens where goldcrests were resident over the winter month was an \"early warning\" of possible major declines in the population as a whole - as gardens would be expected to be a refuge for the birds.\nIn winter, they visit gardens in larger numbers to feed on fat-based foods put out by householders, and in the unusually snowy and icy conditions which gripped the UK and Ireland earlier this year they would be expected to be seen in more gardens.\nThe BTO warned the declines in goldcrests in gardens between January and March, observed by people taking part in its year-round weekly Garden BirdWatch, suggest a crash in the population at large.\nDr Tim Harrison, of BTO Garden BirdWatch, said goldcrests were not able to carry much in the way of food reserves and as a result were vulnerable to starvation.\nRelated Articles\nQuestion:\nWhich is Britain's smallest songbird?\nAnswer:\nGoldcrests\nPassage:\nTonic water\nTonic water (or Indian tonic water) is a carbonated soft drink in which quinine is dissolved. Originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, tonic water usually now has a significantly lower quinine content and is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavour. It is often used in mixed drinks, particularly in gin and tonic.\n\nHistory \n\nThe drink gained its name from the effects of its bitter flavouring. The quinine was added to the drink as a prophylactic against malaria, since it was originally intended for consumption in tropical areas of South Asia and Africa, where the disease is endemic. Quinine powder was so bitter that British officials stationed in early 19th Century India and other tropical posts began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858.  The mixed drink gin and tonic also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with gin. \n\nSince 2010, at least four tonic syrups have been released in the United States. Consumers add carbonated water to the syrup to make tonic water; this allows drinkers to vary the intensity of the flavour. \n\nQuinine content \n\nMedicinal tonic water originally contained only carbonated water and a large amount of quinine. However, most tonic water today contains a less significant amount of quinine, and is thus used mostly for its flavor. As a consequence, it is less bitter, and is also usually sweetened, often with high fructose corn syrup or sugar. Some manufacturers also produce diet (or slimline) tonic water, which may contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. Traditional-style tonic water with little more than quinine and carbonated water is less common, but may be preferred by those who desire the bitter flavor.\n\nIn the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limits the quinine content in tonic water to 83 ppm  (83\u00a0mg per liter if calculated by mass), while the daily therapeutic dose of quinine is in the range of 500\u20131000\u00a0mg,  and 10\u00a0mg/kg every eight hours for effective malaria prevention (2100\u00a0mg daily for a 70\u00a0kg adult).  Still, it is often recommended as a relief for leg cramps, but medical research suggests some care is needed in monitoring doses.  Because of quinine's risks, the FDA cautions consumers against using \"off-label\" quinine drugs to treat leg cramps. \n\nUses \n\nTonic water is often used as a drink mixer for cocktails, especially those made with gin or vodka (for example, a gin and tonic). Tonic water with lemon or lime flavour added is known as bitter lemon or bitter lime, respectively. Such soft drinks are more popular in the United Kingdom and Europe than in the United States.\n\nFluorescence \n\nTonic water will fluoresce under ultraviolet light, owing to the presence of quinine. In fact, the sensitivity of quinine to ultraviolet light is such that it will appear visibly fluorescent in direct sunlight.\nQuestion:\nWhich drug can be found in tonic water?\nAnswer:\nChinin\nPassage:\nThe Miracles of Jesus Christ: Water Into Wine (Part One)\nThe Miracles of Jesus Christ: Water Into Wine (Part One)\nThe Miracles of Jesus Christ:\nWater Into Wine (Part One)\nby Martin G. Collins\nForerunner, \"Bible Study,\" November 2006\n2006-11-01\nThe Miracles of Jesus Christ\nseries:\nMore...\nThe first miracle Jesus Christ performs during His ministry is changing water into wine at a marriage feast in Cana ( John 2:1-11 ). When we compare what Christ and Moses each did with water, Jesus' miracle shows the contrast between law and grace. Moses changes water to blood, and Christ changes it into wine. Earlier, in John 1:17 , the apostle John writes, \"For the law was given through Moses, [and] grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\" Moses' turning of water into blood suggests judgment ( Exodus 7:14-17 ), while Jesus' turning of water into wine implies generosity and joy. In John 3:17 , John comments, \"For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world [what the law does to sinners], but that the world through Him might be saved [what grace does for those who repent].\"\nThis miracle demonstrates at the earliest possible time that Christ's ministry would be one of grace and truth, as an extension and complement of the Law and the Prophets ( Matthew 5:17-19 ). Jesus had come to fulfill God's law, that is, to teach it and live it as an example of how to apply it to everyday life ( Luke 24:44-45 ).\n1. Why is John's statement that this miracle was the \"beginning of signs\" by Christ so important? John 2:11 .\nComment: That we are told that the miracle in Cana is the first Jesus performed discredits the false traditions that He worked miracles during the thirty years before His public ministry. It invalidates the miraculous accounts in the apocryphal gospels, which have been excluded from the Bible because of their contradictions to Scripture and their counterfeit nature. All stories about Christ's alleged miracles done prior to His public ministry are false.\n2. Why does Jesus perform His first miracle at a marriage ceremony? John 2:1 .\nComment: Jesus heaps great honor on marriage by using such an event to manifest His glory. The apostle Paul writes, \"Marriage is honorable among all\" ( Hebrews 13:4 ), but society increasingly scorns marriage, a fact clearly seen in rampant premarital sex and divorce upon demand. Like Christ's coming, a wedding is a joyous celebration.\nJesus and at least six of His disciples were invited to the wedding, suggesting that the wedding couple were concerned about the character of their guests. As His blessing and presence are essential to marital happiness, Christ must be involved in our marriages. However, those who desire His involvement must invite Him in. Had Jesus not been invited to this wedding, a serious problem would have marred the marriage feast. We can learn that couples in whose marriage Christ is involved have a great advantage in solving problems that arise later.\n3. Why was running out of wine a problem? John 2:3 .\nComment: Weddings in the ancient Near East included a strong legal side, especially regarding providing the appropriate wedding gift, of which the wedding feast was a part. When the supply of wine failed at this wedding, more than social embarrassment was at stake. The bridegroom and his family could have become financially liable for inadequate wedding provisions. The seriousness of the lack of wine (symbolizing a lack of joy) helps us to appreciate the blessing contained in the miracle Jesus performed ( Ecclesiastes 9:7-9 ).\nThis situation relates to the common problems couples experience in marriage, even among God's people. We cannot always stop problems from developing, but we can overcome them with the help of Christ who dwells in us and therefore within our marriages ( Romans 8:10 ).\n4. Why does Jesus rebuke His mother for her seemingly innocent request? John 2:4 .\nComment: When Jesus reprimands Mary, calling her \"woman\" (gunai) rather than \"mother\" (meter), He implies that He is not conforming to her authority but acting under His Heavenly Father's authority. This statement establishes that Mary, even as His physical mother, has no authority over Jesus, destroying any belief that urges us to pray to Mary to intercede for us. On the two occasions in which Mary is seen intruding in His ministry\u2014here and in Matthew 12:46-50 \u2014Jesus verbally moves her aside. His rebuke censures her assumption of authority she does not have. She also seems to lack the humility with which we must go to God with our requests.\nSince the Father had already predetermined Jesus' agenda, Mary's request is inappropriate because she tries to determine what He should do. The Father would not have let Mary change His plan, so He had probably already inspired Christ to perform this miracle. Obviously, Jesus does not deny Mary a solution, but He does mildly rebuke her for her attitude toward Him and His purpose.\n5. What does Mary's response demonstrate? John 2:5 .\nComment: On behalf of the newlyweds and their families, Mary prudently goes to Jesus to solve their wine problem, emphasizing the value of friends and brethren praying for the marriages of others. The strength of Mary's faith is exhibited when she orders the servants to follow Jesus' instructions, confirming her acceptance of what He had said to her in verse 4. She demonstrates both meekness and faith by expressing a humble attitude. This is what service to Christ is all about, living in obedience to His every word.\n\u00a9 2006 Church of the Great God\nPO Box 471846\nQuestion:\nWhat was the nature of the event at which Jesus turned water into wine\nAnswer:\nCivil wedding\nPassage:\nPotemkin Stairs\nThe Potemkin Stairs, or Potemkin Steps (, Potemkinsky Skhody, ) is a giant stairway in Odessa, Ukraine. The stairs are considered a formal entrance into the city from the direction of the sea and are the best known symbol of Odessa.  The stairs were originally known as the Boulevard steps, the Giant Staircase, p. 32 or the Richelieu steps. p. 119. Referencing  p. 616 p. 18, 25 p. 498 \"The Richelieu Steps in Odessa were renamed the \"Potemkin Steps\"... p. 223 The top step is 12.5 meters (41 feet) wide, and the lowest step is 21.7 meters (70.8 feet) wide. The staircase extends for 142 meters, but it gives the illusion of greater length.  Karakina, p. 31 \"13.4 and 21.7 meters wide\"  The stairs were so precisely constructed as to create an optical illusion. A person looking down the stairs sees only the landings, and the steps are invisible, but a person looking up sees only steps, and the landings are invisible. \n\nHistory\n\nOdessa, perched on a high steppe plateau, needed direct access to the harbor below it. Before the stairs were constructed, winding paths and crude wooden stairs were the only access to the harbor.\n\nThe original 200 stairs were designed in 1825 by F. Boffo, St. Petersburg architects Avraam I. Melnikov and Pot'e.   The staircase cost 800,000 rubles to build.\n\nIn 1837 the decision was made to build a \"monstrous staircase\", which was constructed between 1837 and 1841. An English engineer named Upton supervised the construction. Upton had fled Britain while on bail for forgery. p. 61 Greenish-grey sandstone from the Austrian port of Trieste (now in Italy) was shipped in.\n\nAs erosion destroyed the stairs, in 1933 the sandstone was replaced by rose-grey granite from the Boh area, and the landings were covered with asphalt. Eight steps were lost under the sand when the port was being extended, reducing the number of stairs to 192, with ten landings.\n\nThe steps were made famous in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film The Battleship Potemkin.\n\nOn the left side of the stairs, a funicular railway was built in 1906 to transport people up and down instead of walking.  After 73 years of operation (with breaks caused by revolution and war), the funicular was replaced by an escalator in 1970. The escalator was in turn closed in 1997 but a new funicular was opened on 2 September 2005. \n\nAfter the Soviet revolution, in 1955, the Primorsky Stairs were renamed as Potemkin Stairs to honor the 50th anniversary of the mutiny on the Battleship Potemkin.Karakina, p. 31 After Ukrainian independence, like many streets in Odessa, the previous name \u2013 'Primorsky Stairs' was reinstated to the stairs. Most Odessites still know and refer to the stairs by their Soviet name.\n\nDuke de Richelieu Monument\n\nAt the top of the stairs is the Duke de Richelieu Monument, depicting Odessa's first Mayor.  The Roman-toga figure was designed by the Russian sculptor, Ivan Petrovich Martos (1754\u20131835). The statue was cast in bronze by Yefimov and unveiled in 1826. It is the first monument erected in the city.

The painting depicts the miracle of Jesus calming the storm on the Sea of Galilee, as depicted in the fourth chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament of the Christian Bible.   It is Rembrandt's only seascape.\n\nTheft\n\nOn the morning of March 18, 1990, thieves disguised as police officers broke into the museum and stole The Storm on the Sea of Galilee and 12 other works. It is considered the biggest art theft in US history and remains unsolved.  The museum still displays the paintings' empty frames in their original locations. \n\nOn March 18, 2013, the FBI announced they knew who was responsible for the crime.  Criminal analysis has suggested that the heist was committed by an organized crime group. There have been no conclusions made public as the investigation is ongoing. \n\nIn popular culture \n\nIn The Blacklist episode \"Gina Zanetakos (No. 152)\" (season 1, episode 6), Raymond Reddington has possession of The Storm on the Sea of Galilee and is arranging its sale to a buyer for the buyer's wedding.

The frequency at which the competition has been held and the number of matches played has varied, but , it consists of an annual three-match series, with two of the matches also counting towards The Rugby Championship. New Zealand have had the most success, winning the trophy for the 43rd time in 2015, while Australia have won 12 times.\n\nHistory\n\nThere is some dispute as to when the first Bledisloe Cup match was played. The Australian Rugby Union (ARU) contend that the one-off 1931 match played at Eden Park was first. However, no firm evidence has been produced to support this claim, and minutes from a New Zealand union management meeting several days later record Lord Bledisloe wishing to present a cup for the All Blacks and Wallabies to play for. The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) believe that the first match was when New Zealand toured Australia in 1932.\n\nBetween 1931 and 1981 it was contested irregularly in the course of rugby tours between the two countries. New Zealand won it 19 times and Australia four times in this period including in 1949 when Australia won it for the first time on New Zealand soil. The trophy itself was apparently 'lost' during this period and reportedly rediscovered in a Melbourne store room. In the years 1982 to 1995 it was contested annually, sometimes as a series of three matches (two in 1995) and other times in a single match. During these years New Zealand won it 11 times and Australia three times.\n\nSince 1996 the cup has been contested as part of the annual Tri Nations tournament. Until 1998 the cup was contested in a three match series: the two Tri Nations matches between these sides and a third match. New Zealand won these series in 1996 and 1997, and Australia won it in 1998.\n\nIn 1996 and from 1999 through 2005, the third match was not played; during those years, Australia and New Zealand played each other twice as part of the Tri Nations for the cup. If both teams won one of these games, or if both games were drawn, the cup was retained by its current holder. The non-holder had to win the two games 2\u20130 or 1\u20130 (with a draw) to regain the Cup. A criticism of this system was that with the closeness in the level of ability between the two sides, years where each team won one game each were very common (1999, 2000, 2002, 2004) and in these years, many rugby fans felt dissatisfied with one team keeping the cup in a series tied at 1\u20131.\n\n2006 saw the return of the 3-game contest for the Bledisloe Cup as the Tri Nations series was extended so that each team played each other 3 times. The 2007 Cup, however, reverted to the two-game contest because the Tri Nations was abbreviated that year to minimise interference with the teams' preparations for the World Cup.\n\nIn 2008 it was announced that the Bledisloe Cup would be contested over an unprecedented four matches, with three games played in Australia and New Zealand and a fourth and potentially deciding game in Hong Kong in an effort to promote the game in Asia (the first time Australia and New Zealand played in a third country outside the World Cup).  The Hong Kong match, which drew a crowd of 39,000 to see the All Blacks (which had already clinched the Bledisloe Cup) defeat the Wallabies 19\u201314,  proved to be a financial success for the two unions, generating a reported \u00a35.5\u00a0million.  Even before the match, the two countries' rugby federations were considering taking Cup matches to the United States and Japan in 2009 and 2010. Japan hosted a fourth Bledisloe Test match on 31 October 2009. Each team is expected to clear at least A$3.8\u00a0million/NZ$5\u00a0million from the Tokyo match.  However a 2010 fourth match was set in Hong Kong and has struggled to attract crowds. \n\nThe three-match format for the Bledisloe Cup continued in 2012, with the first two matches taking place as part of the 2012 Rugby Championship.\n\nResults\n\nOverall\n\nMost titles won:\n# New Zealand \u2013 43 \n# Australia \u2013 12\n\nLongest time held by Australia: 5 years (1998\u20132002) (5 Titles)\n\nLongest time held by New Zealand: 28\nyears (1951\u20131978) (12 Titles)\n\nMost titles in a row by New Zealand: (2003\u20132015) (13 Titles)\n\nBy Year \n\nMedia coverage\n\nIn Australia, the Bledisloe Cup was televised between 1992 to 1995 by Network Ten.

There are numerous species of seals, including elephant, fur and leopard varieties.\nFull Answer\nFemale seals deliver one pup each year. The pup nurses from four days to one month, during which time the female does not eat. She uses stored blubber for energy. After weaning, a pup learns to swim and hunt entirely on its own with instinct as his guide. Seals are warm-blooded marine mammals that live in ocean waters at all latitudes.\nQuestion:\nA group of female seals is called what?\nAnswer:\nHougong\nPassage:\nMaria Dickin\nMaria Elisabeth Dickin CBE (nickname, Mia; 22 September 1870 \u2013 1 March 1951) was a social reformer  and an animal welfare pioneer who founded the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) in 1917. Born in 1870 in London, she was the oldest of eight children; her parents were William George Dickin, a Wesleyan minister, and Ellen Maria (n\u00e9e Exell). She married her first cousin, Arnold Francis Dickin, an accountant, in 1899; they had no children. She enjoyed music, literary work and philanthropy. Dickin died in London in 1951 of influenzal broncho-pneumonia. \n\nLegacy\n\nThe Dickin Medal is named after her.\n\nA commemorative blue plaque was erected by English Heritage at Dickin's birthplace, 41 Cassland Road (formerly 1 Farringdon Terrace) in Hackney in October 2015.\nQuestion:\nThe Dickin Medal that bears the words 'For Gallantry' and 'We Also Serve' was instituted in 1943 by Maria Dickin to honour the work of whom/what in war?\nAnswer:\nAnimal Phylogeny\nPassage:\nBoston Tea Party - iBoston.org\nBoston Tea Party - iBoston.org\nDecember 16, 1773\nThree ships lay at Griffin's Wharf in Boston at an impasse. The Dartmouth,         the Elanor and the Beaver were guarded by just over twenty revolutionary         guards to prevent them from being unloaded. Yet Massachusetts Governor,         Thomas Hutchinson, the grandson of Anne Hutchinson would not permit the         ships to depart without unloading.\nLord         Frederick North, England's Prime Minister never expected this tea tax         to cause an outcry, let alone revolution. In 1767 England reduced its         property taxes at home. To balance the national budget they needed to         find a mechanism for the American colonies to pay for the expense of stationing         officials in them. Under the Townshed Act the officials would generate         their own revenue by collecting taxes on all imported goods, and once         paid affixing stamps on them. This Stamp Tax generated more in the way         of protests and smuggling than added revenue.\nWhy tea?\nRecognizing this failure, Lord North repealed the stamp tax in 1773, except         for a reduced tax which remained on tea. This was both out of principal         to maintain the English ability to tax, and to support a national company,         the East India Tea Company, which had suffered revenue loss as nearly         90% of America's tea had been smuggled from foreign lands. This tea would         be the only legally imported tea in the colonies, and old at a discount         below customary prices to curtail smuggling.\nAmerican merchants recognized this monopoly took money from their pockets,         and resisted this tea monopoly. Merchants added to the revolutionary fervor.         Locally the agents of the East India company were pressured to resign         their posts, and ships were sent away unloaded from American coasts.\nFor         a decade Sam Adams had been inspiring revolution, this was his hour. Adams         is widely believed to have orchestrated the Boston Tea Party. A town meeting         was called for the evening of December 16th at Faneuil         Hall . All British eyes were on the meeting, which when it overfilled         Faneuil moved to the larger Old         South Church .\nThere was little notice of a committee which met with Governor Hutchinson         during the meeting, or the messenger who returned with news that no settlement         could be reached. But at that exact moment colonials disguised as Mohawk         Indians boarded the three ships.\nAs John Adams later noted, these were no ordinary Mohawks. They had already         organized themselves into boarding parties who easily took over the merchant         ships and demanded access to the cargo. Discipline prevented the participants         from vandalizing the ships, or stealing tea for personal consumption.         They destroyed 14,000 British pounds of tea, which equates to over one         million dollars in today's currency.\nLord North's reaction was fierce. 3,000 British soldiers were sent to         Boston, which equalled one fifth of the town's population. Boston's port         was closed except for military ships, self governance was suspended. In         order to house these troops, rights were given to soldiers to quarter         themselves in any unoccupied colonial building. The Old South Church,         the point were the teaparty was launched was gutted by the British and         converted to a riding arena and pub for troops.\nBy January of 1775 it was clear to Lord North that revolution was at hand.         He sent a peace making delegation offering to end all taxes provided the         colonies promised to pay the salaries of civil authorities regularly.         But it was too late. Events now overtook the hope of a peaceful reconciliation.         That spring, on April 16th the American Crisis turned into the American         Revolution, and Lord North tendered his resignation.\nKing George refused North's resignation, as he would for the duration         of the American Revolutionary war. Lord North would ultimately be known         as the Prime Minister who lost England's American colonies.\nINTRODUCING\nQuestion:\nWho was British Prime Minister at the time of 'The Boston Tea Party'?\nAnswer:\nLORD(Frederick)NORTH\n", "answers": ["Brighthelmstone", "UN/LOCODE:GBBSH", "Brighton music", "Brighton Ferry", "Brighton, UK", "Brighton, Sussex", "Mayor of Brighton", "Brighton, East Sussex", "Brighton Borough Council", "County Borough of Brighton", "Brighton, England", "Brighton"], "pred": "O.

Since the Hopman Cup was founded in 1989, it has been attended each year by Harry Hopman's widow, his second wife Lucy, who travels to the tournament annually from her home in the United States. \n\nThe tournament is a sanctioned event in the calendar of the International Tennis Federation (ITF), but individual player results are not included in the calculation of the tennis world rankings. The competition receives extensive television coverage in Australia and is an important lead-up tournament to the Australian Open each January as part of the Australian Open Series. The winning team receives a silver cup perpetual trophy and up to 2014 the winning team members were presented with distinctive individual trophies in the shape of a tennis ball encrusted with diamonds from the Argyle diamond mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.  In 2014 and 2015, the individual trophies were created in the shape of an intricate diamond encrusted tennis racket and ball, using just under an ounce of 18-carat white, yellow and rose gold and approximately half an ounce of pink argyle diamonds.

(The \"last\" team may be decided by play-offs between several nations before competition begins. For the 2007 Hopman Cup however, this did not occur, due to the Asian Qualifying Tournament creating the eighth team. The official tournament website also has no qualifier listed in its schedule.)\n\nEach team consists of one male player and one female player. Each match-up between two teams at the championships consists of:\n* one women's singles match\n* one men's singles match\n* one mixed doubles match\n\nThe eight competing teams are separated into two groups of four (with two teams being seeded) and face-off against each of the other three teams in their group in a round-robin format.

During the peace talks between the 13 colonies of the United States of America and the Kingdom of Great Britain that would culminate in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, he served as a Secretary to David Hartley; while in Paris, he also learned some French. Subsequently, Hammond was appointed charg\u00e9 d'affaires at Vienna from 1788 to 1790, spent part of 1790 in Copenhagen, and in 1791 found himself Counsellor of Legation at Madrid.\n\nMinister to the United States\n\nDespite American grumbles over the lack of a British envoy since the peace treaty concluded the American revolution in 1783, the decision for the British was by no means a simple one. The Articles of Confederation lacked both a fixed seat of government and single leader to accredit an envoy, and few qualified diplomats desired the post and its yearly salary of \u00a32500. David Hartley, himself approached for the position, recommended his former secretary Hammond to Charles Jenkinson, who in turn passed on the name to newly appointed Foreign Secretary William Grenville. Hammond was soon given the job, boarded a ship for Philadelphia in September 1791 along with Edward Thornton, secretary of legation, and arrived five weeks later on 20 October.\n\nHammond initially met with then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, but waited to formally present himself to President George Washington before an American Minister to England was chosen; his reception on 11 November 1791 formally established relations between the two countries. Although Hammond described his situation as \"new, critical and rather embarrassing\", he also stated that \"If I accepted a quarter of the invitations to dinner and tea parties which I receive I should have little time for business\", and said of the leading families that \"I have reason to think most of them are Tories at heart.\"\n\nHammond had four children, aged oldest to youngest: William Andrew, George, Margaret, Edmund.

His son, Edmund Hammond, would also join the Foreign Office.\n\nHammond left his post on 14 August 1795, leaving the consul general at Philadelphia, Phineas Bond, in charge until Robert Liston arrived in America.\n\nLater career\n\nFollowing his return from the United States, Hammond became an Undersecretary at the Foreign Office. In this position he advised and befriended Grenville and met George Canning; Canning founded the newspaper the Anti-Jacobin in 1797, and Hammond acted as joint-editor.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nPurlin\nIn architecture, structural engineering or building, a purlin (or historically purline, purloyne, purling, perling) is any longitudinal, horizontal, structural member in a roof except a type of framing with what is called a crown plate. In traditional timber framing there are three basic types of purlin: purlin plate, principal purlin and common purlin.\n\nPurlin plates in wooden construction\n\nA purlin plate in wooden construction is also called an \"arcade plate\" in European English,  \"under purlin\", and \"principal purlin\". The term plate means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. Purlin plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and are supported by posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. Purlin plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America. A crown plate has similarities to a purlin plate but supports collar beams in the middle of a timber framed building.\n\nPrincipal purlins in wood construction\n\nPrincipal purlins in wood construction, also called \"major purlin\", \"side purlin\". Principal purlins are supported by principal rafters and support common rafters in what is known as a \"double roof\" (a roof framed with a layer of principal rafters and a layer of common rafters). Principal purlins are further classified by how they connect to the principal rafters:  \"Through purlins\" pass over the top; \"butt purlins\" tenon into the sides of the principal rafters; \"clasped purlins,\" of which only one historic U.S. example is known,) are captured by a collar beam. Through purlins are further categorized as trenched, back, or clasped; butt purlins are classified as threaded, tenoned, and/or staggered. \n\nCommon purlins in wood construction\n\nCommon purlins in wood construction, also called a \"major-rafter minor-purlin system\".  Common purlins are typically \"trenched through\" the top sides (backs) of principal rafters and carry vertical roof sheathing (The key to identifying this type of roof system). Common purlin roofs in North America are found in areas settled by Englishmen and may have been a new invention in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. No examples of framed buildings with common purlin roofs have been reported in England, however some stone barns in England have vertically boarded, common purlin roofs. Historically, these roofs are found in New England, the highest concentration in Maine, and isolated parts of New York and along the St. Lawrence River in Canada. One of the oldest extant (surviving) examples is in the Coffin House in Newbury, Massachusetts from 1678. The purpose of a common purlin roof may be they allow a board roof, that is a roof of nothing but vertically laid boards with seams covered with battens or another layer of boards. \n\nSteel construction\n\nIn steel construction, the term purlin typically refers to roof framing members that span parallel to the building eave, and support the roof decking or sheeting.  The purlins are in turn supported by rafters or walls. Purlins are most commonly used in Metal Building Systems, where Z-shapes are utilized in a manner that allows flexural continuity between spans.\n\nIt is the practice in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: Channel sections, with or without flange stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; Channel sections without flange stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently cold-formed steel C, Z or U sections, (or mill rolled) C sections.\n\nCold formed members can be efficient on a weight basis relative to mill rolled sections for secondary member applications. Additionally, Z sections can be nested for transportation bundling and, on the building, lapped at the supports to develop a structurally efficient continuous beam across multiple supports.\n\nEtymology\n\nInformation on the origin of the term \"purlin\" is scant. The Oxford Dictionary suggests a French origin, with the earliest quote using a variation of purlin in 1447.\n\nGallery\n\nNote: The sketches in this section reference terminology commonly used in the UK and Australia.  \n\nFile:Rf-trad-section.gif| A section though lightweight timber frame construction showing the position of under purlins.\nImage:Metal-purlins.jpg|Roll formed metal roof purlins.

It follows the lives of a group of Royal Navy sailors fighting the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II.\nIt contains seven chapters, each describing a year during the war.\n\nThe novel, based on the author's experience of serving in corvettes in the North Atlantic in World War II, gives a matter-of-fact but moving portrayal of ordinary men learning to fight and survive in a violent, exhausting battle against the elements and a ruthless enemy.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe action commences in 1939. Lieutenant-Commander George Ericson, a Merchant Navy and Royal Naval Reserve officer, is recalled to the Royal Navy and given command of the fictitious Flower-class corvette HMS Compass Rose, newly built to escort convoys. His officers are mostly new to the Navy, especially the two new sub-lieutenants, Lockhart and Ferraby. Only Ericson and the petty officers are in any way experienced.\n\nDespite these initial disadvantages, the ship and crew work up a routine and gain experience. Bennett, the first lieutenant, a mean and shirking disciplinarian with a penchant for bullying and canned sausages (snorkers), leaves the ship ostensibly for health reasons, and the junior officers are able to mature, with Lockhart gaining promotion to first lieutenant.\n\nThe crew cross the Atlantic many times on escort duty in all kinds of weather, often encountering fierce storms in one of the smallest ships to provide escort services to the Allied convoys. The men endure the ship's constant rolling and pitching in the huge waves, freezing cold, the strain of maintaining station on the convoy on pitch-black nights and the fear that at any second a torpedo from a German U-boat could blow them to oblivion. Somehow the tradition of the Royal Navy and the knowledge of the importance of their work carries them through.\n\nThey continue the monotonous and dangerous but vital duty of convoy escort and after one particularly difficult convoy they use all their hard won knowledge to sink a German submarine. \nThey are nearly sunk several times until in 1943 they are finally torpedoed and forced to abandon ship. Most of the crew die in the freezing waters, but Ericson, Lockhart, Ferraby, and a few others are rescued the next day, but Ferraby suffers a break down forcing him to go to hospital.\n\nEricson, now promoted to commander, and Lockhart, now a lieutenant-commander, take command of a new ship, the fictitious River class frigate HMS Saltash. (In the film adaptation, the ship is called Saltash Castle and is portrayed by the Castle class corvette HMS Portchester Castle, as no River class vessels were available.)\n\nThe Royal Navy is now finally gaining the upper hand over the U-boats and Saltash adds to the growing number of kills due to Ericson's determination and patience.\n\nIn chapter seven the ship receives a message ordering it to \"remain on patrol in vicinity of Rockall\" as the end of the Second World War approaches in 1945, a well-known quote.\n\nWhen the war ends, the ship returns to port as a guard to several German submarines that have surrendered.\n\nA secondary plotline concerns Lockhart's poignant romance with a beautiful Women's Royal Naval Service officer.\n\nOrigins\n\nNicholas Monsarrat's own career was the model for that of his character Lockhart, a Fleet Street reporter in the 1930s, commissioned as a naval reservist.  Monsarrat spent the war in anti-submarine escort ships, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Commander.  His first book, Three Corvettes was published in 1945.  After the war he was a publicity officer at British missions overseas (notably Ottawa) before becoming a full-time writer.\n\nFilm and radio adaptations\n\nThe novel was  made into the film The Cruel Sea in 1953, directed by Charles Frend and starring Jack Hawkins as Commander Ericson and Donald Sinden as Lockhart.\n\nBBC Radio 4 has produced two radio adaptations of the book. In September 1980, a two-hour  dramatised version starred Richard Pasco as Ericson and Michael N. Harbour as Lockhart, and with Terry Molloy as the Coxswain of Saltash. Recording took place with the assistance of the captain and ship's company of HMS Brighton and the captain of HMS Scylla. The narrator was Martin Muncaster. In March 2012, another two hour version, starred Gwilym Lee as Lockhart and Jonathan Coy as Ericson. Dramatised by John Fletcher and directed by Marc Beeby, this adaptation went on to win 'Best Use of Sound in an Audio Drama' in the BBC Audio Drama Awards 2013.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the WW11 novel 'The Cruel Sea'?\nAnswer:\nNicholas Monsarrat\nPassage:\nThree Times a Lady\n\"Three Times a Lady\" is a song by American soul group the Commodores, from their 1978 album Natural High. It was produced by James Anthony Carmichael and the Commodores. It was also the only Motown song to reach the Top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 that year and the Commodores's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit, topping the chart for two weeks on August 12, 1978 and also went to number one the soul chart for two weeks.   The song spent three weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart. \n\nThe song also reached #1 on the Canadian RPM Singles Chart for four weeks, and was one of only a few Motown singles to reach the top spot in the UK Singles Chart, staying there for five weeks.  The song was also successful in Ireland, staying at #1 in the charts for three consecutive weeks. It was #1 in Australia for five weeks, and reached #2 in New Zealand.\n\nThe original Commodores' version of the song was included as the final track on Lionel Richie's greatest hits compilation album Back To Front, released in 1992.\n\nIn an appearance on The Early Show on June 12, 2009, Lionel Richie said he was inspired to write the song because of a comment his father made about his mother. His father said to his mother \"I love you. I want you. I need you. Forever\" hence the three times a lady. \n\nCovers\n\n* Nate Harvell recorded one of the first country versions in 1978, reaching #23 on the Billboard country chart.\n* The song was also covered in the country genre by country singer Billy \"Crash\" Craddock on his 1986 album Crash Craddock and in 2007 by Cobra Starship as an iTunes bonus track for their album \u00a1Viva La Cobra!. In 2001 it was covered by Anglo-Norwegian boy band a1 and featured on Motown Mania and as a bonus track on their hit single \"No More\".\n* The Shadows did an instrumental of the song on Moonlight Shadows (1986).\n* Kenny Rogers covered the song on After Dark.  It was also featured on his hits compilation All The Hits And All New Love Songs.  Rogers performed the song on the Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters television show on November 29, 1980.\n* The most successful cover version was performed by Conway Twitty, whose version appears on his 1983 album Lost in the Feeling. Twitty's version reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in the late winter of 1984.  Allmusic reviewer Tom Jurek wrote that \"Three Times a Lady\" and the previous single, \"Heartache Tonight\" \"offer(ed) a solid view of Twitty's amazing crossover potential, and his ability to take well-known pop tracks and turn them into solid country smashes long after the countrypolitan days of Chet Atkins and RCA.\"  (In addition to \"Heartache Tonight\" (a cover of a song by The Eagles), Twitty had successfully covered \"Slow Hand\" and \"The Rose,\" previously pop hits for the Pointer Sisters and Bette Midler, respectively.)\nQuestion:\nWhat group had their first UK hit with three times a lady ?\nAnswer:\nWalter Orange\nPassage:\nConcertgebouw\nThe Royal Concertgebouw (,) is a concert hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The Dutch term \"concertgebouw\" literally translates into English as \"concert building\". On 11 April 2013, on occasion of the building's 125th anniversary, Queen Beatrix bestowed the Royal Title \"Koninklijk\" upon the building, as she did previously (in 1988) to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.  Because of its highly regarded acoustics, the Concertgebouw is considered one of the finest concert halls in the world, along with places such as Boston's Symphony Hall   and the Musikverein in Vienna.\n\nHistory\n\nThe architect of the building was Adolf Leonard van Gendt, who was inspired by the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, built two years earlier (and destroyed in 1943).\n\nConstruction began in 1883 in a pasture that was then outside the city, in Nieuwer-Amstel, a municipality that in 1964 became Amstelveen.  A total of 2,186 piles of length twelve to thirteen metres (40 to 43\u00a0ft) were sunk into the soil.\n\nThe hall opened on 11 April 1888 with an inaugural concert, in which an orchestra of 120 musicians and a chorus of 500 singers participated, performing works of Wagner, Handel, Bach, and Beethoven. The resident orchestra of the Concertgebouw is the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest), which gave its first concert in the hall on 3 November 1888, as the Concertgebouw Orchestra (Concertgebouworkest). For many decades the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra and the Radio Filharmonisch Orkest have also been regular performers in the Concertgebouw.\n\nThe Main Hall (Grote Zaal) seats 1,974, and is 44 metres (144\u00a0ft) long, 28 metres (92\u00a0ft) wide, and 17 metres (56\u00a0ft) high.  Its reverberation time is 2.8 seconds without audience, 2.2 seconds with, making it ideal for the late Romantic repertoire such as Mahler. Though this characteristic makes it largely unsuited for amplified music, groups such as Led Zeppelin, The Who and Pink Floyd performed there in the 1960s. It hosts not only orchestral and operatic performances, but also jazz and world music.\n\nA smaller, oval-shaped venue, the Recital Hall (Kleine Zaal), is located behind the Main Hall. The Recital Hall is 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) long and 15 metres (50\u00a0ft) wide. Its more intimate space is well-suited for chamber music and Lieder. The Recital Hall has 437 seats.\n\nWhen the Concertgebouw was built, acoustics were something of a black art. As in shipbuilding, designers drew upon what had worked in the past without entirely understanding the underlying science. When the building was completed, the acoustics were not perfect, and a lot of effort went into fine-tuning the aural ambience. During later restorations, particular care has been taken not to alter the materials used for interior decoration with this in mind. In the 1980s, the hall embarked on extensive fund-raising for renovations after the hall was found to be slowly sinking into the ground. Pi de Bruijn was the architect for the contemporary annex to the original hall. \n\nToday, some nine hundred concerts and other events per year take place in the Concertgebouw, for a public of over 700,000, making it one of the most-visited concert halls in the world. \n\n, the managing director of the Concertgebouw is Simon Reinink and the artistic director is Anneke Hogenstijn. \n\nOrgan \n\nThe organ was built in 1890 by the organ builder Michael Maarschalkerweerd from Utrecht, and was renovated in the years 1990-1993 by the organ builder Flentrop. It has 60 registers on three divisions and pedal. \n\n* Couplers: II/I (also as Suboktavkoppel), III/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P\n\nNames of composers in the Main Hall\n\nIn the Main Hall, the surnames of the following 46 composers are displayed on the balcony ledges and on the walls: \n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe Concertgebouw is mentioned, along with Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl, and the Rainbow Theatre, in the song \"Rock Show\" from the 1975 Wings album Venus and Mars.\n\nKris Debruyne, a Belgian singer, mentions the Concertgebouw in his song \"Amsterdam\".\n\nGallery\n\nFile:A.L. van Gendt Concertgebouw 0.jpg|Architectural drawings of the design, dated 1888.\nImage:Jacob Olie - Concertgebouw Amsterdam 10 november 1902.jpeg|The Concertgebouw in 1902.\nImage:Concert18.jpg|The Main Hall (Grote Zaal) of the Concertgebouw.\nImage:ConcertgebouwMuseumpleinAmsterdam.jpg|The Concertgebouw at night, 2008.\nImage:Concertgebouw-july2010.jpg|A piano quintet concert in the Main Hall, July 2010.\nQuestion:\nThe home of The Royal Concertgebouw is in which city?\nAnswer:\nClassis of Amsterdam\nPassage:\nJosephine Wayne\nJosephine S. Wayne (born Josephine Alicia Saenz; May 13, 1908 \u2013 June 24, 2003) was the first wife of American film actor John Wayne. She had four children including film producer Michael Wayne and actor Patrick Wayne.\n\nBiography\n\nJosephine Alicia \"Josie\" Saenz was born May 13, 1908 to the Consul General of Panama in the United States,  Jos\u00e9 Saenz, a wealthy businessman who lived in Los Angeles, California.  Her parents were born in Madrid, Spain.\nAged 15 or 16 when she met John Wayne, an actor in college still named Marion Morrison, while at a beach party in Balboa, California. Their relationship met with considerable resistance from her Catholic family because he was a Presbyterian. \n \n\nMarriage\n\nAfter courting for seven years, Wayne's financial status improved considerably due to his success at the box office, and he was able to convince her family to allow the marriage. The couple married on June 24, 1933, in a garden ceremony at actress Loretta Young's home. \n\nThe couple had four children: Michael Wayne (film producer, November 23, 1934 \u2013 April 2, 2003), Mary Antonia \"Toni\" Morrison-LaCava (February 25, 1936 \u2013  December 6, 2000), Patrick Wayne (born July 15, 1939) and Melinda Morrison-Mu\u00f1oz (born December 3, 1940).\n\nAfter a few years, the marriage was in trouble. Wayne worked long hours at his career and was always surrounded by associates from the film world. The couple also had differences of opinion about how their children should be raised.  In 1943 they separated and eventually divorced in 1945.  She also found great happiness in 1996 when she married Cyril Nigg (died March, 1999 ), a well known Los Angeles businessman, who shared her love of service to the community.\n\nDeath\n\nJosephine Saenz died in 2003, at age 95, from cancer, having been predeceased by two of her children, Michael and Toni.\nQuestion:\nWhich very famous actor had three wives, Josephine Alicia Saenz, Esperanza Baur and Pilar Pallete?\nAnswer:\nMichael Morris (John Wayne)\nPassage:\npangram:\nPangram\npangram:\nPangram (  p\u00e6ngr\u00e6m )  [f.

They are used to spear, hook, move or otherwise act on other objects.  They may be made of metal, wood, bone or other hard, strong material.\n\nThe number of tines (also written tynes) on tools varies widely \u2013 a pitchfork may have just two, a garden fork may have four, and a rake or harrow many.  Tines may be blunt, such as those on a fork used as an eating utensil; or sharp, as on a pitchfork; or even barbed, as on a trident. The terms \"tine\" and \"prong\" are mostly interchangeable. A tooth of a comb is a tine.\n\nTines and prongs occur in nature\u2014for example, forming the branched bony antlers of deer or the forked horns of pronghorn antelopes. The term \"tine\" is also used for mountains, such as the fictional Silvertine in The Lord of the Rings.\n\nIn chaos theory (physics, non-linear dynamics), the branches of a bifurcation diagram are called tines and subtines.\nQuestion:\nWhat is a prong of a fork called\nAnswer:\nTine\nPassage:\nList of association football teams to have won four or more trophies in one season\nIn a football season, clubs typically compete in a number of different competitions: usually a domestic league and at least one cup competition, as well as sometimes competing in continental football, that is, the tournaments organised by one of FIFA's six confederations. Winning multiple competitions is seen as a particularly momentous achievement. \n\nDoubles and trebles are usually long-remembered achievements, but do occur with some level of frequency.  By contrast, winning four or more trophies in one season is exceptionally rare. In recent years, the terms quadruple, quintuple and sextuple have come to be occasionally used to refer to winning four, five or six top-tier trophies in a single season.     \n\nThe list below considers only teams whose victories include trophies in the top tier of their league system.\n\nFour titles in one season\n\nSome clubs have won four competitions in a single season. This has sometimes been called a 'quadruple'.\n\nOther teams have won four competitions in a calendar year, though not all in the same season.\n\nFive titles in one season\n\nOther teams have won five competitions in a calendar year, though not all in the same season. Liverpool achieved this in 2001, winning all competitions entered with the exception of the domestic league title;  Internazionale achieved this feat in 2010 (no UEFA Super Cup), Spanish club F.C. Barcelona achieved this in 2011 (all but 2010\u201311 Copa del Rey) and 2015 (all but 2015 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a);  Germany's FC Bayern Munich won five trophies in 2013 (everything but the DFL-Supercup). \n\nSix titles in a season\n\nBarcelona won six titles in 2009 (Copa del Rey, La Liga, UEFA Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup)  has been described as a 'sextuple'; however, this achievement took place over the course of two different Spanish seasons, winning a treble in the 2008\u201309 season.   It is counted together by many as the three added trophies were extra matches of the treble won, played in the same calendar year.\n\nSeven titles in a season\nQuestion:\nWhich football club was the first to win the sextuple of all possible major competitions?\nAnswer:\nThe weather in Barcelona\nPassage:\nYou (S Club 7 song)\n\"You\" was the 9th single released by UK pop group S Club 7 on 11 February 2002. The track is a very uptempo-retro number reminiscent of the group's third single \"You're My Number One\". The video was set in the 1950s and is described in the Best CD booklet as the \"candyfloss-bright, tongue-in-cheek 50s pastiche\". This track was the last single to feature departed band member Paul Cattermole and sparked the last leg of the S Club 7 journey. The song reached no. 2 on the UK Singles Chart.

Hole is a brilliant and driven detective with unorthodox methods, a classic loose cannon in the police force.\n\nCharacter\n\nHarry Hole, a police officer with the Oslo Crime Squad, lost his mother, a descendant of the Sami people, to cancer while he was in his twenties, and he has never had a close relationship to his father, Olav Hole, a former teacher. He was born in 1965, and has a younger sister with Down syndrome. He is unmarried, but has had close relationships with a number of women throughout the series of ten novels. Otherwise, he has few close friends \u2013 and the ability to make enemies from amongst his colleagues who, nevertheless, grudgingly respect him.\n\nHole is a heavy smoker and an alcoholic although, at times, his alcoholism is under control. The effects of his problem sometimes bring him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues, but Bjarne M\u00f8ller, head of Hole's department and one of his closest friends, manages to prevent him from being sacked as a result, primarily because he recognises that Harry Hole is a brilliant detective who is recognised amongst his colleagues because of his role in the solving the case of a serial killer in Australia. Hole is one of few in the force who has undergone special training in police interrogation techniques and firearms by the FBI.\n\nHole has few friends within the Oslo Police Department, exceptions being some staff at the forensics division of the Norwegian police, including Beate L\u00f8nn, whom he often uses to secure crucial information in critical situations where specialist knowledge is required, and Bj\u00f8rn Holm, another skilled forensics officer. Harry is also friendly with Gunnar Hagen, his former senior officer prior to the case chronicled in Phantom.\n\nIn many ways, the author's home city of Oslo has the starring role in the Harry Hole novels. Much of the background detail of the stories involves real locations, and the city is shown \"warts and all\", ranging from Hole's favourite eating and drinking places that he frequents, to the traffic of the so-called \"Traffic Machine\" road system, the real-life headquarters of the Police Department, the swimming pool at Frogner Park, to the haunts of neo-Nazis, drug addicts and prostitutes, all of this described vividly (in the various novels) at different times of the year \u2013 in the snow and freezing weather of winter to the high temperatures of a particularly warm summer. Harry Hole's friends and acquaintances include city residents from every social background, including immigrants from other parts of the world to old school friends such as \u00d8ystein Eikeland, the taxi driver \u2013 possibly the person with whom he is closest.\n\nHarry Hole's home address is in Sofies Gate in Bislett, Oslo. In Phantom he no longer lives here, as he has been in Hong Kong for three years. Near his place of residence is his favourite \"watering hole\", Restaurant Schr\u00f8der (Schr\u00f8der's, for short) in St. Hanshaugen, which figures in most of the novels. He has had a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke, whose son, Oleg, looks up to Harry as a father figure. After the case chronicled in The Snowman, their relationship is put under severe pressure.\n\n\"Hole\", Harry's family name, is the name of a historic Norwegian town (Hole, Norway), with a heritage that goes back to Norway's origins in the Viking Age. The name is derived from Old Norse H\u00f3lar, the plural form of h\u00f3ll, meaning \"round (and isolated) hill\".

It is a deliberate weak link in a circuit which will 'blow' if an electrical appliance or extension lead draws too much current due to either an overload or a fault. The blown fuse cuts off the electricity to stop the lead and appliance from overheating and causing a fire.\nAppliances meeting the relevant product safety standards will always be fitted with a plug having a correctly-rated fuse. If you have to replace a fuse, it's essential, having checked and corrected the reason for the fuse blowing, to replace it only with another of the same rating.\nAs a rule of thumb, fuses are rated according to the power rating of the appliance. Plugs for appliances rated up to about 700 watts should have a 3 amp fuse (coloured red).\u00a0 Plugs for appliances rated between about 700 watts and 3000 watts (the maximum rating of a wall socket) should be fitted with a 13 amp fuse (coloured brown).

The company is the sixteenth largest brewer in the UK by market share, and the second largest brewer under family ownership after Shepherd Neame.\n\nHistory\n\nT&R Theakston Ltd. was founded in 1827 by Robert Theakston and John Wood at The Black Bull pub and brewhouse in Masham. By 1832 Theakston had sole ownership of the brewery and in 1875 he passed control over to his son Thomas who expanded the range of buildings by building the new brewery on the Paradise Fields.\n\nIn 1919 the company acquired and closed down the Lightfoot Brewery, also in Masham.\n\nTheakston's expanded into Cumbria in 1974 buying the Carlisle State Management Brewery.  The brewery had been owned and operated by the government since 1916.  However the site was a financial drain  on Theakston's and led to the company being taken over in 1984 by Blackburn based brewer, Matthew Brown plc.   Matthew Brown was itself taken over by Scottish & Newcastle in 1987.\n\nPaul Theakston (Managing Director since 1968) left Theakston's in 1988, and in 1992 established the Black Sheep Brewery in the old Lightfoot Brewery premises - located adjacent to the White Bear Hotel, one of Theakston's pubs.\n\nThe Carlisle brewery was closed in 1987, and brewing of some Theakston beers was transferred to Scottish & Newcastle's Tyne Brewery.\n\nIn 2004 the business returned to family ownership after being purchased back from Scottish & Newcastle by four Theakston brothers.  Major development works at the Masham Brewery enabled the company to announce that brewing of Theakston Bitter would return to Masham in 2009. \n\nBeers\n\nThe company produces cask ale and pasteurised bottled ales. Theakston cask ales are widely available in pubs in the north of England, though are less common in other parts of the country. The bottled beers are also widely distributed to British supermarkets and exported to Germany and the United States.\n\nThe company produces five regular cask ales and six seasonal. Only two of the beers are filtered and pasteurised to be made available in bottles, Theakston XB and Old Peculier.\n\nBest Bitter (3.8% ABV) is regularly paired with XB in pubs, Theakston Best Bitter is the company's most easily found product, served in many pubs, mainly in the north of England.\n\nXB (4.5% ABV) is a premium strength Bitter with a more complex flavour. It was launched in 1982.[http://www.barnsleycamra.org.uk/thebar/1992/april-1992.pdf \"Barnley's Bitter - Brewery News\"], Barnsleycamra.org.uk, April\u2013May 1992. Retrieved 28 November 2011\n\nBlack Bull Bitter (3.9% ABV) was brewed to commemorate the Theakson's first pub where the first Theakston's beers were brewed and sold.\n\nTraditional Mild (3.5% ABV) is the weakest beer produced by Theakston, a dark and dry drink created as an alternative for dark ales. It was launched in 1992.\n\nLightfoot Bitter (4.1%abv) originally brewed as a seasonal bitter but with its high popularity has become one of many regular Theakstons brew. Golden in colour and bitter in taste, a favourite in many s&n public houses.\n\nOld Peculier (5.6% ABV) is Theakston's most famous beer. Old Peculier has been made under this name since  the 1890s. In 2000, it won the silver medal in the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)'s \"Champion Winter Beer of Britain\" 2000 competition. The label on the bottle describes it as a \"full bodied, rich, smooth tasting ale with a mysterious and distinctive flavour\". It is named after the peculier of Masham, a peculier being a parish outside the jurisdiction of a diocese. In 1985 The Economist dubbed it the \"doyen of real ales.\" \n\nThe six seasonal ales are Cooper's Butt (4.3% ABV), Hogshead Bitter (4.1% ABV), Grouse Beater (4.2% ABV), Masham Ale (6.5% ABV) and Paradise Ale (4.2% ABV).\n\nVisitor Centre\n\nThe brewery also runs a small visitor centre at its home in Masham where guided tours are given about the actual working brewery. At the end of the tour, visitors are given tokens that can be exchanged for drinks at the bar of the Black Bull in Paradise, named after the original pub (Black Bull) and the location of the new brewery (Paradise Fields). There is also a small shop, selling crates of bottled XB and Old Peculier, beer glasses, T-shirts and an assortment of other souvenirs.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIn the All Creatures Great and Small episode \"Golden Lads & Girls\", James Herriot and Tristan Farnon are seen drinking a Theakston Nutty Brown Ale.\n\nIn The Shadow of Israphel there is a character named Old Peculier.\n\nIn Martha Grimes' Richard Jury novels, the character of Melrose Plant prefers Old Peculier.\nQuestion:\nWhich English brewery produces a beer called 'Old Peculiar'?\nAnswer:\nTheakstons\nPassage:\nI Whistle a Happy Tune\n\"I Whistle a Happy Tune\" is a show tune from the 1951 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, The King and I.

It is a portrait of Sue Tilley, then weighing about 127 kg,  a Job Centre supervisor. Tilley is the author of a biography of the Australian performer Leigh Bowery titled Leigh Bowery, The Life and Times of an Icon. Tilley was introduced to Freud by Bowery, who was already modelling for him. Freud painted a number of large portraits of her around the period 1994\u201396, and came to call her \"Big Sue\". He said of her body \"It's flesh without muscle and it has developed a different kind of texture through bearing such a weight-bearing thing\".  \n\nThe painting held the world record for the highest price paid for a painting by a living artist when it was sold by Guy Naggar  for US$33.6 million (\u00a317.2 million)  at Christie's in New York in May 2008 to Roman Abramovich.

It has been largely supplanted by the contact process.\n\nIn 1746 in Birmingham, England, John Roebuck began producing sulfuric acid in lead-lined chambers, which were stronger, were less expensive, and could be made much larger than the glass containers which had been used previously. This allowed the effective industrialization of sulfuric acid production and, with several refinements, this process remained the standard method of production for almost two centuries. So robust was the process that as late as 1946, the chamber process still accounted for 25% of sulfuric acid manufactured. \n\nProcess \n\nSulfur dioxide is introduced with steam and nitrogen oxide into large chambers lined with sheet lead where the gases are sprayed down with water and chamber acid. The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve and over a period of approximately 30 minutes the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfuric acid. The presence of nitrogen dioxide is necessary for the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate. The process is highly exothermic, and a major consideration of the design of the chambers was to provide a way to dissipate the heat formed in the reactions.\n\nEarly plants used very large lead-lined wooden rectangular chambers (Faulding box chambers) that were cooled by ambient air. The internal lead sheathing served to contain the corrosive sulfuric acid and to render the wooden chambers waterproof. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, such plants required about half a cubic meter of volume to process the sulfur dioxide equivalent of a kilogram of burned sulfur.  In the mid-19th century, French chemist Gay-Lussac redesigned the chambers as stoneware packed masonry cylinders. In the 20th century, plants using Mills-Packard chambers supplanted the earlier designs. These chambers were tall tapered cylinders that were externally cooled by water flowing down the outside surface of the chamber.\n\nSulfur dioxide for the process was provided by burning elemental sulfur or by the roasting of sulfur-containing metal ores in a stream of air in a furnace. During the early period of manufacture, nitrogen oxides were produced by the decomposition of niter at high temperature in the presence of acid, but this process was gradually supplanted by the air oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide in the presence of a catalyst.  The recovery and reuse of oxides of nitrogen was an important economic consideration in the operation of a chamber process plant.\n\nIn the reaction chambers, nitric oxide reacts with oxygen to produce nitrogen dioxide.  Liquid from the bottom of the chambers is diluted and pumped to the top of the chamber and sprayed downwards in a fine mist. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are absorbed in the liquid and react to form sulfuric acid and nitric oxide. The liberated nitric oxide is sparingly soluble in water and returns to the gas in the chamber where it reacts with oxygen in the air to reform nitrogen dioxide. Some percentage of the nitrogen oxides are sequestered in the reaction liquor as nitrosylsulfuric acid and as nitric acid, so fresh nitric oxide must be added as the process proceeds. Later versions of chamber plants included a high-temperature Glover tower to recover the nitrogen oxides from the chamber liquor, while concentrating the chamber acid to as much as 78% H2SO4. Exhaust gases from the chambers are scrubbed by passing into a tower through which some of the Glover acid flows over broken tile. Nitrogen oxides are absorbed to form nitrosylsulfuric acid, which is then returned to the Glover tower to reclaim the oxides of nitrogen.\n\nSulfuric acid produced in the reaction chambers is limited to about 35% concentration.  At higher concentrations, nitrosylsulfuric acid precipitates on the lead walls as chamber crystals and is no longer able to catalyze the oxidation reactions. \n\nChemistry \n\nSulfur dioxide is generated by burning elemental sulfur or by roasting pyritic ore in a current of air:\n\nS8 + 8 O2 \u2192 8 SO2 \n4 FeS2 + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 8 SO2\n\nNitrogen oxides are produced by decomposition of niter in the presence of sulfuric acid or hydrolysis of nitrosylsulfuric acid:\n\n2 NaNO3 + H2SO4 \u2192 Na2SO4 + H2O + NO + NO2 + O2\n2 NOHSO4 + H2O \u2192  2 H2SO4 + NO + NO2\n\nIn the reaction chambers, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve in the reaction liquor.  Nitrogen dioxide is hydrated to produce nitrous acid which then oxidizes the sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid and nitric oxide.  The reactions are not well characterized but it is known that nitrosylsulfuric acid is an intermediate in at least one pathway. The major overall reactions are:\n\n2 NO2 + H2O \u2192 HNO2 + HNO3\nSO2 (aq) + HNO3 \u2192 NOHSO4\nNOHSO4 + HNO2 \u2192  H2SO4 + NO2 + NO\nSO2 (aq) + 2 HNO2 \u2192 H2SO4 + 2 NO\n\nNitric oxide escapes from the reaction liquor and is subsequently reoxidized by molecular oxygen to nitrogen dioxide.  This is the overall rate determining step in the process: \n\n2 NO + O2 \u2192 2 NO2\n\nNitrogen oxides are absorbed and regenerated in the process, and thus serve as a catalyst for the overall reaction:\n\n2 SO2 + 2 H2O + O2 \u2192 2 H2SO4\nQuestion:\nWhich acid used to be made by the lead chamber process but is now usually made by the contact process?\nAnswer:\nSulpher\nPassage:\nChris Andrews (singer)\nChristopher Frederick \"Chris\" Andrews (born 15 October 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, whose musical career started in the late 1950s.   \n\nCareer\n\nAndrews was born in Romford, Essex, England, and by his mid teens had formed his own group, Chris Ravel and the Ravers,  and was playing at Soho venues which included the 2i's Coffee Bar and Flamingo Nightclub. On 14 March 1959, he made his British television debut, performing on the Oh, Boy! show. He would later return in April to perform a cover of Cliff Richard's, \"Move It\".\n\nFor Adam Faith, Andrews wrote \"The First Time\" (No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, 1963)  and \"We Are in Love\" (No. 11, 1964), and then a string of hits for Sandie Shaw. They included \"Girl Don't Come\" (No. 3, 1964/65), \"I'll Stop at Nothing\" (No. 4, 1965), \"Message Understood\" (No. 6, 1965) and \"Long Live Love\" (No. 1, 1965). The latter remained a chart topper in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks.  \"Girl Don't Come\" was covered by Cher on her debut album, All I Really Want to Do. \n\nAlso in 1965, Andrews as a solo artist, got to No. 3 in the same listings with \"Yesterday Man\",  which peaked in Germany at No. 1 for four weeks;  followed up with a No. 13 hit in the UK \"To Whom It Concerns\".  The instrumental section of this song was used as the theme for RT\u00c9's long-running TV programme, The Late Late Show, until 1999, and a re-arranged version returned as the show's theme music in September 2009. As well as obtaining a high placing in the UK chart with \"Yesterday Man\", it also climbed to No. 1 in Ireland and Germany. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.  Later releases were not as successful, but his own hits are seen as early examples of reggae influenced white pop music. Although his chart appearances dwindled in Britain by 1966, his chart topping success continued in mainland Europe for a number of years, particularly in Germany, and Andrews often recorded in foreign languages.\n\nIn South Africa, his later single releases proved particularly popular,  with \"Pretty Belinda\" (1969), \"Carol OK\" and \"Brown Eyes\" (both 1970) all topping the charts there. \"Yo Yo\" reached No. 7 at the end of 1970.\n\nAndrews remains active in his career as a singer-songwriter, working primarily in continental Europe and in the United Kingdom. He lives with his second wife Alexandra, who is also his manager, in Germany and Spain.\n\nSongwriting credits\n\n*\"As Long as You're Happy Baby\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Come Closer\" \u2013 Adam Faith\n*\"Don't Run Away\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"First Time\" \u2013 Adam Faith\n*\"Girl Don't Come\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Heart of Stone\" \u2013 Suzi Quatro\n*\"Here's Another Day\" \u2013 Adam Faith\n*\"How Can You Tell\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"I'll Remember Tonight\" \u2013 The Mamas & the Papas\n*\"I'll Stop at Nothing\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Long Live Love\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Message Understood\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Nothing Comes Easy\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Nothing Less than Brilliant\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Run\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Show Me\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Think It All Over\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Think Sometimes About Me\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Today\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Tomorrow\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"We Are in Love\" \u2013 Adam Faith\n*\"You Don't Love Me\" \u2013 The Roulettes\n*\"You've Not Changed\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw \n\nDiscography\n\nSingles\nQuestion:\nChris Andrews got to no.3 in \u201965 with a title whose initials were YM.

Horne was showing signs of senility, and her daughter had a deformity of her hands and feet. The neighbours accused Horne of having used her daughter as a pony to ride to the Devil, where she had her shod by him. The trial was conducted very quickly; the sheriff had judged both guilty and sentenced them to be burned at the stake. The daughter managed to escape, but Janet was stripped, smeared with tar, paraded through the town on a barrel and burned alive. Nine years after her death the witchcraft acts were repealed in Scotland.\n\nJanet (or Jenny) Horne was also a generic name for witches in the north of Scotland at the time and this makes it difficult to determine what the real name of this woman may have been. Contemporary writers may have called her 'Janet Horne' simply because her real name was unknown or because the name was reported as 'Janet Horne' and they were unaware that this was a generic name. Some sources give the date of the Dornoch execution as June 1722. \n\nLegacy\n\nShe is the subject of the play The Last Witch by Rona Munro, which premiered at the 2009 Edinburgh International Festival. \n\nAlso, the events of the story are the subject of the song \"Am I Evil?\" by heavy metal band Diamond Head.\nQuestion:\nIn 1727, Janet Horne became the last British person to be executed for what crime?\nAnswer:\nBewitcher\nPassage:\nBlue Peter's theme tune - BBC\nBBC New Talent Under 16s - Blue Peter Music Makers - Theme Tunes\n\u00a0\nBlue Peter's theme tune\nBlue Peter Music Makers gave 40 young musicians the chance to get involved in recording a new version of the theme tune 'Barnacle Bill'.\nThe track    is one of the best known pieces of music on TV and has been used on the programme since the first ever episode in 1958. There have been lots of different versions of the tune but perhaps the most famous is Mike Oldfield's track from 1979, which was also released as a single.\nDemonstration from Mike Oldfield\nMike Oldfield is the man who inspired Murray Gold to become a composer.

Founded in the early 1970s by Stephen Marks, who remains chief executive, it is based in London and its parent French Connection Group PLC is listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nFrench Connection distributes its clothing and accessories through its own stores in the UK, US and Canada and through franchise and wholesale arrangements globally.  The company became notorious for the use of the \"fcuk\" initialism in its advertising campaigns in the early 2000s.\n\nOther brands currently within the group include Great Plains, Toast and YMC. Former brands include Nicole Farhi.\n\nBrand history\n\nStephen Marks, who started out in business in 1969 as the Stephen Marks brand, established French Connection in 1972 \u2013 a year after the film of the same name was released. Initially designed as a mid-market women's brand, he has said the name came about because he managed to acquire a large shipment of Indian cheesecloth shirts \u2013 via a French contact \u2013 that could be resold in the UK at a large profit. The business expanded into menswear in 1976. \n\nIn 1978, Nicole Farhi joined French Connection as a designer. In 1983, her eponymous higher-end label was launched by the French Connection parent group and this was not sold until 2010. \n\nAfter Marks floated the French Connection brand on the London Stock Exchange in 1984, he was listed as the 15th richest man in Britain, but by the late 1980s the company was in trouble.  He took control of the direction of French Connection again in 1991.\n\nFCUK branding controversy\n\nFrench Connection began using the branding \"fcuk\" (usually written in lowercase, and deliberately similar to the taboo-word \"fuck\") in advertising  after 1991 when Marks regained control.  Reportedly, the first use of the initialism was on faxes sent between Hong Kong and London offices, headed \"FCHK to FCUK\".  Marks said in a subsequent interview that the faxes were not intended to be rude. The advertising campaign came about after he was so impressed by a bra advert featuring Eva Herzigov\u00e1 that he contacted the advertising executive behind it, Trevor Beattie, even though the company did not have a budget for an advertising campaign at the time. It was Beattie who spotted the marketing potential of the initialism and a campaign was launched around it. \n\nUse of this term caused widespread controversy due to its similarity to \"fuck\".  \n\nThe success of the branding in raising French Connection's profile led to similar tactics from other organisations. French Connection launched a trademark infringement case in the London High Court challenging the owner of \"First Consultants UK Ltd\", a computer company, over its use of the \"fcuk\" initialism. The case found that the Internet Domain fcuk.com was registered prior to French Connection applying for the UK Trademark and its claim for passing off was dismissed. Mr Justice Rattee refused to grant an injunction, describing French Connection's use of the initialism as \"a tasteless and obnoxious campaign.\"   The company threatened legal action against the political youth organisation Conservative Future, which had briefly adopted the spoof abbreviation \"cfuk\" (short for \"Conservative Future UK\"). \n\nFollowing a number of complaints about advertising campaigns using the initialism, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority requested that the company submit all poster campaigns for approval before running them. In the United States, the American Family Association urged a boycott of fcuk products.  French Connection stopped using the initialism in advertising in 2005, and reduced its profile in its shops.  However it is still used on certain menswear products and in-store branding.  Despite this lowering of the profile, French Connection remains known as \"fcuk\", particularly by the UK press.  In 2016 it was reported that French Connection was to bring back its FCUK slogan campaign. \n\nBrand position\n\nWhile the revival of the UK brand's fortunes in the 1990s has been attributed to the success of the FCUK logo, it has had mixed financial fortunes during the 2000s, reflected in its poor share prices in the UK.  After reportedly losing market share to rivals such as Zara, Topshop and ASOS \u2013 with some analysts suggesting its pricing was out of step with other competitor brands \u2013 its position improved in 2014.  the French Connection brand had 131 stores in the UK and Europe. \n\nWorldwide operation\n\nFrench Connection distributes its branded womenswear and menswear through a network of owned stores, through franchised stores in major markets around the world, through concessions in department stores in the UK and also through other multi-brand retailers. French Connection also has a variety of licensed products,including eyeglasses, sunglasses, toiletries, shoes, jewellery and watches, which are sold through its own stores and specialist retailers, such as Boots and Specsavers. \n\nOther brands in group\n\nFrench Connection represents the majority of French Connection Group's revenue (some 88 per cent in 2014), however it owns a number of other clothing/homewear brands, including YMC, Great Plains and TOAST.  Toast now has eleven UK stores. \n\nPerfumes\n\nFrench Connection has produced perfumes as an extension to the main clothing brand. This is a partial list \n* Eau de Fcuk No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 \u2013 men's range introduced 2000 and women's perfumes in 2001.\n* Fcuk Her and Fcuk Him (2003) \u2013 Original women's perfume by Zirh/Shiseido and men's perfume by James Krivda.\n* Fcuk Connect Her and Fcuk Connect Him (2007) \u2013 Men's and women's ranges with base notes including musk. \n* Fcuk Friction Her and Friction Him (2012) \u2013 Women's perfume includes notes of coconut and vanilla, men's includes citrus.\nQuestion:\nIn the fashion label FCUK, for what does the FC stand?\nAnswer:\nFrench Connection\nPassage:\nFrangipane\nFrangipane is a filling made from or flavored with almonds. Frangipane/frangipani is derived from frangere il pane (Italian for \"that breaks the bread\"). This filling can be used in a variety of ways  including cakes and such pastries as the Bakewell tart, Conversation tart, Jesuite and Pithivier. A French spelling from a 1674 cookbook is franchipane with the earliest modern spelling coming from a 1732 confectioners' dictionary. Originally designated as a custard tart flavored by almonds or pistachios it came later to designate a filling that could be used in a variety of confections and baked goods. Frangipane is one of France's many traditional foods associated with Christmas celebration. \n\nToday it is normally made of butter, sugar, eggs, and ground almonds.\n\nIn some anecdotes it was the kind of sweet that the noblewoman Jacopa da Settesoli brought to St. Francis of Assisi in 1226, when he was dying.\n\nOn Epiphany, the French cut the King Cake, a round cake made of frangipane layers into slices to be distributed by a child known as le petit roi (the little king) who is usually hiding under the dining table.  The cake is decorated with stars, a crown, flowers and a special bean hidden inside the cake.  Whoever gets the piece of the frangipane cake with the bean is crowned \u201cking\u201d or \u201cqueen\u201d for the following year.\n\nEtymology\n\nFrangipane/frangipani derived from frangere il pane from which the noble Frangipani family of Rome derived its name in the 11th century. A certain Frangipane was perfumier to Louis XIII of France, hence the common name of the flowering tropical trees that are actually in the genus Plumeria. Other people believe it's derived from St. Francis; pane is Italian for bread and Frangi would have been the cognomen of St. Francis.\n\nOther uses\n\nFrangipane can also refer to:\n* A Belgian almond pastry tart.\n*: Usually the individual cakes have a striped pattern on top,  occasionally with icing (resembling a hot cross bun from above).\n* The frangipane (frangipani, Plumeria) tree as in John Vanderslice's song Kookaburra\nQuestion:\nWhat traditionally provides the flavour/flavor in a frangipane cake filling?\nAnswer:\nAlmond tree\nPassage:\nMillion Dollar Mermaid\nMillion Dollar Mermaid (also known as The One Piece Bathing Suit in the UK) is a 1952 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer biographical musical film of the life of Australian swimming star Annette Kellerman. It was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. from a screenplay by Everett Freeman. The music score was by Adolph Deutsch, the cinematography by George J. Folsey and the choreography by Busby Berkeley. \n\nGeorge J. Folsey received a 1953 Oscar nomination for  Best Cinematography, Color. \n\nThe film stars Esther Williams, Victor Mature, and Walter Pidgeon, with David Brian and Donna Corcoran.\n\nPlot\n\nIn the late 19th Century, a polio-stricken Australian girl, Annette Kellerman (Esther Williams), swims as a means to improve her health. Her father, Frederick (Walter Pidgeon), who owns a music conservatory, accepts a teaching position in England.\n\nAboard ship, Annette encounters the American promoter James Sullivan (Victor Mature) and his associate Doc Cronnol (Jesse White), who are taking a boxing kangaroo called Sydney with them to London.\n\nThe teaching position falls through and Jimmy suggests promoting Annette in a six-mile swim to Greenwich. She volunteers to make it 26 miles instead. Word spreads of the swim and Annette's feat makes news.\n\nJimmy suggests they can make a fortune by going to New York and appearing in a water ballet at the Hippodrome.   Manager Alfred Harper (David Brian) does not offer them a job in the show, so Annette goes to Boston for a highly publicized swim and gets in hot water for wearing a one-piece suit too revealing for its time.\n\nShe and Jimmy have a misunderstanding and part ways. Harper has a change of heart and makes Annette headliner of his New York show. After the death of her father, she travels to Montauk at the behest of Doc to try to dissuade Jimmy from flying in an air race with a $50,000 prize. It does not go well.\n\nAs time passes, Harper falls in love with Annette while she travels to Hollywood to make a film. Jimmy and Doc turn up, this time promoting a dog called Rin Tin Tin that they hope to star in the movies.\n\nA water tank bursts during the making of Annette's film, causing her serious injury, Spinal Hematoma.

Coming out of the long-standing medieval tradition of piquant spicy fruit sauces rendered sharply sour with verjuice or vinegar and served with meat, but created sometime in the 19th century,  the sauce appears in various editions of Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. It was named for the Duke of Cumberland, who had ties to Hanover, Germany, where the sauce was invented, according to Alexis Soyer's recipe in The Gastronomic Regenerator  (1846) for a port-wine based sauce accompanying boar\u2019s head, which Janet Clarkson notes \"contains what we think of as the required citrus note in the form of Seville orange rind (along with mustard).\" \nIt is a more complex version of a simple redcurrant sauce\n\nDespite its German origin, today the sauce is ubiquitous in the Cumbria region of England and is thought of as a thoroughly British condiment.\n\nAlthough variations exist, common ingredients include red currants or cowberries, port or claret, dry mustard, pepper, orange, ginger, red currant jelly and vinegar.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the key ingredient of 'Cumberland Sauce'?\nAnswer:\nREDCURRANTS\n\n\nPassage:\nBall game\nBall games (or ballgames), also ball sports, are any form of game or sport which feature a ball as part of play.

In traditional timber framing there are three basic types of purlin: purlin plate, principal purlin and common purlin.\n\nPurlin plates in wooden construction\n\nA purlin plate in wooden construction is also called an \"arcade plate\" in European English,  \"under purlin\", and \"principal purlin\". The term plate means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. Purlin plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and are supported by posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. Purlin plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America. A crown plate has similarities to a purlin plate but supports collar beams in the middle of a timber framed building.\n\nPrincipal purlins in wood construction\n\nPrincipal purlins in wood construction, also called \"major purlin\", \"side purlin\". Principal purlins are supported by principal rafters and support common rafters in what is known as a \"double roof\" (a roof framed with a layer of principal rafters and a layer of common rafters). Principal purlins are further classified by how they connect to the principal rafters:  \"Through purlins\" pass over the top; \"butt purlins\" tenon into the sides of the principal rafters; \"clasped purlins,\" of which only one historic U.S. example is known,) are captured by a collar beam. Through purlins are further categorized as trenched, back, or clasped; butt purlins are classified as threaded, tenoned, and/or staggered. \n\nCommon purlins in wood construction\n\nCommon purlins in wood construction, also called a \"major-rafter minor-purlin system\".  Common purlins are typically \"trenched through\" the top sides (backs) of principal rafters and carry vertical roof sheathing (The key to identifying this type of roof system). Common purlin roofs in North America are found in areas settled by Englishmen and may have been a new invention in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. No examples of framed buildings with common purlin roofs have been reported in England, however some stone barns in England have vertically boarded, common purlin roofs. Historically, these roofs are found in New England, the highest concentration in Maine, and isolated parts of New York and along the St. Lawrence River in Canada. One of the oldest extant (surviving) examples is in the Coffin House in Newbury, Massachusetts from 1678. The purpose of a common purlin roof may be they allow a board roof, that is a roof of nothing but vertically laid boards with seams covered with battens or another layer of boards. \n\nSteel construction\n\nIn steel construction, the term purlin typically refers to roof framing members that span parallel to the building eave, and support the roof decking or sheeting.  The purlins are in turn supported by rafters or walls. Purlins are most commonly used in Metal Building Systems, where Z-shapes are utilized in a manner that allows flexural continuity between spans.\n\nIt is the practice in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: Channel sections, with or without flange stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; Channel sections without flange stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently cold-formed steel C, Z or U sections, (or mill rolled) C sections.\n\nCold formed members can be efficient on a weight basis relative to mill rolled sections for secondary member applications. Additionally, Z sections can be nested for transportation bundling and, on the building, lapped at the supports to develop a structurally efficient continuous beam across multiple supports.\n\nEtymology\n\nInformation on the origin of the term \"purlin\" is scant. The Oxford Dictionary suggests a French origin, with the earliest quote using a variation of purlin in 1447.\n\nGallery\n\nNote: The sketches in this section reference terminology commonly used in the UK and Australia.  \n\nFile:Rf-trad-section.gif| A section though lightweight timber frame construction showing the position of under purlins.\nImage:Metal-purlins.jpg|Roll formed metal roof purlins.

It follows the lives of a group of Royal Navy sailors fighting the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II.\nIt contains seven chapters, each describing a year during the war.\n\nThe novel, based on the author's experience of serving in corvettes in the North Atlantic in World War II, gives a matter-of-fact but moving portrayal of ordinary men learning to fight and survive in a violent, exhausting battle against the elements and a ruthless enemy.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe action commences in 1939. Lieutenant-Commander George Ericson, a Merchant Navy and Royal Naval Reserve officer, is recalled to the Royal Navy and given command of the fictitious Flower-class corvette HMS Compass Rose, newly built to escort convoys. His officers are mostly new to the Navy, especially the two new sub-lieutenants, Lockhart and Ferraby. Only Ericson and the petty officers are in any way experienced.\n\nDespite these initial disadvantages, the ship and crew work up a routine and gain experience. Bennett, the first lieutenant, a mean and shirking disciplinarian with a penchant for bullying and canned sausages (snorkers), leaves the ship ostensibly for health reasons, and the junior officers are able to mature, with Lockhart gaining promotion to first lieutenant.\n\nThe crew cross the Atlantic many times on escort duty in all kinds of weather, often encountering fierce storms in one of the smallest ships to provide escort services to the Allied convoys. The men endure the ship's constant rolling and pitching in the huge waves, freezing cold, the strain of maintaining station on the convoy on pitch-black nights and the fear that at any second a torpedo from a German U-boat could blow them to oblivion. Somehow the tradition of the Royal Navy and the knowledge of the importance of their work carries them through.\n\nThey continue the monotonous and dangerous but vital duty of convoy escort and after one particularly difficult convoy they use all their hard won knowledge to sink a German submarine. \nThey are nearly sunk several times until in 1943 they are finally torpedoed and forced to abandon ship. Most of the crew die in the freezing waters, but Ericson, Lockhart, Ferraby, and a few others are rescued the next day, but Ferraby suffers a break down forcing him to go to hospital.\n\nEricson, now promoted to commander, and Lockhart, now a lieutenant-commander, take command of a new ship, the fictitious River class frigate HMS Saltash. (In the film adaptation, the ship is called Saltash Castle and is portrayed by the Castle class corvette HMS Portchester Castle, as no River class vessels were available.)\n\nThe Royal Navy is now finally gaining the upper hand over the U-boats and Saltash adds to the growing number of kills due to Ericson's determination and patience.\n\nIn chapter seven the ship receives a message ordering it to \"remain on patrol in vicinity of Rockall\" as the end of the Second World War approaches in 1945, a well-known quote.\n\nWhen the war ends, the ship returns to port as a guard to several German submarines that have surrendered.\n\nA secondary plotline concerns Lockhart's poignant romance with a beautiful Women's Royal Naval Service officer.\n\nOrigins\n\nNicholas Monsarrat's own career was the model for that of his character Lockhart, a Fleet Street reporter in the 1930s, commissioned as a naval reservist.  Monsarrat spent the war in anti-submarine escort ships, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Commander.  His first book, Three Corvettes was published in 1945.  After the war he was a publicity officer at British missions overseas (notably Ottawa) before becoming a full-time writer.\n\nFilm and radio adaptations\n\nThe novel was  made into the film The Cruel Sea in 1953, directed by Charles Frend and starring Jack Hawkins as Commander Ericson and Donald Sinden as Lockhart.\n\nBBC Radio 4 has produced two radio adaptations of the book. In September 1980, a two-hour  dramatised version starred Richard Pasco as Ericson and Michael N. Harbour as Lockhart, and with Terry Molloy as the Coxswain of Saltash. Recording took place with the assistance of the captain and ship's company of HMS Brighton and the captain of HMS Scylla. The narrator was Martin Muncaster. In March 2012, another two hour version, starred Gwilym Lee as Lockhart and Jonathan Coy as Ericson. Dramatised by John Fletcher and directed by Marc Beeby, this adaptation went on to win 'Best Use of Sound in an Audio Drama' in the BBC Audio Drama Awards 2013.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the WW11 novel 'The Cruel Sea'?\nAnswer:\nNicholas Monsarrat\nPassage:\nThree Times a Lady\n\"Three Times a Lady\" is a song by American soul group the Commodores, from their 1978 album Natural High. It was produced by James Anthony Carmichael and the Commodores. It was also the only Motown song to reach the Top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 that year and the Commodores's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit, topping the chart for two weeks on August 12, 1978 and also went to number one the soul chart for two weeks.   The song spent three weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart. \n\nThe song also reached #1 on the Canadian RPM Singles Chart for four weeks, and was one of only a few Motown singles to reach the top spot in the UK Singles Chart, staying there for five weeks.  The song was also successful in Ireland, staying at #1 in the charts for three consecutive weeks. It was #1 in Australia for five weeks, and reached #2 in New Zealand.\n\nThe original Commodores' version of the song was included as the final track on Lionel Richie's greatest hits compilation album Back To Front, released in 1992.\n\nIn an appearance on The Early Show on June 12, 2009, Lionel Richie said he was inspired to write the song because of a comment his father made about his mother. His father said to his mother \"I love you. I want you. I need you. Forever\" hence the three times a lady. \n\nCovers\n\n* Nate Harvell recorded one of the first country versions in 1978, reaching #23 on the Billboard country chart.\n* The song was also covered in the country genre by country singer Billy \"Crash\" Craddock on his 1986 album Crash Craddock and in 2007 by Cobra Starship as an iTunes bonus track for their album \u00a1Viva La Cobra!. In 2001 it was covered by Anglo-Norwegian boy band a1 and featured on Motown Mania and as a bonus track on their hit single \"No More\".\n* The Shadows did an instrumental of the song on Moonlight Shadows (1986).\n* Kenny Rogers covered the song on After Dark.  It was also featured on his hits compilation All The Hits And All New Love Songs.  Rogers performed the song on the Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters television show on November 29, 1980.\n* The most successful cover version was performed by Conway Twitty, whose version appears on his 1983 album Lost in the Feeling. Twitty's version reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in the late winter of 1984.  Allmusic reviewer Tom Jurek wrote that \"Three Times a Lady\" and the previous single, \"Heartache Tonight\" \"offer(ed) a solid view of Twitty's amazing crossover potential, and his ability to take well-known pop tracks and turn them into solid country smashes long after the countrypolitan days of Chet Atkins and RCA.\"  (In addition to \"Heartache Tonight\" (a cover of a song by The Eagles), Twitty had successfully covered \"Slow Hand\" and \"The Rose,\" previously pop hits for the Pointer Sisters and Bette Midler, respectively.)\nQuestion:\nWhat group had their first UK hit with three times a lady ?\nAnswer:\nWalter Orange\nPassage:\nConcertgebouw\nThe Royal Concertgebouw (,) is a concert hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The Dutch term \"concertgebouw\" literally translates into English as \"concert building\". On 11 April 2013, on occasion of the building's 125th anniversary, Queen Beatrix bestowed the Royal Title \"Koninklijk\" upon the building, as she did previously (in 1988) to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.  Because of its highly regarded acoustics, the Concertgebouw is considered one of the finest concert halls in the world, along with places such as Boston's Symphony Hall   and the Musikverein in Vienna.\n\nHistory\n\nThe architect of the building was Adolf Leonard van Gendt, who was inspired by the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, built two years earlier (and destroyed in 1943).\n\nConstruction began in 1883 in a pasture that was then outside the city, in Nieuwer-Amstel, a municipality that in 1964 became Amstelveen.  A total of 2,186 piles of length twelve to thirteen metres (40 to 43\u00a0ft) were sunk into the soil.\n\nThe hall opened on 11 April 1888 with an inaugural concert, in which an orchestra of 120 musicians and a chorus of 500 singers participated, performing works of Wagner, Handel, Bach, and Beethoven. The resident orchestra of the Concertgebouw is the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest), which gave its first concert in the hall on 3 November 1888, as the Concertgebouw Orchestra (Concertgebouworkest). For many decades the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra and the Radio Filharmonisch Orkest have also been regular performers in the Concertgebouw.\n\nThe Main Hall (Grote Zaal) seats 1,974, and is 44 metres (144\u00a0ft) long, 28 metres (92\u00a0ft) wide, and 17 metres (56\u00a0ft) high.  Its reverberation time is 2.8 seconds without audience, 2.2 seconds with, making it ideal for the late Romantic repertoire such as Mahler. Though this characteristic makes it largely unsuited for amplified music, groups such as Led Zeppelin, The Who and Pink Floyd performed there in the 1960s. It hosts not only orchestral and operatic performances, but also jazz and world music.\n\nA smaller, oval-shaped venue, the Recital Hall (Kleine Zaal), is located behind the Main Hall. The Recital Hall is 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) long and 15 metres (50\u00a0ft) wide. Its more intimate space is well-suited for chamber music and Lieder. The Recital Hall has 437 seats.\n\nWhen the Concertgebouw was built, acoustics were something of a black art. As in shipbuilding, designers drew upon what had worked in the past without entirely understanding the underlying science. When the building was completed, the acoustics were not perfect, and a lot of effort went into fine-tuning the aural ambience. During later restorations, particular care has been taken not to alter the materials used for interior decoration with this in mind. In the 1980s, the hall embarked on extensive fund-raising for renovations after the hall was found to be slowly sinking into the ground. Pi de Bruijn was the architect for the contemporary annex to the original hall. \n\nToday, some nine hundred concerts and other events per year take place in the Concertgebouw, for a public of over 700,000, making it one of the most-visited concert halls in the world. \n\n, the managing director of the Concertgebouw is Simon Reinink and the artistic director is Anneke Hogenstijn. \n\nOrgan \n\nThe organ was built in 1890 by the organ builder Michael Maarschalkerweerd from Utrecht, and was renovated in the years 1990-1993 by the organ builder Flentrop. It has 60 registers on three divisions and pedal. \n\n* Couplers: II/I (also as Suboktavkoppel), III/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P\n\nNames of composers in the Main Hall\n\nIn the Main Hall, the surnames of the following 46 composers are displayed on the balcony ledges and on the walls: \n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe Concertgebouw is mentioned, along with Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl, and the Rainbow Theatre, in the song \"Rock Show\" from the 1975 Wings album Venus and Mars.\n\nKris Debruyne, a Belgian singer, mentions the Concertgebouw in his song \"Amsterdam\".\n\nGallery\n\nFile:A.L. van Gendt Concertgebouw 0.jpg|Architectural drawings of the design, dated 1888.\nImage:Jacob Olie - Concertgebouw Amsterdam 10 november 1902.jpeg|The Concertgebouw in 1902.\nImage:Concert18.jpg|The Main Hall (Grote Zaal) of the Concertgebouw.\nImage:ConcertgebouwMuseumpleinAmsterdam.jpg|The Concertgebouw at night, 2008.\nImage:Concertgebouw-july2010.jpg|A piano quintet concert in the Main Hall, July 2010.\nQuestion:\nThe home of The Royal Concertgebouw is in which city?\nAnswer:\nClassis of Amsterdam\nPassage:\nJosephine Wayne\nJosephine S.

The couple married on June 24, 1933, in a garden ceremony at actress Loretta Young's home. \n\nThe couple had four children: Michael Wayne (film producer, November 23, 1934 \u2013 April 2, 2003), Mary Antonia \"Toni\" Morrison-LaCava (February 25, 1936 \u2013  December 6, 2000), Patrick Wayne (born July 15, 1939) and Melinda Morrison-Mu\u00f1oz (born December 3, 1940).\n\nAfter a few years, the marriage was in trouble. Wayne worked long hours at his career and was always surrounded by associates from the film world. The couple also had differences of opinion about how their children should be raised.  In 1943 they separated and eventually divorced in 1945.  She also found great happiness in 1996 when she married Cyril Nigg (died March, 1999 ), a well known Los Angeles businessman, who shared her love of service to the community.\n\nDeath\n\nJosephine Saenz died in 2003, at age 95, from cancer, having been predeceased by two of her children, Michael and Toni.\nQuestion:\nWhich very famous actor had three wives, Josephine Alicia Saenz, Esperanza Baur and Pilar Pallete?\nAnswer:\nMichael Morris (John Wayne)\nPassage:\npangram:\nPangram\npangram:\nPangram (  p\u00e6ngr\u00e6m )  [f.

They are used to spear, hook, move or otherwise act on other objects.  They may be made of metal, wood, bone or other hard, strong material.\n\nThe number of tines (also written tynes) on tools varies widely \u2013 a pitchfork may have just two, a garden fork may have four, and a rake or harrow many.  Tines may be blunt, such as those on a fork used as an eating utensil; or sharp, as on a pitchfork; or even barbed, as on a trident. The terms \"tine\" and \"prong\" are mostly interchangeable. A tooth of a comb is a tine.\n\nTines and prongs occur in nature\u2014for example, forming the branched bony antlers of deer or the forked horns of pronghorn antelopes. The term \"tine\" is also used for mountains, such as the fictional Silvertine in The Lord of the Rings.\n\nIn chaos theory (physics, non-linear dynamics), the branches of a bifurcation diagram are called tines and subtines.\nQuestion:\nWhat is a prong of a fork called\nAnswer:\nTine\nPassage:\nList of association football teams to have won four or more trophies in one season\nIn a football season, clubs typically compete in a number of different competitions: usually a domestic league and at least one cup competition, as well as sometimes competing in continental football, that is, the tournaments organised by one of FIFA's six confederations. Winning multiple competitions is seen as a particularly momentous achievement. \n\nDoubles and trebles are usually long-remembered achievements, but do occur with some level of frequency.  By contrast, winning four or more trophies in one season is exceptionally rare. In recent years, the terms quadruple, quintuple and sextuple have come to be occasionally used to refer to winning four, five or six top-tier trophies in a single season.     \n\nThe list below considers only teams whose victories include trophies in the top tier of their league system.\n\nFour titles in one season\n\nSome clubs have won four competitions in a single season. This has sometimes been called a 'quadruple'.\n\nOther teams have won four competitions in a calendar year, though not all in the same season.\n\nFive titles in one season\n\nOther teams have won five competitions in a calendar year, though not all in the same season. Liverpool achieved this in 2001, winning all competitions entered with the exception of the domestic league title;  Internazionale achieved this feat in 2010 (no UEFA Super Cup), Spanish club F.C. Barcelona achieved this in 2011 (all but 2010\u201311 Copa del Rey) and 2015 (all but 2015 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a);  Germany's FC Bayern Munich won five trophies in 2013 (everything but the DFL-Supercup). \n\nSix titles in a season\n\nBarcelona won six titles in 2009 (Copa del Rey, La Liga, UEFA Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup)  has been described as a 'sextuple'; however, this achievement took place over the course of two different Spanish seasons, winning a treble in the 2008\u201309 season.   It is counted together by many as the three added trophies were extra matches of the treble won, played in the same calendar year.\n\nSeven titles in a season\nQuestion:\nWhich football club was the first to win the sextuple of all possible major competitions?\nAnswer:\nThe weather in Barcelona\nPassage:\nYou (S Club 7 song)\n\"You\" was the 9th single released by UK pop group S Club 7 on 11 February 2002.

The video was set in the 1950s and is described in the Best CD booklet as the \"candyfloss-bright, tongue-in-cheek 50s pastiche\". This track was the last single to feature departed band member Paul Cattermole and sparked the last leg of the S Club 7 journey. The song reached no. 2 on the UK Singles Chart.

Hole is a brilliant and driven detective with unorthodox methods, a classic loose cannon in the police force.\n\nCharacter\n\nHarry Hole, a police officer with the Oslo Crime Squad, lost his mother, a descendant of the Sami people, to cancer while he was in his twenties, and he has never had a close relationship to his father, Olav Hole, a former teacher. He was born in 1965, and has a younger sister with Down syndrome. He is unmarried, but has had close relationships with a number of women throughout the series of ten novels. Otherwise, he has few close friends \u2013 and the ability to make enemies from amongst his colleagues who, nevertheless, grudgingly respect him.\n\nHole is a heavy smoker and an alcoholic although, at times, his alcoholism is under control. The effects of his problem sometimes bring him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues, but Bjarne M\u00f8ller, head of Hole's department and one of his closest friends, manages to prevent him from being sacked as a result, primarily because he recognises that Harry Hole is a brilliant detective who is recognised amongst his colleagues because of his role in the solving the case of a serial killer in Australia. Hole is one of few in the force who has undergone special training in police interrogation techniques and firearms by the FBI.\n\nHole has few friends within the Oslo Police Department, exceptions being some staff at the forensics division of the Norwegian police, including Beate L\u00f8nn, whom he often uses to secure crucial information in critical situations where specialist knowledge is required, and Bj\u00f8rn Holm, another skilled forensics officer. Harry is also friendly with Gunnar Hagen, his former senior officer prior to the case chronicled in Phantom.\n\nIn many ways, the author's home city of Oslo has the starring role in the Harry Hole novels. Much of the background detail of the stories involves real locations, and the city is shown \"warts and all\", ranging from Hole's favourite eating and drinking places that he frequents, to the traffic of the so-called \"Traffic Machine\" road system, the real-life headquarters of the Police Department, the swimming pool at Frogner Park, to the haunts of neo-Nazis, drug addicts and prostitutes, all of this described vividly (in the various novels) at different times of the year \u2013 in the snow and freezing weather of winter to the high temperatures of a particularly warm summer. Harry Hole's friends and acquaintances include city residents from every social background, including immigrants from other parts of the world to old school friends such as \u00d8ystein Eikeland, the taxi driver \u2013 possibly the person with whom he is closest.\n\nHarry Hole's home address is in Sofies Gate in Bislett, Oslo. In Phantom he no longer lives here, as he has been in Hong Kong for three years. Near his place of residence is his favourite \"watering hole\", Restaurant Schr\u00f8der (Schr\u00f8der's, for short) in St. Hanshaugen, which figures in most of the novels. He has had a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke, whose son, Oleg, looks up to Harry as a father figure. After the case chronicled in The Snowman, their relationship is put under severe pressure.\n\n\"Hole\", Harry's family name, is the name of a historic Norwegian town (Hole, Norway), with a heritage that goes back to Norway's origins in the Viking Age. The name is derived from Old Norse H\u00f3lar, the plural form of h\u00f3ll, meaning \"round (and isolated) hill\". The word is pronounced as two syllables, with stress on the first (hoh-leh), as is implied in The Bat, where the Australian police call him \"Harry Holy\".\n\nAppearances in the Harry Hole series\n\n* In The Bat (1997), Hole is sent to Sydney, Australia to aid the Australian police in their investigation of the murder of a Norwegian citizen.\n* In Cockroaches (1998), Hole is sent to Thailand to investigate the murder of the Norwegian ambassador.\n* In The Redbreast (2000), Hole tracks an assassin planning an attack on a prominent member of the establishment.\n* In Nemesis (2002), Hole investigates a fatal bank robbery and becomes implicated in the apparent murder of an ex-girlfriend.\n* In The Devil's Star (2003), Hole investigates a series of serial killings and suspects a fellow policeman of criminal activity. \n* In The Redeemer (2005), Hole is on the trail of a Croatian hitman who kills a Salvation Army officer during a Christmas street concert.\n* In The Snowman (2007), Hole struggles to identify Norway's first serial killer.\n* In The Leopard (2009), Hole returns from self-imposed exile in Hong Kong and unofficially investigates a serial killer.\n* In Phantom (2011), Hole again returns from Hong Kong to look into a murder apparently committed by his would-be son, Oleg.

It is a deliberate weak link in a circuit which will 'blow' if an electrical appliance or extension lead draws too much current due to either an overload or a fault. The blown fuse cuts off the electricity to stop the lead and appliance from overheating and causing a fire.\nAppliances meeting the relevant product safety standards will always be fitted with a plug having a correctly-rated fuse. If you have to replace a fuse, it's essential, having checked and corrected the reason for the fuse blowing, to replace it only with another of the same rating.\nAs a rule of thumb, fuses are rated according to the power rating of the appliance. Plugs for appliances rated up to about 700 watts should have a 3 amp fuse (coloured red).\u00a0 Plugs for appliances rated between about 700 watts and 3000 watts (the maximum rating of a wall socket) should be fitted with a 13 amp fuse (coloured brown).

The company is the sixteenth largest brewer in the UK by market share, and the second largest brewer under family ownership after Shepherd Neame.\n\nHistory\n\nT&R Theakston Ltd. was founded in 1827 by Robert Theakston and John Wood at The Black Bull pub and brewhouse in Masham. By 1832 Theakston had sole ownership of the brewery and in 1875 he passed control over to his son Thomas who expanded the range of buildings by building the new brewery on the Paradise Fields.\n\nIn 1919 the company acquired and closed down the Lightfoot Brewery, also in Masham.\n\nTheakston's expanded into Cumbria in 1974 buying the Carlisle State Management Brewery.  The brewery had been owned and operated by the government since 1916.  However the site was a financial drain  on Theakston's and led to the company being taken over in 1984 by Blackburn based brewer, Matthew Brown plc.   Matthew Brown was itself taken over by Scottish & Newcastle in 1987.\n\nPaul Theakston (Managing Director since 1968) left Theakston's in 1988, and in 1992 established the Black Sheep Brewery in the old Lightfoot Brewery premises - located adjacent to the White Bear Hotel, one of Theakston's pubs.\n\nThe Carlisle brewery was closed in 1987, and brewing of some Theakston beers was transferred to Scottish & Newcastle's Tyne Brewery.\n\nIn 2004 the business returned to family ownership after being purchased back from Scottish & Newcastle by four Theakston brothers.  Major development works at the Masham Brewery enabled the company to announce that brewing of Theakston Bitter would return to Masham in 2009. \n\nBeers\n\nThe company produces cask ale and pasteurised bottled ales. Theakston cask ales are widely available in pubs in the north of England, though are less common in other parts of the country. The bottled beers are also widely distributed to British supermarkets and exported to Germany and the United States.\n\nThe company produces five regular cask ales and six seasonal. Only two of the beers are filtered and pasteurised to be made available in bottles, Theakston XB and Old Peculier.\n\nBest Bitter (3.8% ABV) is regularly paired with XB in pubs, Theakston Best Bitter is the company's most easily found product, served in many pubs, mainly in the north of England.\n\nXB (4.5% ABV) is a premium strength Bitter with a more complex flavour. It was launched in 1982.[http://www.barnsleycamra.org.uk/thebar/1992/april-1992.pdf \"Barnley's Bitter - Brewery News\"], Barnsleycamra.org.uk, April\u2013May 1992. Retrieved 28 November 2011\n\nBlack Bull Bitter (3.9% ABV) was brewed to commemorate the Theakson's first pub where the first Theakston's beers were brewed and sold.\n\nTraditional Mild (3.5% ABV) is the weakest beer produced by Theakston, a dark and dry drink created as an alternative for dark ales. It was launched in 1992.\n\nLightfoot Bitter (4.1%abv) originally brewed as a seasonal bitter but with its high popularity has become one of many regular Theakstons brew. Golden in colour and bitter in taste, a favourite in many s&n public houses.\n\nOld Peculier (5.6% ABV) is Theakston's most famous beer. Old Peculier has been made under this name since  the 1890s. In 2000, it won the silver medal in the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)'s \"Champion Winter Beer of Britain\" 2000 competition. The label on the bottle describes it as a \"full bodied, rich, smooth tasting ale with a mysterious and distinctive flavour\". It is named after the peculier of Masham, a peculier being a parish outside the jurisdiction of a diocese. In 1985 The Economist dubbed it the \"doyen of real ales.\" \n\nThe six seasonal ales are Cooper's Butt (4.3% ABV), Hogshead Bitter (4.1% ABV), Grouse Beater (4.2% ABV), Masham Ale (6.5% ABV) and Paradise Ale (4.2% ABV).\n\nVisitor Centre\n\nThe brewery also runs a small visitor centre at its home in Masham where guided tours are given about the actual working brewery. At the end of the tour, visitors are given tokens that can be exchanged for drinks at the bar of the Black Bull in Paradise, named after the original pub (Black Bull) and the location of the new brewery (Paradise Fields). There is also a small shop, selling crates of bottled XB and Old Peculier, beer glasses, T-shirts and an assortment of other souvenirs.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIn the All Creatures Great and Small episode \"Golden Lads & Girls\", James Herriot and Tristan Farnon are seen drinking a Theakston Nutty Brown Ale.\n\nIn The Shadow of Israphel there is a character named Old Peculier.\n\nIn Martha Grimes' Richard Jury novels, the character of Melrose Plant prefers Old Peculier.\nQuestion:\nWhich English brewery produces a beer called 'Old Peculiar'?\nAnswer:\nTheakstons\nPassage:\nI Whistle a Happy Tune\n\"I Whistle a Happy Tune\" is a show tune from the 1951 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, The King and I.

It is a portrait of Sue Tilley, then weighing about 127 kg,  a Job Centre supervisor. Tilley is the author of a biography of the Australian performer Leigh Bowery titled Leigh Bowery, The Life and Times of an Icon. Tilley was introduced to Freud by Bowery, who was already modelling for him. Freud painted a number of large portraits of her around the period 1994\u201396, and came to call her \"Big Sue\". He said of her body \"It's flesh without muscle and it has developed a different kind of texture through bearing such a weight-bearing thing\".  \n\nThe painting held the world record for the highest price paid for a painting by a living artist when it was sold by Guy Naggar  for US$33.6 million (\u00a317.2 million)  at Christie's in New York in May 2008 to Roman Abramovich.

It has been largely supplanted by the contact process.\n\nIn 1746 in Birmingham, England, John Roebuck began producing sulfuric acid in lead-lined chambers, which were stronger, were less expensive, and could be made much larger than the glass containers which had been used previously. This allowed the effective industrialization of sulfuric acid production and, with several refinements, this process remained the standard method of production for almost two centuries. So robust was the process that as late as 1946, the chamber process still accounted for 25% of sulfuric acid manufactured. \n\nProcess \n\nSulfur dioxide is introduced with steam and nitrogen oxide into large chambers lined with sheet lead where the gases are sprayed down with water and chamber acid. The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve and over a period of approximately 30 minutes the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfuric acid. The presence of nitrogen dioxide is necessary for the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate. The process is highly exothermic, and a major consideration of the design of the chambers was to provide a way to dissipate the heat formed in the reactions.\n\nEarly plants used very large lead-lined wooden rectangular chambers (Faulding box chambers) that were cooled by ambient air. The internal lead sheathing served to contain the corrosive sulfuric acid and to render the wooden chambers waterproof. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, such plants required about half a cubic meter of volume to process the sulfur dioxide equivalent of a kilogram of burned sulfur.  In the mid-19th century, French chemist Gay-Lussac redesigned the chambers as stoneware packed masonry cylinders. In the 20th century, plants using Mills-Packard chambers supplanted the earlier designs. These chambers were tall tapered cylinders that were externally cooled by water flowing down the outside surface of the chamber.\n\nSulfur dioxide for the process was provided by burning elemental sulfur or by the roasting of sulfur-containing metal ores in a stream of air in a furnace. During the early period of manufacture, nitrogen oxides were produced by the decomposition of niter at high temperature in the presence of acid, but this process was gradually supplanted by the air oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide in the presence of a catalyst.  The recovery and reuse of oxides of nitrogen was an important economic consideration in the operation of a chamber process plant.\n\nIn the reaction chambers, nitric oxide reacts with oxygen to produce nitrogen dioxide.  Liquid from the bottom of the chambers is diluted and pumped to the top of the chamber and sprayed downwards in a fine mist. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are absorbed in the liquid and react to form sulfuric acid and nitric oxide. The liberated nitric oxide is sparingly soluble in water and returns to the gas in the chamber where it reacts with oxygen in the air to reform nitrogen dioxide. Some percentage of the nitrogen oxides are sequestered in the reaction liquor as nitrosylsulfuric acid and as nitric acid, so fresh nitric oxide must be added as the process proceeds. Later versions of chamber plants included a high-temperature Glover tower to recover the nitrogen oxides from the chamber liquor, while concentrating the chamber acid to as much as 78% H2SO4. Exhaust gases from the chambers are scrubbed by passing into a tower through which some of the Glover acid flows over broken tile. Nitrogen oxides are absorbed to form nitrosylsulfuric acid, which is then returned to the Glover tower to reclaim the oxides of nitrogen.\n\nSulfuric acid produced in the reaction chambers is limited to about 35% concentration.  At higher concentrations, nitrosylsulfuric acid precipitates on the lead walls as chamber crystals and is no longer able to catalyze the oxidation reactions. \n\nChemistry \n\nSulfur dioxide is generated by burning elemental sulfur or by roasting pyritic ore in a current of air:\n\nS8 + 8 O2 \u2192 8 SO2 \n4 FeS2 + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 8 SO2\n\nNitrogen oxides are produced by decomposition of niter in the presence of sulfuric acid or hydrolysis of nitrosylsulfuric acid:\n\n2 NaNO3 + H2SO4 \u2192 Na2SO4 + H2O + NO + NO2 + O2\n2 NOHSO4 + H2O \u2192  2 H2SO4 + NO + NO2\n\nIn the reaction chambers, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve in the reaction liquor.  Nitrogen dioxide is hydrated to produce nitrous acid which then oxidizes the sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid and nitric oxide.  The reactions are not well characterized but it is known that nitrosylsulfuric acid is an intermediate in at least one pathway. The major overall reactions are:\n\n2 NO2 + H2O \u2192 HNO2 + HNO3\nSO2 (aq) + HNO3 \u2192 NOHSO4\nNOHSO4 + HNO2 \u2192  H2SO4 + NO2 + NO\nSO2 (aq) + 2 HNO2 \u2192 H2SO4 + 2 NO\n\nNitric oxide escapes from the reaction liquor and is subsequently reoxidized by molecular oxygen to nitrogen dioxide.  This is the overall rate determining step in the process: \n\n2 NO + O2 \u2192 2 NO2\n\nNitrogen oxides are absorbed and regenerated in the process, and thus serve as a catalyst for the overall reaction:\n\n2 SO2 + 2 H2O + O2 \u2192 2 H2SO4\nQuestion:\nWhich acid used to be made by the lead chamber process but is now usually made by the contact process?\nAnswer:\nSulpher\nPassage:\nChris Andrews (singer)\nChristopher Frederick \"Chris\" Andrews (born 15 October 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, whose musical career started in the late 1950s.   \n\nCareer\n\nAndrews was born in Romford, Essex, England, and by his mid teens had formed his own group, Chris Ravel and the Ravers,  and was playing at Soho venues which included the 2i's Coffee Bar and Flamingo Nightclub. On 14 March 1959, he made his British television debut, performing on the Oh, Boy! show. He would later return in April to perform a cover of Cliff Richard's, \"Move It\".\n\nFor Adam Faith, Andrews wrote \"The First Time\" (No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, 1963)  and \"We Are in Love\" (No. 11, 1964), and then a string of hits for Sandie Shaw. They included \"Girl Don't Come\" (No. 3, 1964/65), \"I'll Stop at Nothing\" (No. 4, 1965), \"Message Understood\" (No. 6, 1965) and \"Long Live Love\" (No. 1, 1965). The latter remained a chart topper in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks.  \"Girl Don't Come\" was covered by Cher on her debut album, All I Really Want to Do. \n\nAlso in 1965, Andrews as a solo artist, got to No. 3 in the same listings with \"Yesterday Man\",  which peaked in Germany at No. 1 for four weeks;  followed up with a No. 13 hit in the UK \"To Whom It Concerns\".  The instrumental section of this song was used as the theme for RT\u00c9's long-running TV programme, The Late Late Show, until 1999, and a re-arranged version returned as the show's theme music in September 2009. As well as obtaining a high placing in the UK chart with \"Yesterday Man\", it also climbed to No. 1 in Ireland and Germany. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.  Later releases were not as successful, but his own hits are seen as early examples of reggae influenced white pop music. Although his chart appearances dwindled in Britain by 1966, his chart topping success continued in mainland Europe for a number of years, particularly in Germany, and Andrews often recorded in foreign languages.\n\nIn South Africa, his later single releases proved particularly popular,  with \"Pretty Belinda\" (1969), \"Carol OK\" and \"Brown Eyes\" (both 1970) all topping the charts there. \"Yo Yo\" reached No. 7 at the end of 1970.\n\nAndrews remains active in his career as a singer-songwriter, working primarily in continental Europe and in the United Kingdom. He lives with his second wife Alexandra, who is also his manager, in Germany and Spain.\n\nSongwriting credits\n\n*\"As Long as You're Happy Baby\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Come Closer\" \u2013 Adam Faith\n*\"Don't Run Away\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"First Time\" \u2013 Adam Faith\n*\"Girl Don't Come\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Heart of Stone\" \u2013 Suzi Quatro\n*\"Here's Another Day\" \u2013 Adam Faith\n*\"How Can You Tell\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"I'll Remember Tonight\" \u2013 The Mamas & the Papas\n*\"I'll Stop at Nothing\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Long Live Love\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Message Understood\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Nothing Comes Easy\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Nothing Less than Brilliant\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Run\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Show Me\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Think It All Over\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Think Sometimes About Me\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Today\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"Tomorrow\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw\n*\"We Are in Love\" \u2013 Adam Faith\n*\"You Don't Love Me\" \u2013 The Roulettes\n*\"You've Not Changed\" \u2013 Sandie Shaw \n\nDiscography\n\nSingles\nQuestion:\nChris Andrews got to no.3 in \u201965 with a title whose initials were YM.

Horne was showing signs of senility, and her daughter had a deformity of her hands and feet. The neighbours accused Horne of having used her daughter as a pony to ride to the Devil, where she had her shod by him. The trial was conducted very quickly; the sheriff had judged both guilty and sentenced them to be burned at the stake. The daughter managed to escape, but Janet was stripped, smeared with tar, paraded through the town on a barrel and burned alive. Nine years after her death the witchcraft acts were repealed in Scotland.\n\nJanet (or Jenny) Horne was also a generic name for witches in the north of Scotland at the time and this makes it difficult to determine what the real name of this woman may have been. Contemporary writers may have called her 'Janet Horne' simply because her real name was unknown or because the name was reported as 'Janet Horne' and they were unaware that this was a generic name. Some sources give the date of the Dornoch execution as June 1722. \n\nLegacy\n\nShe is the subject of the play The Last Witch by Rona Munro, which premiered at the 2009 Edinburgh International Festival. \n\nAlso, the events of the story are the subject of the song \"Am I Evil?\" by heavy metal band Diamond Head.\nQuestion:\nIn 1727, Janet Horne became the last British person to be executed for what crime?\nAnswer:\nBewitcher\nPassage:\nBlue Peter's theme tune - BBC\nBBC New Talent Under 16s - Blue Peter Music Makers - Theme Tunes\n\u00a0\nBlue Peter's theme tune\nBlue Peter Music Makers gave 40 young musicians the chance to get involved in recording a new version of the theme tune 'Barnacle Bill'.\nThe track    is one of the best known pieces of music on TV and has been used on the programme since the first ever episode in 1958. There have been lots of different versions of the tune but perhaps the most famous is Mike Oldfield's track from 1979, which was also released as a single.\nDemonstration from Mike Oldfield\nMike Oldfield is the man who inspired Murray Gold to become a composer. His version of the Blue Peter theme tune was one of the best loved and included dozens of different instruments, which he all played himself. In this video clip Mike shows former Blue Peter presenter Simon Groom how he put the piece together back in 1979.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote and performed the signature tune from 1979 to 1989.\nAnswer:\nMichael Gordon Oldfield\nPassage:\nFrench Connection (clothing)\nFrench Connection (also branded as FCUK) is a UK-based global retailer and wholesaler of fashion clothing, accessories and homeware. Founded in the early 1970s by Stephen Marks, who remains chief executive, it is based in London and its parent French Connection Group PLC is listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nFrench Connection distributes its clothing and accessories through its own stores in the UK, US and Canada and through franchise and wholesale arrangements globally.  The company became notorious for the use of the \"fcuk\" initialism in its advertising campaigns in the early 2000s.\n\nOther brands currently within the group include Great Plains, Toast and YMC. Former brands include Nicole Farhi.\n\nBrand history\n\nStephen Marks, who started out in business in 1969 as the Stephen Marks brand, established French Connection in 1972 \u2013 a year after the film of the same name was released. Initially designed as a mid-market women's brand, he has said the name came about because he managed to acquire a large shipment of Indian cheesecloth shirts \u2013 via a French contact \u2013 that could be resold in the UK at a large profit. The business expanded into menswear in 1976. \n\nIn 1978, Nicole Farhi joined French Connection as a designer. In 1983, her eponymous higher-end label was launched by the French Connection parent group and this was not sold until 2010. \n\nAfter Marks floated the French Connection brand on the London Stock Exchange in 1984, he was listed as the 15th richest man in Britain, but by the late 1980s the company was in trouble.  He took control of the direction of French Connection again in 1991.\n\nFCUK branding controversy\n\nFrench Connection began using the branding \"fcuk\" (usually written in lowercase, and deliberately similar to the taboo-word \"fuck\") in advertising  after 1991 when Marks regained control.  Reportedly, the first use of the initialism was on faxes sent between Hong Kong and London offices, headed \"FCHK to FCUK\".  Marks said in a subsequent interview that the faxes were not intended to be rude. The advertising campaign came about after he was so impressed by a bra advert featuring Eva Herzigov\u00e1 that he contacted the advertising executive behind it, Trevor Beattie, even though the company did not have a budget for an advertising campaign at the time. It was Beattie who spotted the marketing potential of the initialism and a campaign was launched around it. \n\nUse of this term caused widespread controversy due to its similarity to \"fuck\".  \n\nThe success of the branding in raising French Connection's profile led to similar tactics from other organisations. French Connection launched a trademark infringement case in the London High Court challenging the owner of \"First Consultants UK Ltd\", a computer company, over its use of the \"fcuk\" initialism. The case found that the Internet Domain fcuk.com was registered prior to French Connection applying for the UK Trademark and its claim for passing off was dismissed. Mr Justice Rattee refused to grant an injunction, describing French Connection's use of the initialism as \"a tasteless and obnoxious campaign.\"   The company threatened legal action against the political youth organisation Conservative Future, which had briefly adopted the spoof abbreviation \"cfuk\" (short for \"Conservative Future UK\"). \n\nFollowing a number of complaints about advertising campaigns using the initialism, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority requested that the company submit all poster campaigns for approval before running them. In the United States, the American Family Association urged a boycott of fcuk products.  French Connection stopped using the initialism in advertising in 2005, and reduced its profile in its shops.  However it is still used on certain menswear products and in-store branding.  Despite this lowering of the profile, French Connection remains known as \"fcuk\", particularly by the UK press.  In 2016 it was reported that French Connection was to bring back its FCUK slogan campaign. \n\nBrand position\n\nWhile the revival of the UK brand's fortunes in the 1990s has been attributed to the success of the FCUK logo, it has had mixed financial fortunes during the 2000s, reflected in its poor share prices in the UK.  After reportedly losing market share to rivals such as Zara, Topshop and ASOS \u2013 with some analysts suggesting its pricing was out of step with other competitor brands \u2013 its position improved in 2014.  the French Connection brand had 131 stores in the UK and Europe. \n\nWorldwide operation\n\nFrench Connection distributes its branded womenswear and menswear through a network of owned stores, through franchised stores in major markets around the world, through concessions in department stores in the UK and also through other multi-brand retailers. French Connection also has a variety of licensed products,including eyeglasses, sunglasses, toiletries, shoes, jewellery and watches, which are sold through its own stores and specialist retailers, such as Boots and Specsavers. \n\nOther brands in group\n\nFrench Connection represents the majority of French Connection Group's revenue (some 88 per cent in 2014), however it owns a number of other clothing/homewear brands, including YMC, Great Plains and TOAST.  Toast now has eleven UK stores. \n\nPerfumes\n\nFrench Connection has produced perfumes as an extension to the main clothing brand. This is a partial list \n* Eau de Fcuk No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 \u2013 men's range introduced 2000 and women's perfumes in 2001.\n* Fcuk Her and Fcuk Him (2003) \u2013 Original women's perfume by Zirh/Shiseido and men's perfume by James Krivda.\n* Fcuk Connect Her and Fcuk Connect Him (2007) \u2013 Men's and women's ranges with base notes including musk. \n* Fcuk Friction Her and Friction Him (2012) \u2013 Women's perfume includes notes of coconut and vanilla, men's includes citrus.\nQuestion:\nIn the fashion label FCUK, for what does the FC stand?\nAnswer:\nFrench Connection\nPassage:\nFrangipane\nFrangipane is a filling made from or flavored with almonds. Frangipane/frangipani is derived from frangere il pane (Italian for \"that breaks the bread\"). This filling can be used in a variety of ways  including cakes and such pastries as the Bakewell tart, Conversation tart, Jesuite and Pithivier. A French spelling from a 1674 cookbook is franchipane with the earliest modern spelling coming from a 1732 confectioners' dictionary. Originally designated as a custard tart flavored by almonds or pistachios it came later to designate a filling that could be used in a variety of confections and baked goods. Frangipane is one of France's many traditional foods associated with Christmas celebration. \n\nToday it is normally made of butter, sugar, eggs, and ground almonds.\n\nIn some anecdotes it was the kind of sweet that the noblewoman Jacopa da Settesoli brought to St. Francis of Assisi in 1226, when he was dying.\n\nOn Epiphany, the French cut the King Cake, a round cake made of frangipane layers into slices to be distributed by a child known as le petit roi (the little king) who is usually hiding under the dining table.  The cake is decorated with stars, a crown, flowers and a special bean hidden inside the cake.  Whoever gets the piece of the frangipane cake with the bean is crowned \u201cking\u201d or \u201cqueen\u201d for the following year.\n\nEtymology\n\nFrangipane/frangipani derived from frangere il pane from which the noble Frangipani family of Rome derived its name in the 11th century. A certain Frangipane was perfumier to Louis XIII of France, hence the common name of the flowering tropical trees that are actually in the genus Plumeria. Other people believe it's derived from St. Francis; pane is Italian for bread and Frangi would have been the cognomen of St. Francis.\n\nOther uses\n\nFrangipane can also refer to:\n* A Belgian almond pastry tart.\n*: Usually the individual cakes have a striped pattern on top,  occasionally with icing (resembling a hot cross bun from above).\n* The frangipane (frangipani, Plumeria) tree as in John Vanderslice's song Kookaburra\nQuestion:\nWhat traditionally provides the flavour/flavor in a frangipane cake filling?\nAnswer:\nAlmond tree\nPassage:\nMillion Dollar Mermaid\nMillion Dollar Mermaid (also known as The One Piece Bathing Suit in the UK) is a 1952 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer biographical musical film of the life of Australian swimming star Annette Kellerman. It was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. from a screenplay by Everett Freeman. The music score was by Adolph Deutsch, the cinematography by George J. Folsey and the choreography by Busby Berkeley. \n\nGeorge J. Folsey received a 1953 Oscar nomination for  Best Cinematography, Color. \n\nThe film stars Esther Williams, Victor Mature, and Walter Pidgeon, with David Brian and Donna Corcoran.\n\nPlot\n\nIn the late 19th Century, a polio-stricken Australian girl, Annette Kellerman (Esther Williams), swims as a means to improve her health. Her father, Frederick (Walter Pidgeon), who owns a music conservatory, accepts a teaching position in England.\n\nAboard ship, Annette encounters the American promoter James Sullivan (Victor Mature) and his associate Doc Cronnol (Jesse White), who are taking a boxing kangaroo called Sydney with them to London.\n\nThe teaching position falls through and Jimmy suggests promoting Annette in a six-mile swim to Greenwich. She volunteers to make it 26 miles instead. Word spreads of the swim and Annette's feat makes news.\n\nJimmy suggests they can make a fortune by going to New York and appearing in a water ballet at the Hippodrome.   Manager Alfred Harper (David Brian) does not offer them a job in the show, so Annette goes to Boston for a highly publicized swim and gets in hot water for wearing a one-piece suit too revealing for its time.\n\nShe and Jimmy have a misunderstanding and part ways. Harper has a change of heart and makes Annette headliner of his New York show. After the death of her father, she travels to Montauk at the behest of Doc to try to dissuade Jimmy from flying in an air race with a $50,000 prize. It does not go well.\n\nAs time passes, Harper falls in love with Annette while she travels to Hollywood to make a film. Jimmy and Doc turn up, this time promoting a dog called Rin Tin Tin that they hope to star in the movies.\n\nA water tank bursts during the making of Annette's film, causing her serious injury, Spinal Hematoma.

Coming out of the long-standing medieval tradition of piquant spicy fruit sauces rendered sharply sour with verjuice or vinegar and served with meat, but created sometime in the 19th century,  the sauce appears in various editions of Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. It was named for the Duke of Cumberland, who had ties to Hanover, Germany, where the sauce was invented, according to Alexis Soyer's recipe in The Gastronomic Regenerator  (1846) for a port-wine based sauce accompanying boar\u2019s head, which Janet Clarkson notes \"contains what we think of as the required citrus note in the form of Seville orange rind (along with mustard).\" \nIt is a more complex version of a simple redcurrant sauce\n\nDespite its German origin, today the sauce is ubiquitous in the Cumbria region of England and is thought of as a thoroughly British condiment.\n\nAlthough variations exist, common ingredients include red currants or cowberries, port or claret, dry mustard, pepper, orange, ginger, red currant jelly and vinegar.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the key ingredient of 'Cumberland Sauce'?\nAnswer:\nREDCURRANTS\n", "answers": ["Court (volleyball)", "Volley ball", "Libero (volleyball)", "Serve (Volleyball)", "Spike (volleyball)", "Vollyball", "Spike (Volleyball)", "Outside hitter", "VolleyBall", "Volleyball dig", "Rally point system", "Indoor volleyball", "History of volleyball", "Volleyball", "\ud83c\udfd0", "V-ball", "Lebro", "High school volleyball", "Volley-Ball", "Volley Ball", "Setter (Volleyball)", "Mintonette", "Volleyball court", "VOLLEYBALL", "Serve (volleyball)", "Volleyball rules", "Volley-ball"], "pred": "Question:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:", "length": 11718, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c6cb57b58768f3f5c663a13d6c14ce7d8ab9f0b5d7ac0dce"}

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nHong Kong - Geography - Mari Mari\nHong Kong - Geography\nEconomy l Geography l Government l History l People l Religion\nGeography\nHong          Kong island sits just south of the Tropic of Cancer on similar latitudes          as Calcutta, Havana, and Hawaii, and sharing the same longitude as Wuhan          in central China, Bali, and Perth. Surrounding the country's southern          coast is the South China Sea.\nThe country consists of a peninsular protruding from southeastern China and hundreds          of islands scattered off the coast. Kowloon and the New Territories make          up the peninsular, while south off the mainland is Hong Kong Island and          various other remote islands.\nDeep waters          surround Hong Kong, and with its wide harbors protected by mountains in          the north and south, the region is favorable as a passing point for ships.          Its geographical location between the Taiwan Straits, the South China          Sea, and the Pacific Ocean make it a strategic channel for sea traffic          in Asia and the world.\nSize\nHong Kong          is a small-sized island covering 1,095 sq. km (423 sq. miles). However,          there are currently many reclamation projects at hand, thus expanding          the land area. Hong Kong never used to be as big as it is now. From 1851          to 1997, the total area of land reclaimed from the sea measured to 60          sq. km (23 sq. miles). In area, the island of Hong Kong is 80 sq. km (31          sq. miles), Kowloon peninsular is 47 sq. km (18 sq. miles), the New Territories          is 794 sq. km (306 sq. miles), and the remote islands total 175 sq. km          (67 sq. miles).\nTopography\nHong Kong          stands on volcanic terra firma, with its landscape dominated by hills          and mountains. A crest lining from the northeast to southwest forms the          backbone of Hong Kong. Kowloon peninsular and the northwestern New Territories          are mainly flat areas. Three percent of Hong Kong's total land area is          agriculturally cultivated and this is mostly at the New Territories large          alluvial plains.\nA narrow          piece of flat land between the mountains and the sea along the north shore          in Hong Kong is vacated by most of the country's population, whereas the          south shore has luxury residential buildings and some nice beaches, such          as Stanley and Repulse Bays. There is a tunnel that was built through          the mountains, which links the north and south shores.\nThe highest          peak is Ta Mo Shan, located in central New Territories at 957 meters (3,140          ft) above sea level, while the lowest is Lo Chau Mun at 66 meters (217ft).          Victoria Peak, or 'The Peak', is only 552 meters (1,811ft) but its spectacular          view of Victoria Harbour, Kowloon, and the Central and Wan Chai strip          of Hong Kong Island has made an international reputation for itself.\nIn total,          there are about 234 outlying islands in the country, with the island of          Hong Kong being the most famous and populated. Even then, Hong Kong is          not reputed to be the largest island around. Lantau Island is by far the          biggest of Hong Kong's islands. It has now surfaced from its remoteness          to becoming the site of the new, high-tech Chek Lap Kok international          airport.\nAlthough          Hong Kong dwells on volcanic plains, there are only minor seismic activities,          occasionally causing tremors. To date, no major earthquakes have been          reported, but the last that occurred in the region was back in 1874, with          a magnitude of 5.75 on the Richter scale, which caused only minor damages.\nClimate\nHong Kong          has a subtropical climate because of the wide temperature range and cooler          winters. Even though Hong Kong's latitude is within the tropics, its seasonal          changes are greater than in most places at similar latitudes. Monsoons          and seasonal alternation of winds often dominate the climatic system of          the country.\nSpring occurs          in the months of March to the middle of May. Temperature rises ranges          from 18\ufffd to 27\ufffdC (64\ufffd-80\ufffd F) and humidity averages up to 77 percent. Some,          with fog, constant rain and showers, and only a few moments of sunshine,          consider the transitional period from winter to summer miserable. The          average annual rainfall is 2,200 millimeters, with about 80 percent of          the total falling occurring at this period. Higher statures, such as west          of the New Territories and the southern islands, receive more rainfall          than any other areas.\nFrom June          to mid September, summer takes over. The weather becomes hot and humid,          with temperatures ranging from 26\ufffd to 33\ufffdC (78\ufffd-91\ufffdF) and humidity level          at above 86 percent. It is advisable to always carry an umbrella or to          wear a hat to shield against intense sunshine.\nThe best          times to visit Hong Kong would be during autumn and winter when the air          is dry and cool. These times are between the months of mid September to          February. In autumn, clear sunny days are usually expected and temperatures          range from 18\ufffd to 28\ufffdC (64\ufffd-82\ufffdF). Humidity averages 72 percent. Winter,          on the other hand, starts from mid December to February. January is normally          the coldest month. Temperatures can drop from 20\ufffdC to about 10\ufffdC (50\ufffdF),          with occasional chills.\nVisitors          to Hong Kong during the monsoon period should be wary and prepared with          umbrellas at all times. Dress warmly, or carry along a jacket or sweater          just in case there is a sudden change in weather.\n\u00a0\nBROWSE\nQuestion:\nWhich Australian state capital is on the same longitude as Hong Kong?\nAnswer:\nPerth, AU-WA\nPassage:\nJuliet (moon)\nThere is also an asteroid called 1285 Julietta.\n\nJuliet (  or ) is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986\u00a0U\u00a02. It is named after the heroine of William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. It is also designated Uranus\u00a0XI.\n\nJuliet belongs to Portia Group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 53\u00a0km and geometric albedo of 0.08 virtually nothing is known about Juliet.\n\nAt the Voyager 2 images Juliet appears as an elongated object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Juliet's prolate spheroid is 0.5 \u00b1 0.3, which is rather an extreme value. Its surface is grey in color.\n\nJuliet may collide with Desdemona within the next 100 million years.\nQuestion:\nJuliet, Cupid and Desdemona are moons of which planet?\nAnswer:\nMagnetosphere of Uranus\nPassage:\n2014 Tour de France\nThe 2014 Tour de France was the 101st edition of the Tour de France. It started on 5 July in Leeds, United Kingdom, and concluded on 27 July in Paris, France.    As is traditionally the case in even-numbered years, it followed a clockwise route through France. Italian cyclist Vincenzo Nibali won the race by more than seven minutes, the biggest winning margin since 1997.  \n\nTeams\n\nAll 18 teams in the UCI's Proteam category were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race.  Four UCI Professional Continental teams were also invited. \n\nBefore the start of the race, Chris Froome, Alberto Contador, and Vincenzo Nibali were among the favourites for overall victory.   Froome crashed out of the Tour on stage 5, and Contador followed on stage 10, after breaking his leg in a crash. German rider Jens Voigt competed in his seventeenth and final Tour. \n\nGrand D\u00e9part\n\nThe Grand D\u00e9part team presentation took place on 3 July in Leeds at the First Direct Arena, after a ceremonial ride from the University of Leeds. The ceremony included performances from Embrace and Opera North. \n\nRoute and stages\n\nThe first three stages were in the United Kingdom, starting in Leeds.   This was the fourth Tour de France to contain stages in the United Kingdom (after 1974, 1994 and 2007) and the first edition to contain more than two stages there.\n\nClassification leadership\n\nThere are four main individual classifications contested in the 2014 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important is the general classification, which is calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification will be considered the winner of the Tour.  In 2014, there are no time bonuses given.\n\nThe points classification awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points leads the classification, and is identified with a green jersey.\n\nThe mountains classification is a special points competition awarded to those riders who climb the most difficult ascents the fastest. The organisation categorises some climbs as either hors cat\u00e9gorie, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification are won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The rider with the most mountain points is awarded a polka dot jersey. There were also two special awards, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange given to first rider over the highest climb in the Tour and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass his memorial on the Col du Tourmalet. They did not award any points for the mountains classification, but gave a cash prize of \u20ac5000. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange this year was on the Col d'Izoard in stage 14, and was claimed by Joaquim Rodr\u00edguez and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet was won by Blel Kadri on stage 18.\n\nThe young rider classification, denoted by a white jersey, is calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification is restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1989.\n\nThe team classification is calculated using the finishing times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that lead this classification are identified with yellow numbers and helmets.\n\nIn addition, there is a combativity award, given after each stage to the cyclist considered to be the most combative rider that day; it is awarded by a jury vote.  The winner wears red numbers on the back of his jersey the following day. At the conclusion of the Tour de France, the cyclist who has received the most total votes across all stages is recognized as the most combative rider of the entire Tour.\n\n* In stage 2, Bryan Coquard, who was third in the points classification, wore the green jersey, because Marcel Kittel (in first place) wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification  and Peter Sagan (in second place) wore the white jersey as leader of the young riders' classification during that stage\n* In stages 3\u20135, Romain Bardet, who was second in the young riders' classification, wore the white jersey, because Peter Sagan (in first place) wore the green jersey as leader of the points classification. Also, in stages 6\u20137, Micha\u0142 Kwiatkowski wore the white jersey for the same reason.\n* In stage 14, Joaquim Rodr\u00edguez, who was second in the mountains classification, wore the polka-dot jersey, because Vincenzo Nibali (in first place) wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.\n\nClassification standings\n\nGeneral classification\n\nPoints classification\n\nMountains classification\n\nYoung rider classification\n\nTeam classification\nQuestion:\nIn which city will the 2014 Tour de France begin?\nAnswer:\nLeeds, UK\nPassage:\nCommissioner of Police of the Metropolis\nThe Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis is the head of London's Metropolitan Police Service, classing the holder as a chief police officer. The post is currently held by Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe after his appointment by the Queen on 12 September 2011.  \n\nThe Commissioner is regarded as the highest ranking police officer in the United Kingdom, despite the fact that his authority is generally confined to the Metropolitan Police Service's area of operation, Greater London. However, unlike other police forces the Metropolitan Police has certain national responsibilities such as leading counter-terrorism policing and the protection of the Royal Family and senior members of Her Majesty's Government. Furthermore, the postholder is directly accountable to the Home Secretary and the public nationally amongst many others (the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, the Mayor of London, Londoners) whereas smaller police forces are only accountable to residents and their local Police and Crime Commissioner or police authority.   \nThe rank is usually referred to as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, the Met Commissioner or simply just \"Commissioner\". The Commissioner's annual salary without pension contributions or allowances from 1 September 2010, is \u00a3260,088. \n\nHistory\n\nThe rank of Commissioner was created by the Metropolitan Police Act 1829; until 1855, the post was held jointly by two officers. The Commissioners were Justices of the Peace and not sworn constables until 1 April 1974.  The title Commissioner was not used until 1839.\n\nThe insignia of rank is a crown above a Bath Star, known as \"pips\", above crossed tipstaves within a wreath, very similar to the insignia worn by a full general in the British Army. This badge is all but unique within the British police, shared only with the Commissioner of the City of London Police, the smallest territorial police force, and HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Like all chief officer ranks in the British police, commissioners wear gorget patches on the collars of their tunics. The gorget patches are similar to those worn by generals, aside from being of silver-on-black instead of the Army's gold-on-red. \n\nAt one time, the commissioners were either retired military officers or civil servants. Sir John Nott-Bower, who served as Commissioner from 1953 to 1958, was the first career police officer to hold the post, despite several previous Commissioners having served in senior administrative positions in colonial forces, and the Metropolitan Police itself.  Nott-Bower's successor Sir Joseph Simpson was the first Commissioner to have started his career as the lowest rank of Constable. However, Sir Robert Mark, appointed in 1972, was the first to have risen through all the ranks from the lowest to the highest, as all his successors have done.\n\n, the post of Commissioner is appointed for a period of five years. Applicants are appointed to the post by Her Majesty The Queen, following a recommendation by the Home Secretary under the Police Act 1996.\n\nAs of 2010 the salary of the Commissioner of the Metropolis is \u00a3260,088. \n\nEligibility and accountability\n\n, applicants to the post of Commissioner must be British citizens, and be \"serving UK chief constables or of equivalent UK ranks and above, or have recent experience at these levels\". The post of Commissioner is \"accountable to the Home Secretary; to the MPA, chaired by the Mayor of London; and must answer to Londoners and the public nationally.\" \n\nThis requirement to be a British national has blocked the appointment of non-British Commissioners in the past. In August 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron wanted former Los Angeles Police Department Chief Bill Bratton to become the new Met Police Commissioner, but this was blocked by the Home Office pointing out that the Commissioner has to be British.  , the requirement is set to be scrapped by a proposal made by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary. \n\nList of Commissioners\nQuestion:\nWho is the current Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police?\nAnswer:\nSir Bernard Hogan-Howe\nPassage:\nThe Hay Wain\nThe Hay Wain is a painting by John Constable, finished in 1821, which depicts a rural scene on the River Stour between the English counties of Suffolk and Essex. It hangs in the National Gallery in London and is regarded as \"Constable's most famous image\"  and one of the greatest and most popular English paintings.\n\nPainted in oils on canvas, the work depicts as its central feature three horses pulling a hay wain or large farm cart across the river. Willy Lott's Cottage, also the subject of an eponymous painting by Constable, is visible on the far left. The scene takes place near Flatford Mill in Suffolk, though since the Stour forms the border of two counties, the left bank is in Suffolk and the landscape on the right bank is in Essex.\n\nThe Hay Wain is one of a series of paintings by Constable called the \"six-footers\", large-scale canvasses which he painted for the annual summer exhibitions at the Royal Academy. As with all of the paintings in this series Constable produced a full-scale oil sketch for the work; this is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Constable originally exhibited the finished work with the title Landscape: Noon, suggesting that he envisaged it as belonging to the classical landscape tradition of representing the cycles of nature.\n\nHistory\n\nFlatford Mill was owned by Constable's father. The house on the left side of the painting belonged to a neighbour, Willy Lott, a tenant farmer, who was said to have been born in the house and never to have left it for more than four days in his lifetime. Willy Lott's Cottage has survived to this day practically unaltered, but none of the trees in the painting exist today.\n\nAlthough The Hay Wain is revered today as one of the greatest British paintings, when it was originally exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 (under the title Landscape: Noon), it failed to find a buyer. \n\nIt was considerably better received in France where it was praised by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault. The painting caused a sensation when it was exhibited with other works by Constable at the 1824 Paris Salon (it has been suggested that the inclusion of Constable's paintings in the exhibition was a tribute to G\u00e9ricault, who died early that year). In that exhibition, The Hay Wain was singled out for a gold medal awarded by Charles X of France, a cast of which is incorporated into the picture's frame. The works by Constable in the exhibition inspired a new generation of French painters, including Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\n\nSold at the exhibition with three other Constables to the dealer John Arrowsmith, The Hay Wain was brought back to England by another dealer, D. T. White; he sold it to a Mr Young who resided in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. It was there that the painting came to the attention of the collector Henry Vaughan and the painter Charles Robert Leslie.  On the death of his friend Mr Young, Vaughan bought the painting from the former's estate; in 1886 he presented it to the National Gallery in London, where it still hangs today.  In his will Vaughan bequeathed the full-scale oil sketch for The Hay Wain, made with a palette knife, to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). \n\nThe Hay Wain was voted the second most popular painting in any British gallery, second only to Turner's Fighting Temeraire, in a 2005 poll organised by BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On 28 June 2013 a protester, reported to be connected with Fathers4Justice, glued a photograph of a young boy to the painting while it was on display at the National Gallery. The work was not permanently damaged.\nQuestion:\nWhose cottage is on the left of the Constable painting The Hay Wain?\nAnswer:\nWILLY LOTT\nPassage:\nApostle spoon\nAn apostle spoon is a spoon (usually silver or silver-plated, but sometimes of other metals, such as pewter) with an image of an apostle or other saint as the termination of the handle, each bearing his distinctive emblem. Apostle spoons were particularly popular in Pre-Reformation times when belief in the services of a patron saint was still strong. They symbolize the Last Supper of Christ in the company of the Apostles. Apostle spoons were especially popular in England, but were also found in large numbers in Germany. Fleming, John & Hugh Honour. (1977) The Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts.  London: Allen Lane, p. 27. ISBN 0713909412\n\nOrigins\n\nOriginating in early-fifteenth century in Europe as spoons used at table (often produced in sets of thirteen, the thirteenth, showing Jesus, usually being referred to as the 'Saviour' or 'Master' spoon). The British Museum in London has a set from England dating from 1536\u20137 which has a figure of the Virgin Mary on the thirteenth spoon.  By the sixteenth century they had become popular as baptismal presents for godchildren, but were dying out by the 1660s.  In some communities this tradition continued until at least the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThey first appeared as a bequest in the will of one Amy Brent who, in 1516,  bequeathed \"XIII sylver spones of J' hu and the XII Apostells.\" They are alluded to by the dramatists Ben Johnson, Thomas Middleton, Francis Beaumont, and John Fletcher. Shakespeare refers to it in Henry VIII, Act 5, Scene 3, where Cranmer declines to be sponsor for the infant Elizabeth because of his lack of money. King Henry banters him with \"Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons.\" \n\nSets of the twelve apostles are not common, and complete sets of thirteen, with the figure of Jesus on a larger spoon, are still rarer.\n\nThe spoon shown opposite is typical of single spoons not part of a set.  In this case the apostle is simply holding what appears to be a book. Such examples would typically be in electroplated nickel silver and marked on the rear face with \"EPNS.\"\n\nAttributes\n\nApostle spoons can be known by the attribute mentioned in the following list:\n\n*1 the Master: cross and orb \n*2 Saint Peter: a sword or a key, sometimes a fish\n*3 Saint Andrew: a cross\n*4 Saint James the Greater: a pilgrim's staff\n*5 St. John: the cup of sorrow\n*6 Saint Philip: a staff\n*7 Saint Bartholomew: a knife\n*8 Saint Thomas: a spar\n*9 Saint Matthew: an axe or halbert\n*10 Saint James the Lesser: a fuller's bat\n*11 Saint Jude: a carpenter's set square\n*12 Saint Simon Zealotes: a long saw\n*13 Judas Iscariot: a bag of money\n\nReferences and sources\n\n;References\n\n;Sources\n\n*\n*\nQuestion:\nHow many spoons are there in a full set of Apostle spoons?\nAnswer:\n13\nPassage:\nDoi Inthanon\nDoi Inthanon ( ([http://www.forvo.com/word/doi_inthanon/ pronunciation])) is the highest mountain in Thailand.  It is in Chom Thong District, Chiang Mai Province. This mountain is an ultra prominent peak, known in the past as Doi Luang (meaning \"big mountain\") or Doi Ang Ka, meaning the \"crow's pond top\". Near the mountain's base was a pond where many crows gathered. The name Doi Inthanon was given in honour of King Inthawichayanon, one of the last kings of Chiang Mai, who was concerned about the forests in the north and tried to preserve them. He ordered that after his death his remains be interred at Doi Luang, which was then renamed in his honour.\n\nToday, the summit of Doi Inthanon is a popular tourist destination for both foreign and Thai tourists, with a peak of 12,000 visitors visiting the summit on New Year's Day. In addition to a range of tourist facilities on the summit, there is also a Royal Thai Air Force weather radar station at the summit and the Thai National Observatory (TNO) at km44. \n\nGeography\n\nDoi Inthanon is the highest peak of the Inthanon Range () of the Thanon Thong Chai Range, a subrange of the Shan Hills in the Thai highlands stretching southwards from the Daen Lao Range. This range, the southwesternmost of the Shan Highland system, separates the Salween watershed from the Mekong watershed. Other high peaks of the Loi Lar Mountain Range are Doi Luang Chiang Dao (2,175 m), Doi Pui (1,685 m), and Doi Suthep (1,601 m).\n\nIn 1954, the forests around Doi Inthanon were conserved, creating Doi Inthanon National Park, as one of the original 14 national parks of Thailand.  This park now covers 482.4\u00a0km\u00b2 and spreads from the lowlands at 800 m elevation up to the peak at 2,565 m. Given the varied climatic and ecological areas regions, the park supports a range of animal species, including over 360 bird species.\n\nOn the lower slopes of Doi Inthanon, near the Karen hill tribe village, Ban Sop Had, are the Wachirathan waterfalls (), where the Wachirathan (lit. \"Diamond Creek\") tumbles over a granite escarpment.\n\nClimate \n\nThe climate is typically tropical and fairly cool on the summit of Doi Inthanon. In winter the average temperature is 6\u00a0\u00b0C (43\u00a0\u00b0F) in January and temperatures can sometimes drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F). From March to June, temperatures are pleasant especially at higher altitudes. The rainy season runs from April to November, sometimes it rains often more than 2 hours per day.\n\nThe two chedis\n\nOn the main road to the summit of Doi Inthanon stand two adjacent chedis, one called Naphamethinidon (\u0e19\u0e20\u0e40\u0e21\u0e17\u0e34\u0e19\u0e35\u0e14\u0e25), meaning \"by the strength of the land and air\", and the other, Naphaphonphumisiri (\u0e19\u0e20\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e34), meaning \"being the strength of the air and the grace of the land\". These temples were built to honour the 60th birthday anniversary of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1987, and the 60th birthday anniversary of Queen Sirikit in 1992, respectively.\n\nGeology\n\nGeologically the mountain is a granite batholith in a north-south oriented mountain range. The second-highest peak of this range is Doi Hua Mot Luang at 2,340 m.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:View from Doi Inthanon.jpg|View west from Doi Inthanon\nFile:Mae Ya Waterfall in Doi Inthanon National Park, Chiang Mai, Thailand.jpg|Mae Ya Waterfall\nFile:Doi inthanon control and reporting center.JPG|Doi Inthanon control and reporting center on the summit\nFile:InthanonPeak.jpg|Sign marking the top of Doi Inthanon\nQuestion:\nDoi Inthanon is the highest mountain in which country?\nAnswer:\nMuang Thai\nPassage:\nTAKE THAT - BACK FOR GOOD LIVE 11.12.10 Original Line Up ...\nTAKE THAT - BACK FOR GOOD LIVE 11.12.10 Original Line Up Jason Howard Mark Gary Robbie HD 1920 1080 - YouTube\nFind out why\nClose\nTAKE THAT - BACK FOR GOOD LIVE 11.12.10 Original Line Up Jason Howard Mark Gary Robbie HD 1920 1080\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.\n\nThere are two heptathlons \u2013 the women's heptathlon and the men's \u2013 composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984.\n\nWomen's heptathlon\n\nWomen's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the Athletics program of the Olympics and in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:\n\n* 100 metres hurdles\n* High jump\n* Shot put\n* 200 metres\n* Long jump\n* Javelin throw \n* 800 metres\n\nThe heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added).  It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion.\n\nThere is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.\n\nPoints system\n\nThe heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated \"standard\" performance (for example, approximately 1.82\u00a0m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.  Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75\u00a0m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.\n\nThe events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae: \n\nRunning events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles):\n:P = a \\cdot (b - T)^c\nJumping events (high jump and long jump):\n:P = a \\cdot (M - b)^c\nThrowing events (shot put and javelin):\n:P = a \\cdot (D - b)^c\n\nP is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table).\n\nBenchmarks\n\nThe following table shows the benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:\n\nWomen's world records compared to heptathlon bests\n\nMen's heptathlon\n\n \n\nThe other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:\n\n* 60 metres\n* long jump\n* shot put\n* high jump\n* 60 metres hurdles\n* pole vault\n* 1000 metres\n\nThe scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).  The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nThe following table shows the minimum benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:\n\nMen's world records compared to heptathlon bests\n\nAll-time top 25 athletes\n\nWomen\n\n* \n\nNotes\n\nBelow is a list of all other scores equal or superior to 6875 points.\n*Jackie Joyner-Kersee also scored 7215 (1988), 7158 (1986), 7148 (1986), 7128 (1987), 7044 (1992), 6979 (1987), 6910 (1986), 6878 (1991)\n*Carolina Kluft also scored 7001 (2003), 6952 (2004), 6887 (2005)\n*Jessica Ennis also scored 6906 (2012)\n*Sabine John (Paetz) also scored 6897 (1988)\n*Larisa Nikitina also scored 6875 (1989)\n\nMen\n\n* \n\nMedalists\n\nWomen's Olympic medalists\n\nWomen's World Championships medalists\n\nMen's World Indoor Championships medalists\n\nSeason's bests\n\nWomen's heptathlon\n\nMen's indoor heptathlon\n\nNational records\n\nWomen's heptathlon\n\n* As of July 2016\nQuestion:\nA heptathlon is an athletic contest of how many separate events?\nAnswer:\nSeven\nPassage:\nPipe Smoker of the Year\nPipe Smoker of the Year was an award given out annually by the British Pipesmokers' Council, to honour a famous pipe-smoking individual. Initiated in 1965 as Pipeman of the Year by the Briar Pipe Trade Association, it was presented at a lunch in London's Savoy Hotel each January. The award was discontinued in 2004 because its organisers feared it fell foul of laws banning all advertising and promotion of tobacco. \nThe award was reintroduced in 2014, by the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs, at the British Pipe Smoking Championship at Newark Showground.

The summit lasted from August 29  to September 1 and was attended by eight Arab heads of state: Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, and Sudan.  The resolution called for: a continued state of belligerency with Israel, ending the Arab oil boycott declared during the Six-Day War, an end to the North Yemen Civil War, and economic assistance for Egypt and Jordan. It is famous for containing (in the third paragraph) what became known as the \"Three No's\": \"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it...\" \n\nText of the resolution \n\n#The conference has affirmed the unity of Arab states, the unity of joint action and the need for coordination and for the elimination of all differences. The Kings, Presidents and representatives of the other Arab Heads of State at the conference have affirmed their countries' stand by an implementation of the Arab Solidarity Charter which was signed at the third Arab summit conference in Casablanca.\n#The conference has agreed on the need to consolidate all efforts to eliminate the effects of the aggression on the basis that the occupied lands are Arab lands and that the burden of regaining these lands falls on all the Arab States.\n#The Arab Heads of State have agreed to unite their political efforts at the international and diplomatic level to eliminate the effects of the aggression and to ensure the withdrawal of the aggressive Israeli forces from the Arab lands which have been occupied since the aggression of June 5. This will be done within the framework of the main principles by which the Arab States abide, namely, no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it, and insistence on the rights of the Palestinian people in their own country.\n#The conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil recommended that suspension of oil pumping be used as a weapon in the battle. However, after thoroughly studying the matter, the summit conference has come to the conclusion that the oil pumping can itself be used as a positive weapon, since oil is an Arab resource which can be used to strengthen the economy of the Arab States directly affected by the aggression, so that these States will be able to stand firm in the battle. The conference has, therefore, decided to resume the pumping of oil, since oil is a positive Arab resource that can be used in the service of Arab goals. It can contribute to the efforts to enable those Arab States which were exposed to the aggression and thereby lost economic resources to stand firm and eliminate the effects of the aggression. The oil-producing States have, in fact, participated in the efforts to enable the States affected by the aggression to stand firm in the face of any economic pressure.\n#The participants in the conference have approved the plan proposed by Kuwait to set up an Arab Economic and Social Development Fund on the basis of the recommendation of the Baghdad conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil.\n#The participants have agreed on the need to adopt the necessary measures to strengthen military preparation to face all eventualities.\n#The conference has decided to expedite the elimination of foreign bases in the Arab States.\n\nInterpretations\n\nCommentators have frequently presented the resolution as an example of Arab rejectionism. Efraim Halevy, Guy Ben-Porat, Steven R. David, Julius Stone, and Ian Bremmer all agree the Khartoum Resolution amounted to a rejection of Israel's right to exist.      The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) itself enlisted the Khartoum Resolution to advocate against acceptance of Israel's right to exist as articulated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. \nBenny Morris wrote that the Arab leaders \"hammered out a defiant, rejectionist platform that was to bedevil all peace moves in the region for a decade\". He laid some of the blame with Israel, saying, \"[i]n part [the Arab] stand was a response to Israel's unwillingness or inability to consider withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza as part of any peace settlement\".  Odd Bull of the UNTSO opined in much the same manner in 1976. \n\nAvi Shlaim has argued that Arab spokesmen interpreted the Khartoum declarations to mean \"no formal peace treaty, but not a rejection of peace; no direct negotiations, but not a refusal to talk through third parties; and no de jure recognition of Israel, but acceptance of its existence as a state\" (emphasis in original). Shlaim states that the conference marked a turning point in Arab-Israeli relations, noting that Nasser urged Hussein to seek a \"comprehensive settlement\" with Israel. Shlaim acknowledges that none of this was known in Israel at the time, whose leaders took the \"three no's\" at face value. \n\nIn the event, indirect negotiations between Israel, Jordan and Egypt eventually opened through the auspices of the Jarring Mission (1967-1973), and secret direct talks also took place between Israel and Jordan, but neither avenue succeeded in achieving a meaningful settlement, setting the stage for a new round of conflict.\n\nFootnotes\nQuestion:\n\"The Khartoum Resolution of 1967 that was organized after the Six-Day War became famous for its \"\"Three No's\"\" rejecting what entity?\"\nAnswer:\n\u0130srail\nPassage:\nBrian Wilde - The Full Wiki\nBrian Wilde - The Full Wiki\nThe Full Wiki\nMore info on Brian Wilde\n\u00a0\u00a0Wikis\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNote: Many of our articles have direct quotes from sources you can cite, within the Wikipedia article!

His lugubrious world-weary face was a staple of British television for forty years.\nContents\n4 External links\nCareer\nWhilst born in Ashton-under-Lyne , Lancashire [1] , he was brought up in Devon and Hertfordshire and attended Richard Hale School . He trained as an actor at RADA . [1]\nHe had a small part in the horror film Night of the Demon (1957) and early television roles included the series The Love of Mike (1960) and supporting Tony Hancock in episodes of his ATV series in 1963. He also played Detective Superintendent Halcro in a series of two-part thrillers about undercover Scotland Yard officers, The Men from Room Thirteen (BBC, 1959-61). He had minor roles in films such as Life for Ruth (1962), The Bargee (1964), The Jokers (1967) and Carry On Doctor (1968), and on television in Room at the Bottom (1966-67) as Mr Salisbury. His first major television success was in 1970 as refuse depot manager \"Bloody Delilah\" in the ITV sitcom The Dustbinmen . He showed his sinister side as the mischievous magician Mr Peacock in the children's drama series Ace of Wands between 1970 & 1972. In 1971, he starred as a murderer in The Uninvited, an episode of the BBC's supernatural thriller series Out of the Unknown . Also in 1971, in the television drama Elizabeth R , Wilde played the efficient, merciless 'rackmaster' Richard Topcliffe, who was charged with the torture of prisoners in the Tower of London .\nAdvertisements\nPorridge\nBrian Wilde as prison warder Mr. Barraclough\nIn 1973, he starred as a different kind of gaoler in the second episode of Seven of One , a series of seven individual stories, all of which starred Ronnie Barker . In the episode, entitled \"Prisoner and Escort\", Wilde played Mr Barrowclough , a prison officer whose job it is to escort Barker's character Fletch across the moors to his prison. The episode proved popular and a series was commissioned by the BBC , called Porridge . Wilde reprised his role as the timid and eager-to-please Barraclough. Porridge was popular and successful; it ran until 1977, with a film version being made in 1979.\nLast of the Summer Wine\nWilde established another famous role in 1976, when he took over from Michael Bates as the third member of a trio of old men in the BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine . The character, Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst, was a determined ex-army man who planned the group's misadventures with military precision and a painstaking eye for detail. Wilde saw the long-running series gather momentum and continue its success. He stayed with the series for 9 years before leaving in 1985, to work on other projects. Foggy was written out of the series - it was said that he had moved to Bridlington to take over the family egg painting business - and was replaced by Michael Aldridge as Seymour Utterthwaite until 1990.\nWhen Aldridge left Last of the Summer Wine, Wilde returned as Foggy in 1990, reuniting the series' most popular and enduring line-up. Suffering from a mild infection, Wilde stood down for the first five episodes of the 1997 series in case his illness worsened. His temporary absence was covered by Frank Thornton ; Wilde himself suggested Thornton as a replacement. The filming of a Christmas Special made to introduce Thornton's character resulted in a scheduling problem that made it impossible for Wilde, who was by then fully fit, to return in that series. Producer Alan J.W. Bell said, \"Since then, he has been invited to return many times, but says he feels he has 'done it now' and doesn't want to go back. I am sure that one day he will make an appearance - we still have his costume standing by,\" but Wilde never did return to the role.\nOther works\nIn 1967 the BBC TV series The Avengers episode \"The Fear Merchants\" original air date (UK) 21 January 1967. He played Jeremy Raven a ceramics manufacturer caught up in a sinister plot to get rid of the competition. In 1988 he starred in his own BBC series, Wyatt's Watchdogs as Major Wyatt, a retired soldier, who forms his own neighbourhood watch group. As a stuffy ex-army member who leads a motley bunch of comic characters, Wyatt was quite similar to Foggy. The programme, which co-starred Trevor Bannister , was written by Miles Tredinnick and ran for one series of six episodes.\nDeath\nWilde suffered a fall in January 2008 from which he never recovered. He died in his sleep on the morning of 20 March 2008 at his home in Ware , Hertfordshire . [2] [3]\nTribute\nIn May 2009 it was announced by Danbury Mint that themselves and the BBC had agreed with the sculptor Gordon Brown that as a tribute to Brian Wilde and his Last of the Summer Wine character Foggy Dewhurst that a figurine of \"Foggy\" was to be produced and to be released in July 2009 and will join the \"Last of the Summer Wine Collection\" of 9 other figurines which include Compo, Clegg, Truly, Nora Batty, Howard, Marina, Pearl, Wally Batty and Auntie Wainwright.\nTelevision roles\nQuestion:\nIn \u201cPorridge\u201d which warder was played by Brian Wilde?\nAnswer:\nMr. Barraclough\nPassage:\nKupffer cell\nKupffer cells, also  known as stellate macrophages and Kupffer-Browicz cells, are specialized macrophages located in the liver, lining the walls of the sinusoids that form part of the mononuclear phagocyte system.\n\nHistory\n\nThe cells were first observed by Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer in 1876.  The scientist called them \"Sternzellen\" (star cells or hepatic stellate cell) but thought, inaccurately, that they were an integral part of the endothelium of the liver blood vessels and that they originated from it. In 1898, after several years of research, Tadeusz Browicz identified them, correctly, as macrophages.  \n\nDevelopment\n\nTheir development begins in the yolk sac where they differentiate into fetal macrophages. Once they enter the blood stream, they migrate to the fetal liver where they reside. There they complete their differentiation into Kupffer cells.\n\nFunction\n\nRed blood cells are broken down by phagocytic action, where the hemoglobin molecule is split.  The globin chains are re-utilized, while the iron-containing portion, heme, is further broken down into iron, which is re-utilized, and bilirubin, which is conjugated to glucuronic acid within hepatocytes and secreted into the bile.\n\nHelmy et al. identified a receptor present in Kupffer cells, the complement receptor of the immunoglobulin family (CRIg). Mice without CRIg could not clear complement system-coated pathogens. CRIg is conserved in mice and humans and is a critical component of the innate immune system. \n\nFunction in alcoholic liver disease\n\nKupffer cell activation is responsible for early ethanol-induced liver injury, common in chronic alcoholics.  Chronic alcoholism and liver injury deal with a two hit system.  The second hit is characterized by an activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14, receptors on the Kupffer cell that internalize endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS).  This activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNF\u03b1) and production of superoxides (a\u00a0pro-oxidant).  TNF\u03b1 will then enter the stellate cell in the liver, leading to collagen synthesis and fibrosis.  Fibrosis will eventually cause cirrhosis, or loss of function of the liver.\nQuestion:\nWhere in the body are the Kupffer Cells found?\nAnswer:\nImpressio duodenalis\nPassage:\nDunnock\nThe dunnock (Prunella modularis) is a small passerine, or perching bird, found throughout temperate Europe and into Asia. Dunnocks have also been successfully introduced into New Zealand. It is by far the most widespread member of the accentor family, which otherwise consists of mountain species. Other common names of the dunnock include the hedge accentor, hedge sparrow, or hedge warbler. The name \"dunnock\" comes from the Ancient British *dunn\u0101kos, meaning \"little brown one.\"  However, common or garden English dun (dingy brown, dark-colored) and the diminutive ock would also produce dunnock. Cf. pillock.\n\nDescription\n\nA European robin-sized bird, the dunnock typically measures 13.5\u201314\u00a0cm in length. It possesses a streaked back, somewhat resembling a small house sparrow. Like that species, the dunnock has a drab appearance in order to avoid predation. It is brownish underneath, and has a fine pointed bill. Adults have a grey head, and both sexes are similarly coloured.\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\nDunnocks reside in the more mild western and southern parts of the globe, inhabiting much of Europe including Lebanon, northern Iran, and the Caucasus. Dunnocks were successfully introduced into New Zealand during the 19th century, and are now widely distributed around the country and some offshore islands.   Favourite habitats include woodlands, shrubs, gardens, and hedgerows.\n\nTerritoriality\n\n \n\nThe main call of the dunnock is a shrill, persistent tseep along with a high trilling note, which betrays the bird's otherwise inconspicuous presence. The song is rapid, thin and tinkling, a sweet warble which can be confused with that of the Eurasian wren, but is shorter and weaker.\n\nDunnocks are territorial and may engage in conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Males sometimes share a territory and exhibit a strict dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless, this social dominance is not translated into benefits to the alpha male in terms of reproduction, since parternity is usually equally shared between males of the group.   Furthermore, members of a group are rarely related, and so competition can result. \n\nFemale territorial ranges are almost always exclusive. However, sometimes, multiple males will cooperate to defend a single territory containing multiple females. Males exhibit a strong dominance hierarchy within groups: older birds tend to be the alpha males and first-year birds are usually the betas. Studies have found that close male relatives almost never share a territory.\n\nThe male\u2019s ability to access females generally depends on female range size, which is affected by the distribution of food. When resources are distributed in dense patches, female ranges tend to be small and easy for males to monopolize. Subsequent mating systems, as discussed below, reflect high reproductive success for males and relatively lower success for females. In times of scarcity, female territories expand to accommodate the lack of resources, causing males to have a more difficult time monopolizing females. Hence, females gain a reproductive advantage over males in this case. \n\nBreeding\n\nMating systems\n\nThe dunnock possesses variable mating systems. Females are often polyandrous, breeding with two or more males at once,   which is quite rare among birds. This multiple mating system leads to the development of sperm competition amongst the male suitors. DNA fingerprinting has shown that chicks within a brood often have different fathers, depending on the success of the males at monopolising the female.  Males try to ensure their paternity by pecking at the cloaca of the female to stimulate ejection of rival males' sperm.  Dunnocks take just one-tenth of a second to copulate and can mate more than 100 times a day.  Males provide parental care in proportion to their mating success, so two males and a female can commonly be seen provisioning nestlings at one nest.\n\nOther mating systems also exist within dunnock populations, depending on the ratio of male to females and the overlap of territories. When only one female and one male territory overlap, monogamy is preferred. Sometimes, two or three adjacent female territories overlap one male territory, and so polygyny is favored, with the male monopolising several females.  Polygynandry also exists, in which two males jointly defend a territory containing several females.  Polyandry, though, is the most common mating system of dunnocks found in nature.  Depending on the population, males generally have the best reproductive success in polygynous populations, while females have the advantage during polyandry.\n\nStudies have illustrated the fluidity of dunnock mating systems. When given food in abundance, female territory size is reduced drastically. Consequently, males can more easily monopolise the females. Thus, the mating system can be shifted from one that favours female success (polyandry), to one that promotes male success (monogamy, polygynandry, or polygyny). \n\nNest\n\nThe dunnock builds a neat nest (predominantly from twigs and moss and lined with soft materials such as wool or feathers), low in a bush or conifer, where adults typically lay three to five unspotted blue eggs.\n\nParental care and provisioning\n\nBroods, depending on the population, can be raised by a lone female, multiple females with the part-time help of a male, multiple females with full-time help by a male, or by multiple females and multiple males. In pairs, the male and the female invest parental care at similar rates. However, in trios, the female and alpha male invest more care in chicks than does the beta male. In territories in which females are able to escape from males, both the alpha and beta males share provisioning equally. This last system represents the best case scenario for females, as it helps to ensure maximal care and the success of the young.\n\nA study has found that males tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. However, they do vary their feeding depending on the certainty of paternity. If a male has greater access to a female, and therefore a higher chance of a successful fertilisation, during a specific mating period, it would provide more care towards the young.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the 'Dunnock' more commonly known as?\nAnswer:\nHedge accentor\nPassage:\nPresident of the Confederate States of America\nThe President of the Confederate States of America was the elected head of state and government of the Confederate States. The president also headed the executive branch of government and was commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into Confederate service. \n\nArticle II of the Confederate States Constitution vested the executive power of the Confederacy in the president. The power included the execution of law, alongside the responsibility of appointing executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate. He was further empowered to grant reprieves and pardons, and convene and adjourn either or both houses of congress under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe president was indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a six-year term, and was one of only two nationally elected Confederate officers, the other being the Vice President of the Confederate States. On February 18, 1861, Jefferson Davis became president of the provisional government. On February 22, 1862, he was elected president of the permanent government and served in that capacity until being captured by elements of the United States Cavalry in 1865. \n\nPowers and duties\n\nThe constitutional powers of the President of the Confederate States of America were quite similar to those of the President of the United States of America. The permanent Confederate States Constitution made him commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into service of the Confederate States. He was also empowered to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the Confederate States. He was authorized to make treaties; to nominate and appoint diplomatic representatives, judges, and other officers of the Confederate States (including the heads of the executive departments) by and with the consent of the Confederate States Senate; and to remove such representatives and officers. He could fill vacancies during a recess of the Senate, but he could not reappoint, during a recess, persons previously rejected by it. He was to supply Congress with information, recommend legislation, receive ambassadors and other public ministers, see that the federal laws were faithfully executed, and commission all officers of the military and naval forces of the Confederate States.\n\nElection and oath\n\nOn February 9, 1861, the provisional congress at Montgomery elected Jefferson Davis president and Alexander H. Stephens vice president. Stephens, who was a delegate to Congress from Georgia, was inaugurated on February 11. Davis was inaugurated on February 18 upon his arrival from Mississippi, where he had gone upon his resignation from the U.S. Senate. Davis and Stephens were elected on November 6, 1861, for six-years terms, as provided by the permanent constitution. The Capital had been moved in June 1861, to Richmond, and the inauguration took place at the statue of Washington, on the public square, on February 22, 1862.\n\nBefore Davis entered on the execution of his office as President of the Confederate States, he was constitutionally required to take the following oath or affirmation:\n\nCompensation\n\nIn 1861, the President of the Confederate States earned a $25,000 annual salary, along with an expense account, and a nontaxable travel account.  The President's Office was located on the second floor of the Custom House on Main Street, a structure which also housed the Cabinet Room and the State and Treasury Department. The City of Richmond purchased the Brockenbrough house for presentation to the Confederate government for use as an executive mansion. Davis declined to accept the gift, but the mansion was leased for his use. Referred to as the \"White House of the Confederacy\" or the \"Grey House,\" the mansion was used by President Davis throughout the existence of his presidency. Later it became a repository for documents, relics, and pictures, and in 1896 it was redesignated the Confederate Museum.\n\nPost-presidency\n\nLate on the evening of April 2, 1865, President Davis, his aides, and members of the Cabinet, except Secretary of War Breckinridge, departed from Richmond on the Richmond and Danville Railroad. The Cabinet stayed at Danville, 140 mi miles southwest of Richmond, until April 10, when, hearing of Lee's surrender, it continued farther south. At Greensboro, North Carolina, on April 12 the Cabinet met with Generals Johnston and Beauregard and discussed surrender of Johnston's army to General Sherman. As the railroad south of Greensboro had been destroyed, the flight from that location was on horseback and in ambulances, wagons, and carriages. The last Cabinet meetings took place at Charlotte, on April 24, and 26, and on May 4; when Davis left Washington, Georgia, the party consisted only of his aides and Postmaster General Reagan. Elements of the United States Cavalry captured Davis and his companions at an encampment near Irwinville, May 10, 1865.\n\nJefferson Davis was imprisoned at Fort Monroe, Virginia, until his release on bail on May 13, 1867. During his confinement the United States Government prepared to bring him to trial for treason and for complicity in the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln. He could not be tried in Virginia until the Federal court was reestablished there, but by the time the circuit judges were prepared in May 1867 the United States Government decided the outcome of a trial before a local jury was far too uncertain and dropped the proceedings. In November 1868 Davis was brought to trial under a new indictment, but the judges disagreed and the case was referred to the Supreme Court. President Johnson issued a general amnesty in December 1868, and the Supreme Court entered a nolle prosequi, thus freeing Davis.\nQuestion:\nWho was the president of the Confederate States of America following its formation in 1861?\nAnswer:\nJefferson Davies\nPassage:\nLondon 2012: Team GB wins first Olympic medals - BBC News\nLondon 2012: Team GB wins first Olympic medals - BBC News\nBBC News\nLondon 2012: Team GB wins first Olympic medals\n29 July 2012\nRead more about sharing.\nClose share panel\nImage caption Rebecca Adlington (l) won Team GB's second medal on Sunday, while some events still had empty seats and others were disrupted by rain\nTeam GB has won its first London 2012 medals, with cyclist Lizzie Armitstead taking silver in the women's road race.\nSwimmer Rebecca Adlington has taken bronze in the final of the 400m freestyle.\nLondon 2012 chairman Lord Coe insisted Olympics venues were \"stuffed\" with sports fans, after a row about empty seats on Saturday.\nHowever, on Sunday empty seats could be seen at several sports, including basketball, volleyball and tennis.\nArmitstead, 23, from Otley near Leeds, was beaten to the gold at the end of the 140-kilometre race by Holland's Marianne Vos in a sprint finish on The Mall.\nShe said: \"I'm really, really happy.

Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959.\nUnder Hugo CHAVEZ, president from 1999 to 2013, and his hand-picked successor, President Nicolas MADURO, the executive branch has exercised increasingly authoritarian control over other branches of government. At the same time, democratic institutions have deteriorated, threats to freedom of expression have increased, and political polarization has grown.\nCurrent concerns include: an increasingly politicized military, rampant violent crime, high inflation, and widespread shortages of basic consumer goods, medicine, and medical supplies, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price        fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are endangering the rain        forest and indigenous peoples.\nVenezuela assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2015-16 term.\n(Source: CIA - The World Factbook)\nQuestion:\nSince December 1999, complete the name of this South American country: Bolivarian Republic of .......?\nAnswer:\nISO 3166-1:VE\nPassage:\nVesti la giubba\n\"\" (\"Put on the costume\", sometimes translated as \"On With the Motley\") is a famous tenor aria from Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera Pagliacci. \"\" is sung at the conclusion of the first act, when Canio discovers his wife's infidelity, but must nevertheless prepare for his performance as Pagliaccio the clown because \"the show must go on\".\n\nThe aria is often regarded as one of the most moving in the operatic repertoire of the time.

Bomarsund had not been completed (only two towers of the planned twelve subsidiary towers had been completed). When the war broke out the fortress remained vulnerable especially against forces attacking over land. Designers of the fortress had also assumed that narrow sea passages near the fortress would not be passable for large naval ships; while this assumption had held true during the time of sailing ships, it was possible for steam powered ships to reach weakly defended sections of the fortress.\n\nFirst battle \n\nOn 21 June 1854, three British ships bombarded the Bomarsund fortress. Artillery from the shore, however, responded and, while both sides suffered some damage, the casualties were light. The first battle was indecisive. During the battle, Charles Davis Lucas tossed overboard a shell which had landed on board. The shell exploded before it reached water. For saving his ship he was the first man to be awarded the Victoria Cross. \n\nSecond battle \n\nWhile the first battle had been a brief clash and artillery duel, the second battle was a different affair. By the end of July 1854, a British fleet of 25 ships had surrounded the fortress and only waited for the French ground troops to arrive. Both defender and attacker had acknowledged that the fort could not be defeated by naval forces alone and made preparations accordingly, Russian forces destroyed the surrounding countryside in an effort to force British and French forces break away from the assumed siege.\n\nLanding on 8 August, the British troops established a battery of three 32-pounder guns on a hill, the French establishing several batteries. \nOn 13 August 1854, the French artillery opened fire on a tower and by the end of the day were in a position that while artillery suppressed the defenders of subsidiary tower of Br\u00e4nnklint, French infantry assaulted it.  Defenders found their position to be hopeless and withdrew the bulk of their forces to the main fort leaving only small detachment behind to supervise demolition of the tower. While French troops managed to capture the tower before it was demolished, it did not save the tower since the Russian artillery now opened fire at the captured tower and on 15 August 1854 scored a hit to the gunpowder magazines. The resulting explosion demolished the tower.\n\nThe second tower, Notvik, was also lost on 15 August 1854 after British guns opened fire from their hill opposite to the tower. After eight hours of bombardment they managed to create a gaping hole to the fort. After most of the guns had been lost commandant of the tower surrendered to the British and French forces.\n\nThe bombardment of the main fortress started late on 15 August 1854 with land based guns and the navy opening fire. With only a few guns capable of firing in the direction of the bombarding ships, the Russian forces hoped for the French and British forces to attack over land. However, after the bombardment continued into the 16 August without any indication of landings, it became apparent to the Russian commander that British and French intended to reduce the fortress with artillery fire. As the situation appeared hopeless, Bomarsund surrendered on 16 August 1854.\n\nThe early surrender came as a surprise of the French and British. 2,000 men laid down their arms and became prisoners.\n\nAftermath \n\nAfter the surrender, French and British forces demolished the fortress. British engineers remained until mid-September to ensure it could not be easily rebuilt.\n\nThree hundred Finnish grenadiers defending the fortress were captured and imprisoned in Lewes in the United Kingdom.  They were later allowed to return to Finland, and they returned with a song telling about their battles and imprisonment, called the War of \u00c5land (\"Finnish: Oolannin sota, Swedish: \"Det \u00c5l\u00e4ndska kriget). The Russian Memorial was erected in Lewes in 1877 to honour those who died in captivity.\n\nIn the Treaty of Paris 1856, the entire \u00c5land Islands were demilitarized, which is a status that has been preserved until this day.\n\nThe Bomarsund Bridge connects Bomarsund to the Pr\u00e4st\u00f6 island.\n\nVictoria Cross recipients \n\nIn addition to Charles Davis Lucas several other Victoria Crosses were awarded in the Baltic Theater during the Crimean War.\n\nOther VC recipients for action in the Baltic Sea:\n* John Bythesea - 1854; \u00c5land Islands\n* William Johnstone - 1854; \u00c5land Islands\n* George Ingouville - 1855; Fort of Viborg\n* George Dare Dowell - 1855; Fort of Viborg\n\nTrivia \n\n*A coal mine in Northumberland was named after the battle; the neighboring village still carries the name Bomarsund.\n*In 2007 Orlando Gough's opera The Finnish Prisoner which tells about the events of 1854 had its premiere performance in Lewes.\nQuestion:\nThe Battle of Bomarsund of 1854 was a battle that took place during which war?\nAnswer:\nRusso-Turkish War, 1853-56\nPassage:\nCape Farewell, Greenland\nCape Farewell (;  )  is a headland on the southern shore of Egger Island, Nunap Isua Archipelago, Greenland.

Surrounding the country's southern          coast is the South China Sea.\nThe country consists of a peninsular protruding from southeastern China and hundreds          of islands scattered off the coast. Kowloon and the New Territories make          up the peninsular, while south off the mainland is Hong Kong Island and          various other remote islands.\nDeep waters          surround Hong Kong, and with its wide harbors protected by mountains in          the north and south, the region is favorable as a passing point for ships.          Its geographical location between the Taiwan Straits, the South China          Sea, and the Pacific Ocean make it a strategic channel for sea traffic          in Asia and the world.\nSize\nHong Kong          is a small-sized island covering 1,095 sq. km (423 sq. miles). However,          there are currently many reclamation projects at hand, thus expanding          the land area. Hong Kong never used to be as big as it is now. From 1851          to 1997, the total area of land reclaimed from the sea measured to 60          sq. km (23 sq. miles). In area, the island of Hong Kong is 80 sq. km (31          sq. miles), Kowloon peninsular is 47 sq. km (18 sq. miles), the New Territories          is 794 sq. km (306 sq. miles), and the remote islands total 175 sq. km          (67 sq. miles).\nTopography\nHong Kong          stands on volcanic terra firma, with its landscape dominated by hills          and mountains. A crest lining from the northeast to southwest forms the          backbone of Hong Kong. Kowloon peninsular and the northwestern New Territories          are mainly flat areas. Three percent of Hong Kong's total land area is          agriculturally cultivated and this is mostly at the New Territories large          alluvial plains.\nA narrow          piece of flat land between the mountains and the sea along the north shore          in Hong Kong is vacated by most of the country's population, whereas the          south shore has luxury residential buildings and some nice beaches, such          as Stanley and Repulse Bays. There is a tunnel that was built through          the mountains, which links the north and south shores.\nThe highest          peak is Ta Mo Shan, located in central New Territories at 957 meters (3,140          ft) above sea level, while the lowest is Lo Chau Mun at 66 meters (217ft).          Victoria Peak, or 'The Peak', is only 552 meters (1,811ft) but its spectacular          view of Victoria Harbour, Kowloon, and the Central and Wan Chai strip          of Hong Kong Island has made an international reputation for itself.\nIn total,          there are about 234 outlying islands in the country, with the island of          Hong Kong being the most famous and populated. Even then, Hong Kong is          not reputed to be the largest island around. Lantau Island is by far the          biggest of Hong Kong's islands. It has now surfaced from its remoteness          to becoming the site of the new, high-tech Chek Lap Kok international          airport.\nAlthough          Hong Kong dwells on volcanic plains, there are only minor seismic activities,          occasionally causing tremors. To date, no major earthquakes have been          reported, but the last that occurred in the region was back in 1874, with          a magnitude of 5.75 on the Richter scale, which caused only minor damages.\nClimate\nHong Kong          has a subtropical climate because of the wide temperature range and cooler          winters. Even though Hong Kong's latitude is within the tropics, its seasonal          changes are greater than in most places at similar latitudes. Monsoons          and seasonal alternation of winds often dominate the climatic system of          the country.\nSpring occurs          in the months of March to the middle of May. Temperature rises ranges          from 18\ufffd to 27\ufffdC (64\ufffd-80\ufffd F) and humidity averages up to 77 percent. Some,          with fog, constant rain and showers, and only a few moments of sunshine,          consider the transitional period from winter to summer miserable. The          average annual rainfall is 2,200 millimeters, with about 80 percent of          the total falling occurring at this period. Higher statures, such as west          of the New Territories and the southern islands, receive more rainfall          than any other areas.\nFrom June          to mid September, summer takes over. The weather becomes hot and humid,          with temperatures ranging from 26\ufffd to 33\ufffdC (78\ufffd-91\ufffdF) and humidity level          at above 86 percent. It is advisable to always carry an umbrella or to          wear a hat to shield against intense sunshine.\nThe best          times to visit Hong Kong would be during autumn and winter when the air          is dry and cool. These times are between the months of mid September to          February. In autumn, clear sunny days are usually expected and temperatures          range from 18\ufffd to 28\ufffdC (64\ufffd-82\ufffdF). Humidity averages 72 percent. Winter,          on the other hand, starts from mid December to February. January is normally          the coldest month. Temperatures can drop from 20\ufffdC to about 10\ufffdC (50\ufffdF),          with occasional chills.\nVisitors          to Hong Kong during the monsoon period should be wary and prepared with          umbrellas at all times. Dress warmly, or carry along a jacket or sweater          just in case there is a sudden change in weather.\n\u00a0\nBROWSE\nQuestion:\nWhich Australian state capital is on the same longitude as Hong Kong?\nAnswer:\nPerth, AU-WA\nPassage:\nJuliet (moon)\nThere is also an asteroid called 1285 Julietta.\n\nJuliet (  or ) is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986\u00a0U\u00a02. It is named after the heroine of William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. It is also designated Uranus\u00a0XI.\n\nJuliet belongs to Portia Group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 53\u00a0km and geometric albedo of 0.08 virtually nothing is known about Juliet.\n\nAt the Voyager 2 images Juliet appears as an elongated object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Juliet's prolate spheroid is 0.5 \u00b1 0.3, which is rather an extreme value. Its surface is grey in color.\n\nJuliet may collide with Desdemona within the next 100 million years.\nQuestion:\nJuliet, Cupid and Desdemona are moons of which planet?\nAnswer:\nMagnetosphere of Uranus\nPassage:\n2014 Tour de France\nThe 2014 Tour de France was the 101st edition of the Tour de France. It started on 5 July in Leeds, United Kingdom, and concluded on 27 July in Paris, France.    As is traditionally the case in even-numbered years, it followed a clockwise route through France. Italian cyclist Vincenzo Nibali won the race by more than seven minutes, the biggest winning margin since 1997.  \n\nTeams\n\nAll 18 teams in the UCI's Proteam category were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race.  Four UCI Professional Continental teams were also invited. \n\nBefore the start of the race, Chris Froome, Alberto Contador, and Vincenzo Nibali were among the favourites for overall victory.   Froome crashed out of the Tour on stage 5, and Contador followed on stage 10, after breaking his leg in a crash. German rider Jens Voigt competed in his seventeenth and final Tour. \n\nGrand D\u00e9part\n\nThe Grand D\u00e9part team presentation took place on 3 July in Leeds at the First Direct Arena, after a ceremonial ride from the University of Leeds. The ceremony included performances from Embrace and Opera North. \n\nRoute and stages\n\nThe first three stages were in the United Kingdom, starting in Leeds.   This was the fourth Tour de France to contain stages in the United Kingdom (after 1974, 1994 and 2007) and the first edition to contain more than two stages there.\n\nClassification leadership\n\nThere are four main individual classifications contested in the 2014 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important is the general classification, which is calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification will be considered the winner of the Tour.  In 2014, there are no time bonuses given.\n\nThe points classification awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points leads the classification, and is identified with a green jersey.\n\nThe mountains classification is a special points competition awarded to those riders who climb the most difficult ascents the fastest. The organisation categorises some climbs as either hors cat\u00e9gorie, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification are won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The rider with the most mountain points is awarded a polka dot jersey. There were also two special awards, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange given to first rider over the highest climb in the Tour and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass his memorial on the Col du Tourmalet. They did not award any points for the mountains classification, but gave a cash prize of \u20ac5000. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange this year was on the Col d'Izoard in stage 14, and was claimed by Joaquim Rodr\u00edguez and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet was won by Blel Kadri on stage 18.\n\nThe young rider classification, denoted by a white jersey, is calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification is restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1989.\n\nThe team classification is calculated using the finishing times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that lead this classification are identified with yellow numbers and helmets.\n\nIn addition, there is a combativity award, given after each stage to the cyclist considered to be the most combative rider that day; it is awarded by a jury vote.  The winner wears red numbers on the back of his jersey the following day. At the conclusion of the Tour de France, the cyclist who has received the most total votes across all stages is recognized as the most combative rider of the entire Tour.\n\n* In stage 2, Bryan Coquard, who was third in the points classification, wore the green jersey, because Marcel Kittel (in first place) wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification  and Peter Sagan (in second place) wore the white jersey as leader of the young riders' classification during that stage\n* In stages 3\u20135, Romain Bardet, who was second in the young riders' classification, wore the white jersey, because Peter Sagan (in first place) wore the green jersey as leader of the points classification. Also, in stages 6\u20137, Micha\u0142 Kwiatkowski wore the white jersey for the same reason.\n* In stage 14, Joaquim Rodr\u00edguez, who was second in the mountains classification, wore the polka-dot jersey, because Vincenzo Nibali (in first place) wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.\n\nClassification standings\n\nGeneral classification\n\nPoints classification\n\nMountains classification\n\nYoung rider classification\n\nTeam classification\nQuestion:\nIn which city will the 2014 Tour de France begin?\nAnswer:\nLeeds, UK\nPassage:\nCommissioner of Police of the Metropolis\nThe Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis is the head of London's Metropolitan Police Service, classing the holder as a chief police officer. The post is currently held by Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe after his appointment by the Queen on 12 September 2011.  \n\nThe Commissioner is regarded as the highest ranking police officer in the United Kingdom, despite the fact that his authority is generally confined to the Metropolitan Police Service's area of operation, Greater London. However, unlike other police forces the Metropolitan Police has certain national responsibilities such as leading counter-terrorism policing and the protection of the Royal Family and senior members of Her Majesty's Government. Furthermore, the postholder is directly accountable to the Home Secretary and the public nationally amongst many others (the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, the Mayor of London, Londoners) whereas smaller police forces are only accountable to residents and their local Police and Crime Commissioner or police authority.   \nThe rank is usually referred to as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, the Met Commissioner or simply just \"Commissioner\". The Commissioner's annual salary without pension contributions or allowances from 1 September 2010, is \u00a3260,088. \n\nHistory\n\nThe rank of Commissioner was created by the Metropolitan Police Act 1829; until 1855, the post was held jointly by two officers. The Commissioners were Justices of the Peace and not sworn constables until 1 April 1974.  The title Commissioner was not used until 1839.\n\nThe insignia of rank is a crown above a Bath Star, known as \"pips\", above crossed tipstaves within a wreath, very similar to the insignia worn by a full general in the British Army. This badge is all but unique within the British police, shared only with the Commissioner of the City of London Police, the smallest territorial police force, and HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Like all chief officer ranks in the British police, commissioners wear gorget patches on the collars of their tunics. The gorget patches are similar to those worn by generals, aside from being of silver-on-black instead of the Army's gold-on-red. \n\nAt one time, the commissioners were either retired military officers or civil servants. Sir John Nott-Bower, who served as Commissioner from 1953 to 1958, was the first career police officer to hold the post, despite several previous Commissioners having served in senior administrative positions in colonial forces, and the Metropolitan Police itself.  Nott-Bower's successor Sir Joseph Simpson was the first Commissioner to have started his career as the lowest rank of Constable. However, Sir Robert Mark, appointed in 1972, was the first to have risen through all the ranks from the lowest to the highest, as all his successors have done.\n\n, the post of Commissioner is appointed for a period of five years. Applicants are appointed to the post by Her Majesty The Queen, following a recommendation by the Home Secretary under the Police Act 1996.\n\nAs of 2010 the salary of the Commissioner of the Metropolis is \u00a3260,088. \n\nEligibility and accountability\n\n, applicants to the post of Commissioner must be British citizens, and be \"serving UK chief constables or of equivalent UK ranks and above, or have recent experience at these levels\". The post of Commissioner is \"accountable to the Home Secretary; to the MPA, chaired by the Mayor of London; and must answer to Londoners and the public nationally.\" \n\nThis requirement to be a British national has blocked the appointment of non-British Commissioners in the past. In August 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron wanted former Los Angeles Police Department Chief Bill Bratton to become the new Met Police Commissioner, but this was blocked by the Home Office pointing out that the Commissioner has to be British.  , the requirement is set to be scrapped by a proposal made by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary. \n\nList of Commissioners\nQuestion:\nWho is the current Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police?\nAnswer:\nSir Bernard Hogan-Howe\nPassage:\nThe Hay Wain\nThe Hay Wain is a painting by John Constable, finished in 1821, which depicts a rural scene on the River Stour between the English counties of Suffolk and Essex. It hangs in the National Gallery in London and is regarded as \"Constable's most famous image\"  and one of the greatest and most popular English paintings.\n\nPainted in oils on canvas, the work depicts as its central feature three horses pulling a hay wain or large farm cart across the river. Willy Lott's Cottage, also the subject of an eponymous painting by Constable, is visible on the far left. The scene takes place near Flatford Mill in Suffolk, though since the Stour forms the border of two counties, the left bank is in Suffolk and the landscape on the right bank is in Essex.\n\nThe Hay Wain is one of a series of paintings by Constable called the \"six-footers\", large-scale canvasses which he painted for the annual summer exhibitions at the Royal Academy. As with all of the paintings in this series Constable produced a full-scale oil sketch for the work; this is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Constable originally exhibited the finished work with the title Landscape: Noon, suggesting that he envisaged it as belonging to the classical landscape tradition of representing the cycles of nature.\n\nHistory\n\nFlatford Mill was owned by Constable's father. The house on the left side of the painting belonged to a neighbour, Willy Lott, a tenant farmer, who was said to have been born in the house and never to have left it for more than four days in his lifetime. Willy Lott's Cottage has survived to this day practically unaltered, but none of the trees in the painting exist today.\n\nAlthough The Hay Wain is revered today as one of the greatest British paintings, when it was originally exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 (under the title Landscape: Noon), it failed to find a buyer. \n\nIt was considerably better received in France where it was praised by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault. The painting caused a sensation when it was exhibited with other works by Constable at the 1824 Paris Salon (it has been suggested that the inclusion of Constable's paintings in the exhibition was a tribute to G\u00e9ricault, who died early that year). In that exhibition, The Hay Wain was singled out for a gold medal awarded by Charles X of France, a cast of which is incorporated into the picture's frame. The works by Constable in the exhibition inspired a new generation of French painters, including Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\n\nSold at the exhibition with three other Constables to the dealer John Arrowsmith, The Hay Wain was brought back to England by another dealer, D. T. White; he sold it to a Mr Young who resided in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. It was there that the painting came to the attention of the collector Henry Vaughan and the painter Charles Robert Leslie.  On the death of his friend Mr Young, Vaughan bought the painting from the former's estate; in 1886 he presented it to the National Gallery in London, where it still hangs today.  In his will Vaughan bequeathed the full-scale oil sketch for The Hay Wain, made with a palette knife, to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). \n\nThe Hay Wain was voted the second most popular painting in any British gallery, second only to Turner's Fighting Temeraire, in a 2005 poll organised by BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On 28 June 2013 a protester, reported to be connected with Fathers4Justice, glued a photograph of a young boy to the painting while it was on display at the National Gallery. The work was not permanently damaged.\nQuestion:\nWhose cottage is on the left of the Constable painting The Hay Wain?\nAnswer:\nWILLY LOTT\nPassage:\nApostle spoon\nAn apostle spoon is a spoon (usually silver or silver-plated, but sometimes of other metals, such as pewter) with an image of an apostle or other saint as the termination of the handle, each bearing his distinctive emblem. Apostle spoons were particularly popular in Pre-Reformation times when belief in the services of a patron saint was still strong. They symbolize the Last Supper of Christ in the company of the Apostles. Apostle spoons were especially popular in England, but were also found in large numbers in Germany. Fleming, John & Hugh Honour. (1977) The Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts.  London: Allen Lane, p. 27. ISBN 0713909412\n\nOrigins\n\nOriginating in early-fifteenth century in Europe as spoons used at table (often produced in sets of thirteen, the thirteenth, showing Jesus, usually being referred to as the 'Saviour' or 'Master' spoon). The British Museum in London has a set from England dating from 1536\u20137 which has a figure of the Virgin Mary on the thirteenth spoon.  By the sixteenth century they had become popular as baptismal presents for godchildren, but were dying out by the 1660s.  In some communities this tradition continued until at least the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThey first appeared as a bequest in the will of one Amy Brent who, in 1516,  bequeathed \"XIII sylver spones of J' hu and the XII Apostells.\" They are alluded to by the dramatists Ben Johnson, Thomas Middleton, Francis Beaumont, and John Fletcher. Shakespeare refers to it in Henry VIII, Act 5, Scene 3, where Cranmer declines to be sponsor for the infant Elizabeth because of his lack of money. King Henry banters him with \"Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons.\" \n\nSets of the twelve apostles are not common, and complete sets of thirteen, with the figure of Jesus on a larger spoon, are still rarer.\n\nThe spoon shown opposite is typical of single spoons not part of a set.  In this case the apostle is simply holding what appears to be a book. Such examples would typically be in electroplated nickel silver and marked on the rear face with \"EPNS.\"\n\nAttributes\n\nApostle spoons can be known by the attribute mentioned in the following list:\n\n*1 the Master: cross and orb \n*2 Saint Peter: a sword or a key, sometimes a fish\n*3 Saint Andrew: a cross\n*4 Saint James the Greater: a pilgrim's staff\n*5 St. John: the cup of sorrow\n*6 Saint Philip: a staff\n*7 Saint Bartholomew: a knife\n*8 Saint Thomas: a spar\n*9 Saint Matthew: an axe or halbert\n*10 Saint James the Lesser: a fuller's bat\n*11 Saint Jude: a carpenter's set square\n*12 Saint Simon Zealotes: a long saw\n*13 Judas Iscariot: a bag of money\n\nReferences and sources\n\n;References\n\n;Sources\n\n*\n*\nQuestion:\nHow many spoons are there in a full set of Apostle spoons?\nAnswer:\n13\nPassage:\nDoi Inthanon\nDoi Inthanon ( ([http://www.forvo.com/word/doi_inthanon/ pronunciation])) is the highest mountain in Thailand.  It is in Chom Thong District, Chiang Mai Province. This mountain is an ultra prominent peak, known in the past as Doi Luang (meaning \"big mountain\") or Doi Ang Ka, meaning the \"crow's pond top\". Near the mountain's base was a pond where many crows gathered. The name Doi Inthanon was given in honour of King Inthawichayanon, one of the last kings of Chiang Mai, who was concerned about the forests in the north and tried to preserve them. He ordered that after his death his remains be interred at Doi Luang, which was then renamed in his honour.\n\nToday, the summit of Doi Inthanon is a popular tourist destination for both foreign and Thai tourists, with a peak of 12,000 visitors visiting the summit on New Year's Day. In addition to a range of tourist facilities on the summit, there is also a Royal Thai Air Force weather radar station at the summit and the Thai National Observatory (TNO) at km44. \n\nGeography\n\nDoi Inthanon is the highest peak of the Inthanon Range () of the Thanon Thong Chai Range, a subrange of the Shan Hills in the Thai highlands stretching southwards from the Daen Lao Range. This range, the southwesternmost of the Shan Highland system, separates the Salween watershed from the Mekong watershed. Other high peaks of the Loi Lar Mountain Range are Doi Luang Chiang Dao (2,175 m), Doi Pui (1,685 m), and Doi Suthep (1,601 m).\n\nIn 1954, the forests around Doi Inthanon were conserved, creating Doi Inthanon National Park, as one of the original 14 national parks of Thailand.  This park now covers 482.4\u00a0km\u00b2 and spreads from the lowlands at 800 m elevation up to the peak at 2,565 m. Given the varied climatic and ecological areas regions, the park supports a range of animal species, including over 360 bird species.\n\nOn the lower slopes of Doi Inthanon, near the Karen hill tribe village, Ban Sop Had, are the Wachirathan waterfalls (), where the Wachirathan (lit. \"Diamond Creek\") tumbles over a granite escarpment.\n\nClimate \n\nThe climate is typically tropical and fairly cool on the summit of Doi Inthanon. In winter the average temperature is 6\u00a0\u00b0C (43\u00a0\u00b0F) in January and temperatures can sometimes drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F). From March to June, temperatures are pleasant especially at higher altitudes. The rainy season runs from April to November, sometimes it rains often more than 2 hours per day.\n\nThe two chedis\n\nOn the main road to the summit of Doi Inthanon stand two adjacent chedis, one called Naphamethinidon (\u0e19\u0e20\u0e40\u0e21\u0e17\u0e34\u0e19\u0e35\u0e14\u0e25), meaning \"by the strength of the land and air\", and the other, Naphaphonphumisiri (\u0e19\u0e20\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e34), meaning \"being the strength of the air and the grace of the land\". These temples were built to honour the 60th birthday anniversary of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1987, and the 60th birthday anniversary of Queen Sirikit in 1992, respectively.\n\nGeology\n\nGeologically the mountain is a granite batholith in a north-south oriented mountain range. The second-highest peak of this range is Doi Hua Mot Luang at 2,340 m.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:View from Doi Inthanon.jpg|View west from Doi Inthanon\nFile:Mae Ya Waterfall in Doi Inthanon National Park, Chiang Mai, Thailand.jpg|Mae Ya Waterfall\nFile:Doi inthanon control and reporting center.JPG|Doi Inthanon control and reporting center on the summit\nFile:InthanonPeak.jpg|Sign marking the top of Doi Inthanon\nQuestion:\nDoi Inthanon is the highest mountain in which country?\nAnswer:\nMuang Thai\nPassage:\nTAKE THAT - BACK FOR GOOD LIVE 11.12.10 Original Line Up ...\nTAKE THAT - BACK FOR GOOD LIVE 11.12.10 Original Line Up Jason Howard Mark Gary Robbie HD 1920 1080 - YouTube\nFind out why\nClose\nTAKE THAT - BACK FOR GOOD LIVE 11.12.10 Original Line Up Jason Howard Mark Gary Robbie HD 1920 1080\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.\n\nThere are two heptathlons \u2013 the women's heptathlon and the men's \u2013 composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984.\n\nWomen's heptathlon\n\nWomen's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the Athletics program of the Olympics and in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:\n\n* 100 metres hurdles\n* High jump\n* Shot put\n* 200 metres\n* Long jump\n* Javelin throw \n* 800 metres\n\nThe heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added).  It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion.\n\nThere is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.\n\nPoints system\n\nThe heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated \"standard\" performance (for example, approximately 1.82\u00a0m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.  Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75\u00a0m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.\n\nThe events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae: \n\nRunning events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles):\n:P = a \\cdot (b - T)^c\nJumping events (high jump and long jump):\n:P = a \\cdot (M - b)^c\nThrowing events (shot put and javelin):\n:P = a \\cdot (D - b)^c\n\nP is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table).\n\nBenchmarks\n\nThe following table shows the benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:\n\nWomen's world records compared to heptathlon bests\n\nMen's heptathlon\n\n \n\nThe other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:\n\n* 60 metres\n* long jump\n* shot put\n* high jump\n* 60 metres hurdles\n* pole vault\n* 1000 metres\n\nThe scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).  The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nThe following table shows the minimum benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:\n\nMen's world records compared to heptathlon bests\n\nAll-time top 25 athletes\n\nWomen\n\n* \n\nNotes\n\nBelow is a list of all other scores equal or superior to 6875 points.\n*Jackie Joyner-Kersee also scored 7215 (1988), 7158 (1986), 7148 (1986), 7128 (1987), 7044 (1992), 6979 (1987), 6910 (1986), 6878 (1991)\n*Carolina Kluft also scored 7001 (2003), 6952 (2004), 6887 (2005)\n*Jessica Ennis also scored 6906 (2012)\n*Sabine John (Paetz) also scored 6897 (1988)\n*Larisa Nikitina also scored 6875 (1989)\n\nMen\n\n* \n\nMedalists\n\nWomen's Olympic medalists\n\nWomen's World Championships medalists\n\nMen's World Indoor Championships medalists\n\nSeason's bests\n\nWomen's heptathlon\n\nMen's indoor heptathlon\n\nNational records\n\nWomen's heptathlon\n\n* As of July 2016\nQuestion:\nA heptathlon is an athletic contest of how many separate events?\nAnswer:\nSeven\nPassage:\nPipe Smoker of the Year\nPipe Smoker of the Year was an award given out annually by the British Pipesmokers' Council, to honour a famous pipe-smoking individual. Initiated in 1965 as Pipeman of the Year by the Briar Pipe Trade Association, it was presented at a lunch in London's Savoy Hotel each January. The award was discontinued in 2004 because its organisers feared it fell foul of laws banning all advertising and promotion of tobacco. \nThe award was reintroduced in 2014, by the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs, at the British Pipe Smoking Championship at Newark Showground. In a departure from previous awards the recipient was not a celebrity, but the outgoing President of the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs Brian Mills, in recognition for his personal contribution in recommencing the British Pipe Smoking Championships.\n\nPipe Smokers of the Year\n\n* 1964 \u2013 Rupert Davies\n* 1965 \u2013 Harold Wilson\n* 1966 \u2013 Andrew Cruickshank\n* 1967 \u2013 Warren Mitchell\n* 1968 \u2013 Peter Cushing\n* 1969 \u2013 Jack Hargreaves\n* 1970 \u2013 Eric Morecambe\n* 1971/72 \u2013 Lord Shinwell\n* 1973 \u2013 Frank Muir\n* 1974 \u2013 Fred Trueman\n* 1975 \u2013 Campbell Adamson\n* 1976 \u2013 Harold Wilson (Pipeman of the Decade)\n* 1977 \u2013 Brian Barnes\n* 1978 \u2013 Magnus Magnusson\n* 1979 \u2013 J.

The summit lasted from August 29  to September 1 and was attended by eight Arab heads of state: Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, and Sudan.  The resolution called for: a continued state of belligerency with Israel, ending the Arab oil boycott declared during the Six-Day War, an end to the North Yemen Civil War, and economic assistance for Egypt and Jordan. It is famous for containing (in the third paragraph) what became known as the \"Three No's\": \"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it...\" \n\nText of the resolution \n\n#The conference has affirmed the unity of Arab states, the unity of joint action and the need for coordination and for the elimination of all differences. The Kings, Presidents and representatives of the other Arab Heads of State at the conference have affirmed their countries' stand by an implementation of the Arab Solidarity Charter which was signed at the third Arab summit conference in Casablanca.\n#The conference has agreed on the need to consolidate all efforts to eliminate the effects of the aggression on the basis that the occupied lands are Arab lands and that the burden of regaining these lands falls on all the Arab States.\n#The Arab Heads of State have agreed to unite their political efforts at the international and diplomatic level to eliminate the effects of the aggression and to ensure the withdrawal of the aggressive Israeli forces from the Arab lands which have been occupied since the aggression of June 5. This will be done within the framework of the main principles by which the Arab States abide, namely, no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it, and insistence on the rights of the Palestinian people in their own country.\n#The conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil recommended that suspension of oil pumping be used as a weapon in the battle. However, after thoroughly studying the matter, the summit conference has come to the conclusion that the oil pumping can itself be used as a positive weapon, since oil is an Arab resource which can be used to strengthen the economy of the Arab States directly affected by the aggression, so that these States will be able to stand firm in the battle. The conference has, therefore, decided to resume the pumping of oil, since oil is a positive Arab resource that can be used in the service of Arab goals. It can contribute to the efforts to enable those Arab States which were exposed to the aggression and thereby lost economic resources to stand firm and eliminate the effects of the aggression. The oil-producing States have, in fact, participated in the efforts to enable the States affected by the aggression to stand firm in the face of any economic pressure.\n#The participants in the conference have approved the plan proposed by Kuwait to set up an Arab Economic and Social Development Fund on the basis of the recommendation of the Baghdad conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil.\n#The participants have agreed on the need to adopt the necessary measures to strengthen military preparation to face all eventualities.\n#The conference has decided to expedite the elimination of foreign bases in the Arab States.\n\nInterpretations\n\nCommentators have frequently presented the resolution as an example of Arab rejectionism. Efraim Halevy, Guy Ben-Porat, Steven R. David, Julius Stone, and Ian Bremmer all agree the Khartoum Resolution amounted to a rejection of Israel's right to exist.      The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) itself enlisted the Khartoum Resolution to advocate against acceptance of Israel's right to exist as articulated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. \nBenny Morris wrote that the Arab leaders \"hammered out a defiant, rejectionist platform that was to bedevil all peace moves in the region for a decade\". He laid some of the blame with Israel, saying, \"[i]n part [the Arab] stand was a response to Israel's unwillingness or inability to consider withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza as part of any peace settlement\".  Odd Bull of the UNTSO opined in much the same manner in 1976. \n\nAvi Shlaim has argued that Arab spokesmen interpreted the Khartoum declarations to mean \"no formal peace treaty, but not a rejection of peace; no direct negotiations, but not a refusal to talk through third parties; and no de jure recognition of Israel, but acceptance of its existence as a state\" (emphasis in original). Shlaim states that the conference marked a turning point in Arab-Israeli relations, noting that Nasser urged Hussein to seek a \"comprehensive settlement\" with Israel. Shlaim acknowledges that none of this was known in Israel at the time, whose leaders took the \"three no's\" at face value. \n\nIn the event, indirect negotiations between Israel, Jordan and Egypt eventually opened through the auspices of the Jarring Mission (1967-1973), and secret direct talks also took place between Israel and Jordan, but neither avenue succeeded in achieving a meaningful settlement, setting the stage for a new round of conflict.\n\nFootnotes\nQuestion:\n\"The Khartoum Resolution of 1967 that was organized after the Six-Day War became famous for its \"\"Three No's\"\" rejecting what entity?\"\nAnswer:\n\u0130srail\nPassage:\nBrian Wilde - The Full Wiki\nBrian Wilde - The Full Wiki\nThe Full Wiki\nMore info on Brian Wilde\n\u00a0\u00a0Wikis\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNote: Many of our articles have direct quotes from sources you can cite, within the Wikipedia article!

His lugubrious world-weary face was a staple of British television for forty years.\nContents\n4 External links\nCareer\nWhilst born in Ashton-under-Lyne , Lancashire [1] , he was brought up in Devon and Hertfordshire and attended Richard Hale School . He trained as an actor at RADA . [1]\nHe had a small part in the horror film Night of the Demon (1957) and early television roles included the series The Love of Mike (1960) and supporting Tony Hancock in episodes of his ATV series in 1963. He also played Detective Superintendent Halcro in a series of two-part thrillers about undercover Scotland Yard officers, The Men from Room Thirteen (BBC, 1959-61). He had minor roles in films such as Life for Ruth (1962), The Bargee (1964), The Jokers (1967) and Carry On Doctor (1968), and on television in Room at the Bottom (1966-67) as Mr Salisbury. His first major television success was in 1970 as refuse depot manager \"Bloody Delilah\" in the ITV sitcom The Dustbinmen . He showed his sinister side as the mischievous magician Mr Peacock in the children's drama series Ace of Wands between 1970 & 1972. In 1971, he starred as a murderer in The Uninvited, an episode of the BBC's supernatural thriller series Out of the Unknown . Also in 1971, in the television drama Elizabeth R , Wilde played the efficient, merciless 'rackmaster' Richard Topcliffe, who was charged with the torture of prisoners in the Tower of London .\nAdvertisements\nPorridge\nBrian Wilde as prison warder Mr. Barraclough\nIn 1973, he starred as a different kind of gaoler in the second episode of Seven of One , a series of seven individual stories, all of which starred Ronnie Barker . In the episode, entitled \"Prisoner and Escort\", Wilde played Mr Barrowclough , a prison officer whose job it is to escort Barker's character Fletch across the moors to his prison. The episode proved popular and a series was commissioned by the BBC , called Porridge . Wilde reprised his role as the timid and eager-to-please Barraclough. Porridge was popular and successful; it ran until 1977, with a film version being made in 1979.\nLast of the Summer Wine\nWilde established another famous role in 1976, when he took over from Michael Bates as the third member of a trio of old men in the BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine . The character, Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst, was a determined ex-army man who planned the group's misadventures with military precision and a painstaking eye for detail. Wilde saw the long-running series gather momentum and continue its success. He stayed with the series for 9 years before leaving in 1985, to work on other projects. Foggy was written out of the series - it was said that he had moved to Bridlington to take over the family egg painting business - and was replaced by Michael Aldridge as Seymour Utterthwaite until 1990.\nWhen Aldridge left Last of the Summer Wine, Wilde returned as Foggy in 1990, reuniting the series' most popular and enduring line-up. Suffering from a mild infection, Wilde stood down for the first five episodes of the 1997 series in case his illness worsened. His temporary absence was covered by Frank Thornton ; Wilde himself suggested Thornton as a replacement. The filming of a Christmas Special made to introduce Thornton's character resulted in a scheduling problem that made it impossible for Wilde, who was by then fully fit, to return in that series. Producer Alan J.W. Bell said, \"Since then, he has been invited to return many times, but says he feels he has 'done it now' and doesn't want to go back. I am sure that one day he will make an appearance - we still have his costume standing by,\" but Wilde never did return to the role.\nOther works\nIn 1967 the BBC TV series The Avengers episode \"The Fear Merchants\" original air date (UK) 21 January 1967. He played Jeremy Raven a ceramics manufacturer caught up in a sinister plot to get rid of the competition. In 1988 he starred in his own BBC series, Wyatt's Watchdogs as Major Wyatt, a retired soldier, who forms his own neighbourhood watch group. As a stuffy ex-army member who leads a motley bunch of comic characters, Wyatt was quite similar to Foggy. The programme, which co-starred Trevor Bannister , was written by Miles Tredinnick and ran for one series of six episodes.\nDeath\nWilde suffered a fall in January 2008 from which he never recovered. He died in his sleep on the morning of 20 March 2008 at his home in Ware , Hertfordshire .

The scientist called them \"Sternzellen\" (star cells or hepatic stellate cell) but thought, inaccurately, that they were an integral part of the endothelium of the liver blood vessels and that they originated from it. In 1898, after several years of research, Tadeusz Browicz identified them, correctly, as macrophages.  \n\nDevelopment\n\nTheir development begins in the yolk sac where they differentiate into fetal macrophages. Once they enter the blood stream, they migrate to the fetal liver where they reside. There they complete their differentiation into Kupffer cells.\n\nFunction\n\nRed blood cells are broken down by phagocytic action, where the hemoglobin molecule is split.  The globin chains are re-utilized, while the iron-containing portion, heme, is further broken down into iron, which is re-utilized, and bilirubin, which is conjugated to glucuronic acid within hepatocytes and secreted into the bile.\n\nHelmy et al. identified a receptor present in Kupffer cells, the complement receptor of the immunoglobulin family (CRIg). Mice without CRIg could not clear complement system-coated pathogens. CRIg is conserved in mice and humans and is a critical component of the innate immune system. \n\nFunction in alcoholic liver disease\n\nKupffer cell activation is responsible for early ethanol-induced liver injury, common in chronic alcoholics.  Chronic alcoholism and liver injury deal with a two hit system.  The second hit is characterized by an activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14, receptors on the Kupffer cell that internalize endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS).  This activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNF\u03b1) and production of superoxides (a\u00a0pro-oxidant).  TNF\u03b1 will then enter the stellate cell in the liver, leading to collagen synthesis and fibrosis.  Fibrosis will eventually cause cirrhosis, or loss of function of the liver.\nQuestion:\nWhere in the body are the Kupffer Cells found?\nAnswer:\nImpressio duodenalis\nPassage:\nDunnock\nThe dunnock (Prunella modularis) is a small passerine, or perching bird, found throughout temperate Europe and into Asia. Dunnocks have also been successfully introduced into New Zealand. It is by far the most widespread member of the accentor family, which otherwise consists of mountain species. Other common names of the dunnock include the hedge accentor, hedge sparrow, or hedge warbler. The name \"dunnock\" comes from the Ancient British *dunn\u0101kos, meaning \"little brown one.\"  However, common or garden English dun (dingy brown, dark-colored) and the diminutive ock would also produce dunnock. Cf. pillock.\n\nDescription\n\nA European robin-sized bird, the dunnock typically measures 13.5\u201314\u00a0cm in length. It possesses a streaked back, somewhat resembling a small house sparrow. Like that species, the dunnock has a drab appearance in order to avoid predation. It is brownish underneath, and has a fine pointed bill. Adults have a grey head, and both sexes are similarly coloured.\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\nDunnocks reside in the more mild western and southern parts of the globe, inhabiting much of Europe including Lebanon, northern Iran, and the Caucasus. Dunnocks were successfully introduced into New Zealand during the 19th century, and are now widely distributed around the country and some offshore islands.   Favourite habitats include woodlands, shrubs, gardens, and hedgerows.\n\nTerritoriality\n\n \n\nThe main call of the dunnock is a shrill, persistent tseep along with a high trilling note, which betrays the bird's otherwise inconspicuous presence. The song is rapid, thin and tinkling, a sweet warble which can be confused with that of the Eurasian wren, but is shorter and weaker.\n\nDunnocks are territorial and may engage in conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Males sometimes share a territory and exhibit a strict dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless, this social dominance is not translated into benefits to the alpha male in terms of reproduction, since parternity is usually equally shared between males of the group.   Furthermore, members of a group are rarely related, and so competition can result. \n\nFemale territorial ranges are almost always exclusive. However, sometimes, multiple males will cooperate to defend a single territory containing multiple females. Males exhibit a strong dominance hierarchy within groups: older birds tend to be the alpha males and first-year birds are usually the betas. Studies have found that close male relatives almost never share a territory.\n\nThe male\u2019s ability to access females generally depends on female range size, which is affected by the distribution of food. When resources are distributed in dense patches, female ranges tend to be small and easy for males to monopolize. Subsequent mating systems, as discussed below, reflect high reproductive success for males and relatively lower success for females. In times of scarcity, female territories expand to accommodate the lack of resources, causing males to have a more difficult time monopolizing females. Hence, females gain a reproductive advantage over males in this case. \n\nBreeding\n\nMating systems\n\nThe dunnock possesses variable mating systems. Females are often polyandrous, breeding with two or more males at once,   which is quite rare among birds. This multiple mating system leads to the development of sperm competition amongst the male suitors. DNA fingerprinting has shown that chicks within a brood often have different fathers, depending on the success of the males at monopolising the female.  Males try to ensure their paternity by pecking at the cloaca of the female to stimulate ejection of rival males' sperm.  Dunnocks take just one-tenth of a second to copulate and can mate more than 100 times a day.  Males provide parental care in proportion to their mating success, so two males and a female can commonly be seen provisioning nestlings at one nest.\n\nOther mating systems also exist within dunnock populations, depending on the ratio of male to females and the overlap of territories. When only one female and one male territory overlap, monogamy is preferred. Sometimes, two or three adjacent female territories overlap one male territory, and so polygyny is favored, with the male monopolising several females.  Polygynandry also exists, in which two males jointly defend a territory containing several females.  Polyandry, though, is the most common mating system of dunnocks found in nature.  Depending on the population, males generally have the best reproductive success in polygynous populations, while females have the advantage during polyandry.\n\nStudies have illustrated the fluidity of dunnock mating systems. When given food in abundance, female territory size is reduced drastically. Consequently, males can more easily monopolise the females. Thus, the mating system can be shifted from one that favours female success (polyandry), to one that promotes male success (monogamy, polygynandry, or polygyny). \n\nNest\n\nThe dunnock builds a neat nest (predominantly from twigs and moss and lined with soft materials such as wool or feathers), low in a bush or conifer, where adults typically lay three to five unspotted blue eggs.\n\nParental care and provisioning\n\nBroods, depending on the population, can be raised by a lone female, multiple females with the part-time help of a male, multiple females with full-time help by a male, or by multiple females and multiple males. In pairs, the male and the female invest parental care at similar rates. However, in trios, the female and alpha male invest more care in chicks than does the beta male. In territories in which females are able to escape from males, both the alpha and beta males share provisioning equally. This last system represents the best case scenario for females, as it helps to ensure maximal care and the success of the young.\n\nA study has found that males tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. However, they do vary their feeding depending on the certainty of paternity. If a male has greater access to a female, and therefore a higher chance of a successful fertilisation, during a specific mating period, it would provide more care towards the young.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the 'Dunnock' more commonly known as?\nAnswer:\nHedge accentor\nPassage:\nPresident of the Confederate States of America\nThe President of the Confederate States of America was the elected head of state and government of the Confederate States. The president also headed the executive branch of government and was commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into Confederate service. \n\nArticle II of the Confederate States Constitution vested the executive power of the Confederacy in the president. The power included the execution of law, alongside the responsibility of appointing executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate. He was further empowered to grant reprieves and pardons, and convene and adjourn either or both houses of congress under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe president was indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a six-year term, and was one of only two nationally elected Confederate officers, the other being the Vice President of the Confederate States. On February 18, 1861, Jefferson Davis became president of the provisional government. On February 22, 1862, he was elected president of the permanent government and served in that capacity until being captured by elements of the United States Cavalry in 1865. \n\nPowers and duties\n\nThe constitutional powers of the President of the Confederate States of America were quite similar to those of the President of the United States of America. The permanent Confederate States Constitution made him commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into service of the Confederate States. He was also empowered to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the Confederate States. He was authorized to make treaties; to nominate and appoint diplomatic representatives, judges, and other officers of the Confederate States (including the heads of the executive departments) by and with the consent of the Confederate States Senate; and to remove such representatives and officers. He could fill vacancies during a recess of the Senate, but he could not reappoint, during a recess, persons previously rejected by it. He was to supply Congress with information, recommend legislation, receive ambassadors and other public ministers, see that the federal laws were faithfully executed, and commission all officers of the military and naval forces of the Confederate States.\n\nElection and oath\n\nOn February 9, 1861, the provisional congress at Montgomery elected Jefferson Davis president and Alexander H. Stephens vice president. Stephens, who was a delegate to Congress from Georgia, was inaugurated on February 11. Davis was inaugurated on February 18 upon his arrival from Mississippi, where he had gone upon his resignation from the U.S. Senate. Davis and Stephens were elected on November 6, 1861, for six-years terms, as provided by the permanent constitution. The Capital had been moved in June 1861, to Richmond, and the inauguration took place at the statue of Washington, on the public square, on February 22, 1862.\n\nBefore Davis entered on the execution of his office as President of the Confederate States, he was constitutionally required to take the following oath or affirmation:\n\nCompensation\n\nIn 1861, the President of the Confederate States earned a $25,000 annual salary, along with an expense account, and a nontaxable travel account.  The President's Office was located on the second floor of the Custom House on Main Street, a structure which also housed the Cabinet Room and the State and Treasury Department. The City of Richmond purchased the Brockenbrough house for presentation to the Confederate government for use as an executive mansion. Davis declined to accept the gift, but the mansion was leased for his use. Referred to as the \"White House of the Confederacy\" or the \"Grey House,\" the mansion was used by President Davis throughout the existence of his presidency. Later it became a repository for documents, relics, and pictures, and in 1896 it was redesignated the Confederate Museum.\n\nPost-presidency\n\nLate on the evening of April 2, 1865, President Davis, his aides, and members of the Cabinet, except Secretary of War Breckinridge, departed from Richmond on the Richmond and Danville Railroad. The Cabinet stayed at Danville, 140 mi miles southwest of Richmond, until April 10, when, hearing of Lee's surrender, it continued farther south. At Greensboro, North Carolina, on April 12 the Cabinet met with Generals Johnston and Beauregard and discussed surrender of Johnston's army to General Sherman. As the railroad south of Greensboro had been destroyed, the flight from that location was on horseback and in ambulances, wagons, and carriages. The last Cabinet meetings took place at Charlotte, on April 24, and 26, and on May 4; when Davis left Washington, Georgia, the party consisted only of his aides and Postmaster General Reagan. Elements of the United States Cavalry captured Davis and his companions at an encampment near Irwinville, May 10, 1865.\n\nJefferson Davis was imprisoned at Fort Monroe, Virginia, until his release on bail on May 13, 1867. During his confinement the United States Government prepared to bring him to trial for treason and for complicity in the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln. He could not be tried in Virginia until the Federal court was reestablished there, but by the time the circuit judges were prepared in May 1867 the United States Government decided the outcome of a trial before a local jury was far too uncertain and dropped the proceedings. In November 1868 Davis was brought to trial under a new indictment, but the judges disagreed and the case was referred to the Supreme Court. President Johnson issued a general amnesty in December 1868, and the Supreme Court entered a nolle prosequi, thus freeing Davis.\nQuestion:\nWho was the president of the Confederate States of America following its formation in 1861?\nAnswer:\nJefferson Davies\nPassage:\nLondon 2012: Team GB wins first Olympic medals - BBC News\nLondon 2012: Team GB wins first Olympic medals - BBC News\nBBC News\nLondon 2012: Team GB wins first Olympic medals\n29 July 2012\nRead more about sharing.\nClose share panel\nImage caption Rebecca Adlington (l) won Team GB's second medal on Sunday, while some events still had empty seats and others were disrupted by rain\nTeam GB has won its first London 2012 medals, with cyclist Lizzie Armitstead taking silver in the women's road race.\nSwimmer Rebecca Adlington has taken bronze in the final of the 400m freestyle.\nLondon 2012 chairman Lord Coe insisted Olympics venues were \"stuffed\" with sports fans, after a row about empty seats on Saturday.\nHowever, on Sunday empty seats could be seen at several sports, including basketball, volleyball and tennis.\nArmitstead, 23, from Otley near Leeds, was beaten to the gold at the end of the 140-kilometre race by Holland's Marianne Vos in a sprint finish on The Mall.\nShe said: \"I'm really, really happy.

Bomarsund had not been completed (only two towers of the planned twelve subsidiary towers had been completed). When the war broke out the fortress remained vulnerable especially against forces attacking over land. Designers of the fortress had also assumed that narrow sea passages near the fortress would not be passable for large naval ships; while this assumption had held true during the time of sailing ships, it was possible for steam powered ships to reach weakly defended sections of the fortress.\n\nFirst battle \n\nOn 21 June 1854, three British ships bombarded the Bomarsund fortress. Artillery from the shore, however, responded and, while both sides suffered some damage, the casualties were light. The first battle was indecisive. During the battle, Charles Davis Lucas tossed overboard a shell which had landed on board. The shell exploded before it reached water. For saving his ship he was the first man to be awarded the Victoria Cross. \n\nSecond battle \n\nWhile the first battle had been a brief clash and artillery duel, the second battle was a different affair. By the end of July 1854, a British fleet of 25 ships had surrounded the fortress and only waited for the French ground troops to arrive. Both defender and attacker had acknowledged that the fort could not be defeated by naval forces alone and made preparations accordingly, Russian forces destroyed the surrounding countryside in an effort to force British and French forces break away from the assumed siege.\n\nLanding on 8 August, the British troops established a battery of three 32-pounder guns on a hill, the French establishing several batteries. \nOn 13 August 1854, the French artillery opened fire on a tower and by the end of the day were in a position that while artillery suppressed the defenders of subsidiary tower of Br\u00e4nnklint, French infantry assaulted it.  Defenders found their position to be hopeless and withdrew the bulk of their forces to the main fort leaving only small detachment behind to supervise demolition of the tower. While French troops managed to capture the tower before it was demolished, it did not save the tower since the Russian artillery now opened fire at the captured tower and on 15 August 1854 scored a hit to the gunpowder magazines. The resulting explosion demolished the tower.\n\nThe second tower, Notvik, was also lost on 15 August 1854 after British guns opened fire from their hill opposite to the tower. After eight hours of bombardment they managed to create a gaping hole to the fort. After most of the guns had been lost commandant of the tower surrendered to the British and French forces.\n\nThe bombardment of the main fortress started late on 15 August 1854 with land based guns and the navy opening fire. With only a few guns capable of firing in the direction of the bombarding ships, the Russian forces hoped for the French and British forces to attack over land. However, after the bombardment continued into the 16 August without any indication of landings, it became apparent to the Russian commander that British and French intended to reduce the fortress with artillery fire. As the situation appeared hopeless, Bomarsund surrendered on 16 August 1854.\n\nThe early surrender came as a surprise of the French and British. 2,000 men laid down their arms and became prisoners.\n\nAftermath \n\nAfter the surrender, French and British forces demolished the fortress. British engineers remained until mid-September to ensure it could not be easily rebuilt.\n\nThree hundred Finnish grenadiers defending the fortress were captured and imprisoned in Lewes in the United Kingdom.  They were later allowed to return to Finland, and they returned with a song telling about their battles and imprisonment, called the War of \u00c5land (\"Finnish: Oolannin sota, Swedish: \"Det \u00c5l\u00e4ndska kriget). The Russian Memorial was erected in Lewes in 1877 to honour those who died in captivity.\n\nIn the Treaty of Paris 1856, the entire \u00c5land Islands were demilitarized, which is a status that has been preserved until this day.\n\nThe Bomarsund Bridge connects Bomarsund to the Pr\u00e4st\u00f6 island.\n\nVictoria Cross recipients \n\nIn addition to Charles Davis Lucas several other Victoria Crosses were awarded in the Baltic Theater during the Crimean War.\n\nOther VC recipients for action in the Baltic Sea:\n* John Bythesea - 1854; \u00c5land Islands\n* William Johnstone - 1854; \u00c5land Islands\n* George Ingouville - 1855; Fort of Viborg\n* George Dare Dowell - 1855; Fort of Viborg\n\nTrivia \n\n*A coal mine in Northumberland was named after the battle; the neighboring village still carries the name Bomarsund.\n*In 2007 Orlando Gough's opera The Finnish Prisoner which tells about the events of 1854 had its premiere performance in Lewes.\nQuestion:\nThe Battle of Bomarsund of 1854 was a battle that took place during which war?\nAnswer:\nRusso-Turkish War, 1853-56\nPassage:\nCape Farewell, Greenland\nCape Farewell (;  )  is a headland on the southern shore of Egger Island, Nunap Isua Archipelago, Greenland.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nSugar plum\nA sugar plum is a piece of drag\u00e9e  or hard candy made of hardened sugar in a small round or oval shape. \n\n\"Plum\" in the name of this confection does not mean plum in the sense of the fruit of the same name, but referred to small size and spherical or oval shape. According to The Atlantic Monthly, traditional sugar plums contained no fruit, but were  instead hardened sugar balls. According to the Huffington Post, these hardened sugar balls were comfits, and often surrounded a seed, nut, or spice. \n\nHistory\n\nThe term sugar plum came into general usage in the 1600s. At that time, adding layers of sweet which give sugar plums and comfits their hard shell was done through a slow and labour-intensive process called panning. Until the mechanization of the process, it often took several days, and thus the sugar plum was largely a luxury product. In fact, in the 18th century the word plum became British slang for a large pile of money  or a bribe.  However, by the 1860s manufacturers were using steam heat and mechanized rotating pans, and it was then available for mass consumption.\n\nToday, some candy manufacturers have taken \"sugar plum\" literally, creating plum-flavored, plum-shaped candies and marketing them as \"sugar plum candy\". \n\nIn one non-traditional 21st-century take-off on the word \"sugar plum\", in a recipe for home cooks, dried fruit is chopped fine and combined with chopped almonds, honey, and aromatic spices, such as anise seed, fennel seed, caraway seeds, and cardamom. This mixture is rolled into balls, then coated in sugar or shredded coconut. \n\nIn popular culture\n\nSugar plums are widely associated with Christmas, through cultural phenomena such as the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker (Composed by Tchaikovsky, 1892), as well as the line \"Visions of sugar plums danced in their heads,\" from Clement C. Moore's poem A Visit from St. Nicholas (1823), better known as \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas.\"\n\nIn the children's board game Candy Land the character Plumpy, a gingerbread troll, wore a sugar plum around his neck. Receiving the Plumpy card meant the player had to undo most of their progress, which could lead to great frustration and often prolonged the game.

Perry was born in Santa Barbara, California, and raised by Christian pastor parents; she grew up listening to only gospel music and sang in church as a child. After earning a GED during her freshman year of high school, she began to pursue a music career. She released a self-titled gospel album in 2001 as Katy Hudson which failed with the closing of its record label that year. She recorded an album with production team The Matrix and completed most of a solo album from 2004\u20132005, neither of which were released.\nAfter signing on with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry and released her first Internet single, \"Ur So Gay\", that November, which garnered attention but did not chart. She rose to fame with her second single \"I Kissed a Girl\" in 2008, which topped international charts. Perry's first mainstream album, One of the Boys, followed later that year and was eventually announced to be the thirty-third best selling album of 2008 worldwide. It was accredited platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America; \"I Kissed a Girl\" and her second single \"Hot n Cold\" both received multi-platinum certifications. Perry was ranked the 97th Artist of the 2000\u201310 decade by Billboard. She became known for wearing unconventional style of dress, often combining bold colors and vintage fashion. Her next album, Teenage Dream, was released on August 24, 2010 in the United States.\nPerry had a long relationship with Travis McCoy; she is currently engaged to Russell Brand.\nKaty Perry was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson in Santa Barbara, California. The second child of two pastors, she has an older sister and younger brother.Her Evangelical mother, Mary Hudson (n\u00e9e Perry), grew up in Southern California and had \"a tempestuous first marriage in Zimbabwe.\"Her father, Keith Hudson, was a West Coast scenester in the 1960s.Perry's maternal aunt and uncle were screenwriter Eleanor Perry and director Frank Perry, through whom she is also related to Charles M. Schwab, the founder of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Perry is of Portuguese and German ancestry on her mother's side.\nPerry was incorporated into her parents' ministry; she sang in their church from ages 9 to 17. She grew up listening to gospel music and was not allowed to listen to what her mother called secular music. Perry attended Christian schools and camps. As a child, Perry learned how to dance in a recreation building in Santa Barbara. She was taught by seasoned dancers and began with swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug. She took her GED after her freshman year of high school and decided to leave school to pursue a career in music. Perry initially started singing \"because I was at that point in my childhood where I was copycatting my sister and everything she did.\"Her sister practiced with cassette tapes, and Perry took the tapes herself when her sister was not around. She rehearsed the songs and performed it to her parents, who suggested she should take voice lessons. She grabbed the opportunity and began taking lessons at age nine to 16. She enrolled in at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, and studied Italian opera for a short time.\nPerry dated Gym Class Heroes frontman Travis McCoy, whom she met in a recording studio in New York, on and off for several years. After more than a year of friendship and casual dating, they became serious with their relationship right before they embarked into the 2008 Warped Tour. Perry and McCoy broke up in December 2008. The two began dating again in early 2009 and broke up again a few months later. Perry is now engaged to British comedian Russell Brand after he proposed in December 2009. In a YouTube interview, she said Brand would be a \"perfect\" father.\nDiscography:\n* One of the Boys (2008)\n* Teenage Dream (2010)\nQuestion:\nBritish comedians Jo, Katy and Russell all share which surname?\nAnswer:\nMarketing brand\nPassage:\nCAFOD\nThe Catholic Agency For Overseas Development (CAFOD), previously known as the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development, is the Catholic aid agency for England and Wales. It is an international aid agency working to alleviate poverty and suffering in developing countries. It is funded by the Catholic community in England and Wales, the British Government and the general public by donations.\n\nCAFOD was founded in 1962. CAFOD's aims are to promote long-term development; respond to emergencies; raise public awareness of the causes of poverty; speak out on behalf of poor communities; and promote social justice in witness to Christian faith and gospel values. It is also involved in short-term relief. It is a sponsor of the new [http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php Las Casas Institute] at Blackfriars Hall, University of Oxford.\n\nCAFOD is an agency of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales and part of the Caritas International Federation which operates in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. CAFOD is a member of the DEC Disasters Emergency Committee and the British Overseas Aid Group. In 2010/11 it raised \u00a369 million and employed 369 staff.\n\nHistory\n\nCAFOD was born when volunteer members of the National Board of Catholic Women organised the first Family Fast Day on Friday, March 11, 1960. In 1962 CAFOD was officially registered as a public charity. In 1965 CAFOD became a member of Caritas Internationalis and in 1969 joined the CIDSE, a collection of European and North American Catholic Charities. In 1979 its first campaign was launched in the Philippines and they kept growing. Caritas in 1987 asked CAFOD to lead and lobby for a worldwide programme on HIV and Aids. In 1993 its first international office was formed in CAFOD Albania. In 1998 offices were formed in Zimbabwe and Kenya and one year later its Kosovo Appeal raised \u00a38 million. In 2005 the MakePovertyHistory rally in Edinburgh was attended by 249000 people and in 2012, on the same year as the Queens Diamond Jubilee, CAFOD celebrated its 50th Anniversary.\n\nInternational programmes\n\nCAFOD has offices in Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa & Goma), Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan and Zimbabwe. CAFOD also has staff based with partners in Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.\nQuestion:\nIn the abbrevation CAFOD - for what does the 'O' stand?\nAnswer:\nOverseas\nPassage:\nWarschauer Kniefall\nKniefall von Warschau (German for \"Warsaw Genuflection\") refers to a gesture of humility and penance by German Chancellor Willy Brandt towards the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. \n\nIncident\n\nThe event took place on December 7, 1970, in what was then the Communist People's Republic of Poland during a visit to a monument to the Nazi-era Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. After laying down a wreath, Brandt, very surprisingly, and to all appearances spontaneously, knelt. He remained silently in that position for a short time, surrounded by a large group of dignitaries and press photographers.\n\nBrandt had actively resisted the early Nazi regime, and had spent most of the time of Hitler's reign in exile. The occasion of Brandt's visit to Poland at the time was the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and the People's Republic of Poland, guaranteeing German acceptance of the new borders of Poland. The treaty was one of the Brandt-initiated policy steps (the 'Ostpolitik') to ease tensions between West and East during the Cold War.\n\nReaction\n\nIn Germany\n\nOn the same day, Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, which acknowledged the Oder-Neisse-Line as the final German border with Poland. Both actions attracted controversy within Germany, as did Ostpolitik in general, favored only by a narrow majority in public opinion. It was disputed within his own party, whose voters had included a significant proportion of expellees from the formerly German territories in Poland, most whom then went to the conservative parties.\n\nAccording to a Der Spiegel survey of the time, 48% of all West Germans thought the \"Kniefall\" was excessive, 41% said it was appropriate and 11% had no opinion.  The Kniefall was a symbolic action the opposition tried to use against Brandt, as in a Constructive Vote of No Confidence in April 1972, which Brandt won by only two votes. Brandt's landslide win in the next elections in late 1972 was also due to the growing view among voters that Brandt's Ostpolitik\u2014symbolized by the Kniefall\u2014and his reformist domestic policies were helping to boost Germany's international reputation and should be supported. The SPD won its best federal election result ever.\n\nInternationally\n\nWhile at the time, positive reactions may have been limited, his show of humility was a small but vital step in bridging the gaps World War II had left between Germany and Eastern Europe. In historical terms, Brandt gained much renown for this act, and it is thought to be one of the reasons he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.\n\nA monument to Willy Brandt was unveiled on 6 December 2000, in Willy Brandt Square in Warsaw (near the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument) on the eve of the 30th anniversary of his famous gesture.\n\nBrandt's memories\n\nBrandt was repeatedly interviewed about the genuflection and about his motives. He later noted that:\n\n(German original) \"Unter der Last der j\u00fcngsten Geschichte tat ich, was Menschen tun, wenn die Worte versagen. So gedachte ich Millionen Ermordeter.\" \n\n(English translation) Under the weight of recent history, I did what people do when words fail them. In this way I commemorated millions of murdered people.\nQuestion:\nKniefall von Warschau (German for 'Warsaw Genuflection') is a 1970 incident involving which European statesman who paid homage to WWII's Warsaw Ghetto Uprising during his visit to the city?\nAnswer:\nWilly Brandt\nPassage:\nGillespie Road\nGillespie Road is a road in Highbury, north London, running east-west along the north side of the Arsenal Stadium, previously home of Arsenal Football Club. Arsenal tube station was originally named Gillespie Road, before being given its current name in 1932 following pressure from the club. At the time of Arsenal's move to the nearby Emirates Stadium in July 2006, an email was circulated by  supporters of  rival club Tottenham Hotspur inviting petitions to the Mayor of London, asking him to give the station back its original name [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?viewDETAILS&grid\n&xml=/sport/2006/01/14/sfndry14.xml] which proved unsuccessful.

The title is an invention of the Victorian public and press, dating from its exhibition in the opening display at the Bethnal Green Museum in 1872\u201375, just after its arrival in England, after which it was regularly reproduced as a print, and became among of the best known old master paintings in Britain. The unknown subject is in fact not laughing, but can be said to have an enigmatic smile, much amplified by his upturned moustache.\n\nDescription\n\nThe portrait measures 83 \u00d7 67.3 cm (32.7 \u00d7 26.5 in) and is inscribed at top right \"\u00c6'TA SV\u00c6 26/A\u00b01624\", which expands to \"aetatis suae 26, anno 1624\" in Latin and means that the portrait was painted when the sitter was 26 and in the year 1624.   The identity of the man was unknown for centuries, and though the recorded 19th century titles in Dutch, English and French mostly suggest a military man, or at least an officer in one of the part-time militia companies that were often the subjects of group portraits, including some by Hals and later Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642), in fact he was as likely to be a wealthy civilian and Pieter Biesboer has identified him as Tieleman Roosterman.  The composition is lively and spontaneous, and despite the apparent labour involved in the gorgeous, and very expensive, silk costume, close inspection reveals long, quick brush strokes. The turning pose and low viewpoint are found in other portraits by Hals and here allow emphasis on the embroidered sleeve and lace cuff.  There are many emblems in the embroidery: signifying \"the pleasures and pains of love\" are \"bees, arrows, flaming cornucopiae, lovers' knots and tongues of fire\", while an obelisk or pyramid signifies strength and Mercury's cap and caduceus fortune. \n\nIn general, commissioned portraits such as this rarely showed adults smiling until the late 18th century, though smiling is often seen in tronies and figures in genre painting.  But Hals is an exception to the general rule and often showed sitters with broader smiles than here, and in informal poses that bring an impression of movement and spontaneity to his work. \n\nThe effect of the eyes appearing to follow the viewer from every angle is a result of the subject being depicted as looking directly forward, toward the artist's point of view, combined with being a static two dimensional representation of this from whichever angle the painting itself is viewed. \n\nHistory\n\nThe painting's provenance only goes back to a sale in The Hague in 1770; after further Dutch sales it was bought by the Franco-Swiss banker and collector the Comte de Pourtal\u00e8s-Gorgier in 1822.  After his death the painting was acquired at the auction of his collection in Paris in 1865 by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, who outbid Baron James de Rothschild at more than six times the sales estimate.  It was in Hertford's Paris home in 1871, listed as portrait d'un homme (\"portrait of a man\"), and then brought to London, probably for the purpose of exhibiting it in a large and long loan exhibition of old master paintings at Bethnal Green, which was deliberately sited away from the West End of London to attract the working classes.  The exhibition was a huge success and A Cavalier (the catalogue title) a particular hit with both public and the critics; it played a considerable part in raising the critical estimation of Hals in England.  By 1888, when it was again exhibited at the Royal Academy, it had become Laughing Cavalier, though a cleaning in the intervening period (in 1884) may have changed the effect.   The critic in the Athenaeum noted a brighter appearance, but also that \"The man smiles rather than laughs\".  Hertford's collection was bequeathed to his natural son Sir Richard Wallace Bt., whose widow donated it and his London house to the nation as the Wallace Collection.\n\nDerivatives\n\nThe Laughing Cavalier is used by McEwan's beer as its logo. It has been modified showing the Laughing Cavalier enjoying the beer. \n\nIn the Scarlet Pimpernel adventure series by Emma Orczy, The Laughing Cavalier is a prequel recounting the story of the supposed subject of the painting, who is an ancestor of her main hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy Blakeney.\n\nThe \"eyes following you round the room\" trope has long been a stand-by in British comedy, used by Pete and Dud in The Art Gallery,  among many others, sometimes in the form of a portrait with cut-away eyes that can be used as a peephole.\nQuestion:\nWho painted the famous picture the Laughing Cavalier?\nAnswer:\nFrans Hals\nPassage:\nCarl Douglas\nCarlton George Douglas (born 10 May 1942), also known by his stage name Carl Douglas, is a Jamaican recording artist. Douglas rose to prominence after releasing his single \"Kung Fu Fighting\".\n\nEarly life\n\nCarlton George Douglas was born on 10 May 1942 in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nCareer\n\nDouglas' career was based in the United Kingdom, where his single \"Kung Fu Fighting\" ranked number one in both the U.K. Singles Chart and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1974. The single sold 11 million copies worldwide,   making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. The single was later certified gold by the RIAA on 27 November 1974. \n\nThe single, which is a homage to martial arts films, has overshadowed the rest of Douglas' career; resulting in his appearance on cover versions of the single. In the United States, Douglas was considered a \"one-hit wonder\" since he was only known for \"Kung Fu Fighting\". However, in the United Kingdom, he has two other singles that made it into the \"Top 40\", which were \"Dance the Kung Fu\", which peaked at number 35 in the charts; and \"Run Back\", which peaked at number 25.\n\nDouglas was once managed by Eric Woolfson,  who later became the primary songwriter behind \"The Alan Parsons Project\".\n\nIn 1998, a re-recording of \"Kung Fu Fighting\", performed by British dance act Bus Stop and which featured Douglas's vocals, peaked at number 8 in the \"UK Singles Chart\". \n\nThe single \"Dance The Kung Fu\", was sampled on \"Cuda nie widy\" from 2001 album Nibylandia, and later by DJ Premier on his 2007 remix of Nike's 25th Air Force One anniversary single \"Classic (Better Than I've Ever Been)\", featuring Kanye West, Nas, KRS-One and Rakim.

The Coptic Christians killed in this incident were considered martyrs of the Coptic Orthodox Church by Pope Shenouda III.\n\nKosheh\n\nKosheh is located on the east bank of the Nile in Sohag governorate, a few miles east of Balyana. The population of Kosheh is about 35,000 and 70% of the village are Christian Copts. Kosheh is the trading center for a number of villages in the area. There is little farmland in Kosheh; it serves rather as the shopping nexus for the rural areas around it. Most of the shopkeepers are Copts, while most of the farmers in the surrounding villages are Muslims from Arab tribes.  \n\nFirst Kosheh Massacre\n\nTensions between Christians and Muslims had started a few years earlier, in August 1998, in what is known as the First Kosheh Massacre. In this incident, two Copts were murdered by Muslims. The Muslims in turn were allegedly seeking revenge for the \u201cpoisoning\u201d of a brother who had actually died of natural causes. In response, the Egyptian police responded by rounding up about 1,200 Christians for investigation into the murder. When Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, criticised the arrests, he was himself arrested with two of his priests, and was charged with inciting strife and damaging national unity between Christians and Muslims.\n\nIn October 1998, an article by Christina Lamb in London\u2019s Daily Telegraph reported that some of the arrested Copts had undergone mock crucifixions and that Metropolitan Wissa faced possible execution. The Egyptian government was outraged at the negative publicity, and arrested the head of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), whom it accused of having given the story to the Daily Telegraph. The head of the EOHR and Metropolitan Wissa were eventually released. Although the government promised to punish any police who had acted improperly, some of the police officers involved in the human rights violations against the Copts in el-Kosheh were in fact promoted. Thus, the First Kosheh Massacre turned into an international incident. As a result, Coptic groups in the West began to push for the US Congress to include Egypt among nations that discriminate against Christians.\n\nSecond Kosheh Massacre\n\nThe Second Kosheh Massacre took place about one year later, on Friday 31 December 1999. The incidence stemmed from a quarrel between a Christian merchant and a Muslim customer. The misunderstanding strained Muslim-Christian relations in the community. Relatives of the Muslim customer targeted Christian-owned shops and homes, which were looted, destroyed, and burned. Initially, the police was able to contain the situation. However, two days later on Sunday 2 January 2000, riots spread violence into neighbouring villages and lead to the murders of 20 Christians. One Muslim was also accidentally shot dead by a fellow Muslim.   More than 40 people were injured in the two-day incident. 260 shops, houses and kiosks were also deliberately burnt or damaged. Most of the killings took place in the outskirts of el-Kosheh, especially in the agriculture fields. This event was one of Egypt's bloodiest massacres.\n\nThe local authorities during the incident did little to control the situation. There were some cases where these officers participated in the killings.\nFollowing the massacre, the entire Coptic community felt that these events epitomised the criminal negligence of the Egyptian administration, represented in its police force, when it comes to protecting Coptic lives and property. Since local police units are often drawn from the local community, local feuds including Muslim resentment of Christian families can very well color police behaviour.\n\nOn 1 December 2000, a criminal court in Egypt's Sohag governorate released without bail all 89 defendants charged in the New Year's massacre in el-Kosheh. It was unprecedented in Egypt that several dozen murder suspects would be released without bail a month before their verdict was determined. All suspects that were initially arrested in connection to this massacre were eventually acquitted had their charges dropped. The only person convicted in the massacre was a Muslim charged with accidental killing of another Muslim, and sentenced to 13 years in prison.  No one was ever convicted for the murder of the 21 Christian victims. This led to outrage in the Coptic community who felt that these suspects should be in custody. The Pope of Alexandria Shenouda III rejected the verdict openly, and told reporters \"We want to challenge this ruling. We don't accept it.\" Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, called the ruling \"A shame that defames the reputation of Egypt and an invitation for more violence\". Egypt's Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahid appealed the acquittal verdict of the defendants, stating that \"there is no doubt that 21 people were killed, and the killers must be brought to justice,\" \"We never imagined that they would release the killers, but this is Egypt\" a Copt from el-Kosheh admitted by telephone.\n\nSix days following the acquittal of the defendants, the homes of four Christian families in el-Kosheh were set to fire and completely destroyed. One of the homeowners who reported the arson to the Egyptian police was tortured and forced to sign a statement prepared by a public prosecutor charging him with perpetrating the whole incident. He was subsequently forced to post bail for his own release.\nQuestion:\nThe Kosheh Massacre took place in which African country in 2000?\nAnswer:\nEGY\nPassage:\nDolomite\nDolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate, ideally CaMg(CO3)2. The word dolomite is also used to describe the sedimentary carbonate rock, which is composed predominantly of the mineral dolomite (also known as dolostone).\n\nHistory\n\nMost probably the mineral dolomite was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1768.  In 1778, it was described by the Austrian naturalist Belsazar Hacquet as the \"stinking stone\" (, ).   In 1791, it was described as a rock by the French naturalist and geologist D\u00e9odat Gratet de Dolomieu (1750\u20131801), first in buildings of the old city of Rome, and later as samples collected in what is now known as the Dolomite Alps of northern Italy. Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure first named the mineral (after Dolomieu) in March 1792.  Hacquet and Dolomieu met in Laibach (Ljubljana) in 1784,  which may have contributed to Dolomieu's work.\n\nProperties\n\nThe mineral dolomite crystallizes in the trigonal-rhombohedral system. It forms white, tan, gray, or pink crystals. Dolomite is a double carbonate, having an alternating structural arrangement of calcium and magnesium ions. It does not rapidly dissolve or effervesce (fizz) in dilute hydrochloric acid as calcite does. Crystal twinning is common.\n\nSolid solution exists between dolomite, the iron-dominant ankerite and the manganese-dominant kutnohorite.Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S. Hurlbut Jr., Manual of Mineralogy, Wiley, 20th ed., p. 339-340 ISBN 0-471-80580-7 Small amounts of iron in the structure give the crystals a yellow to brown tint. Manganese substitutes in the structure also up to about three percent MnO. A high manganese content gives the crystals a rosy pink color. Lead, zinc, and cobalt also substitute in the structure for magnesium. The mineral dolomite is closely related to huntite Mg3Ca(CO3)4.\n\nBecause dolomite can be dissolved by slightly acidic water, areas of dolomite are important as aquifers and contribute to karst terrain formation. \n\nFormation\n\nModern dolomite formation has been found to occur under anaerobic conditions in supersaturated saline lagoons along the Rio de Janeiro coast of Brazil, namely, Lagoa Vermelha and Brejo do Espinho.  It is often thought that dolomite will develop only with the help of sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. Desulfovibrio brasiliensis).  However, low-temperature dolomite may occur in natural environments rich in organic matter and microbial cell surfaces. This occurs as a result of magnesium complexation by carboxyl groups associated with organic matter. \n\nVast deposits of dolomite are present in the geological record, but the mineral is relatively rare in modern environments. Reproducible, inorganic low-temperature syntheses of dolomite and magnesite were published for the first time in 1999. Those laboratory experiments showed how the initial precipitation of a metastable \"precursor\" (such as magnesium calcite) will change gradually into more and more of the stable phase (such as dolomite or magnesite) during periodical intervals of dissolution and re-precipitation. The general principle governing the course of this irreversible geochemical reaction has been coined \"breaking Ostwald's step rule\". \n\nThere is some evidence for a biogenic occurrence of dolomite. One example is that of the formation of dolomite in the urinary bladder of a Dalmatian dog, possibly as the result of an illness or infection. \n\nFormation of dolomite from solution and its link with biogenic dolomite\n\nIn 2015, it was experimentally discovered that the direct crystallization of dolomite can occur from solution at temperatures between 60\u2013220\u00a0\u00b0C. Dolomite forms through a three-stage process: 1) A nanoparticulate magnesium-deficient, amorphous calcium carbonate (Mg-ACC) forms; 2) After a temperature-dependent induction time, this Mg-ACC partially dehydrates and orders prior to its rapid (<5 min) crystallization to non-stoichiometric proto-dolomite (with a lower Mg/Ca ratio compared to dolomite). This occurs via the dissolution of Mg-ACC, followed by the secondary nucleation of proto-dolomite from solution. 3) Finally, the proto-dolomite crystallization proceeds via spherulitic growth that follows a growth front nucleation mechanism with a de novo and continuous formation of nanocrystalline proto-dolomite subunits that form spherical aggregates. In stage three of the reaction, the proto-dolomite transforms to highly crystalline and stoichiometric dolomite on a much longer timescale (hours to days), via an Ostwald-ripening mechanism. Such a three-stage crystallization can explain microbially induced proto-dolomites observed in modern hypersaline settings and may also be the route by which the Cryogenian cap dolomite deposits of the Neoproterozoic formed. \n\nUses\n\nDolomite is used as an ornamental stone, a concrete aggregate, and a source of magnesium oxide, as well as in the Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock, and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. Where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly, dolomite is sometimes used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel. Large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass.\n\nIn horticulture, dolomite and dolomitic limestone are added to soils and soilless potting mixes as a pH buffer and as a magnesium source. Home and container gardening are common examples of this use.\n\nDolomite is also used as the substrate in marine (saltwater) aquariums to help buffer changes in pH of the water.\n\nCalcined dolomite is also used as a catalyst for destruction of tar in the gasification of biomass at high temperature. \n\nParticle physics researchers like to build particle detectors under layers of dolomite to enable the detectors to detect the highest possible number of exotic particles. Because dolomite contains relatively minor quantities of radioactive materials, it can insulate against interference from cosmic rays without adding to background radiation levels. \n\nDolomite is a popular choice for motorcycle speedway tracks throughout Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDolomite is used in the ceramic industry and in studio pottery as a glaze ingredient, contributing magnesium and calcium as glass melt fluxes.\nQuestion:\nDolomite is an ore of which metal?\nAnswer:\nC8H14MgO10\nPassage:\nFarringford House\nFarringford was the much loved home of Poet Laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, for forty years until his death in 1892. The main house dates from 1806 with gothic embellishments and extensions added from the 1830s. Of particular historical importance is the second library built by Lady Emily Tennyson in 1871 with a play room below connected by a turreted winding staircase. The grounds are laid to lawn, rose borders and informal planting. Evidence remains of Tennyson's planting schemes together with a section of the walled garden and wooden footpaths.\n\nThe house and grounds are currently undergoing a programme of restoration having been a hotel since it left the Tennyson family's ownership in the 1940s. The house is scheduled to open in 2016 as a study centre and will host group visits, writer's retreats, creative workshops, concerts and exhibitions. On the estate there are fourteen 4* self-catering cottages available all year round, a helicopter landing pad, a restaurant which caters to both guests and local residents, a 9-hole golf course, outdoor heated swimming pool, tennis court and children's play area. \n\nThe estate is located on Bedbury Lane, Freshwater Bay, on the Western tip of the Isle of Wight. Some of the surrounding houses, particularly those in Middleton at the start of Moons Hill are connected with the Farringford's history, once forming part of the estate. The houses at the end of Queens Road, the junction near the farm used to be stables where Fred Pontin's horses where kept.\n\nSouthern Vectis' Needles Breezer Open Top bus has a stop outside the Farringford and this is the only bus that goes down Bedbury Lane towards Alum Bay.\n\nTennyson wrote of Farringford:\n\nTennyson rented Farringford in 1853, and then bought it in 1856.  He found that there were too many starstruck tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to \"Aldworth\", a stately home on a hill known as Blackdown between Lurgashall and Fernhurst, about 2\u00a0km south of Haslemere in West Sussex in 1869. However, he returned to Farringford to spend the winters.\nQuestion:\nFarringford House on the Isle of Wight was the home of which poet?\nAnswer:\nA. tennyson\nPassage:\nOphidiophobia\nOphidiophobia or ophiophobia is a particular type of specific phobia, the abnormal fear of snakes. Fear of snakes is sometimes called by a more general term, herpetophobia, fear of reptiles and/or amphibians. The word comes from the Greek words \"ophis\" () which refers to snake and \"phobia\" () meaning fear. \n\nCare must also be taken to differentiate people who do not like snakes or fear them for their venom or the inherent danger involved. An  ophidiophobe would not only fear them when in live contact but also dreads to think about them or even see them on TV or in pictures. \n\nAbout a third of adult humans are ophidiophobic, making this the most common reported phobia.  Scientists have theorised that humans may have an innate reaction to snakes, which was vital for the survival of humankind as it allowed such dangerous threats to be identified immediately. \n\nFictional cases\n\n* Ophidiophobia is a characteristic of adventurer Indiana Jones.\nQuestion:\nOphidiophobia is an abnormal fear of what creatures?\nAnswer:\nSnkae\nPassage:\nNew Zealand is home to 3 million people and 60 million sheep\nNew Zealand is home to 3 million people and 60 million sheep\nStatistics NZ Home > Browse for statistics > Population > Population mythbusters > New Zealand is home to 3 million people and 60 million sheep\nNew Zealand is home to 3 million people and 60 million sheep\nSections on this page\nPopulation mythbusters\nIt\u2019s widely believed that New Zealand has 20 sheep for every person \u2013 information that adds weight to myriad sheep jokes. How accurate is this these days?\nTo begin with, we must find out how many people live in New Zealand. The population passed the 4 million mark in 2003. Our\u00a0 population clock put the event at precisely 5.30 pm on Thursday, 24 April. By 30 June 2015, the estimated resident population had reached 4.60 million people.\nNext, we must find out how many sheep we have. According to Statistics NZ's agricultural production statistics, we had an estimated\u00a029.5 million sheep at 30 June 2015.\nThis means that the sheep-to-person ratio has fallen\u00a0and contrary to popular belief there are actually about\u00a0six\u00a0sheep per person, not 20.\nConclusion\nThis myth is busted. The information is now out of date.\nHowever, it is still true that people in New Zealand are greatly outnumbered by sheep, and our sheep-to-person ratio is high relative to other countries. It\u2019s still twice as high as Australia's, for example, which currently has\u00a0fewer than three sheep per person. As with New Zealand, this is due to declining sheep numbers and a growing human population.\nNew Zealanders have also long been outnumbered by cattle, although not to the same extent as by sheep. There are currently 6.4 million dairy and 3.6 million beef cattle in New Zealand. While the cattle population is growing at a slower rate than the human population, there has been a notable shift in the make-up of the cattle population. In 1994, 43.2 percent of cattle were dairy cattle. By 2015, that proportion had increased to 64.0 percent.\nA bit of sheep history\nNew Zealand sheep numbers peaked in 1982, with a total of 70.3 million sheep. In the same year, 3.18 million people lived in New Zealand. This works out to 22 sheep per person.\nSheep numbers have gradually declined since the mid-1980s, due to factors such as depressed wool prices, droughts in the 1990s, and competition from other land-intensive farming activities (eg dairy and forestry). While sheep numbers stabilised and even grew slightly in the mid-2000s, numbers soon decreased again, reaching the low of\u00a029.5 million in 2015.\nSome sheep facts from\u00a0 An Encyclopedia of New Zealand for the historians among us:\nNew Zealand's first sheep were set ashore by Captain Cook in 1773.\nRapid sheep population growth in the 1850s and 1860s was due mostly to permanent immigration, rather than natural increase. In 1864 alone, 13,000 sheep arrived in Canterbury from Australia. Droughts meant that sheep could always be bought cheaply from Australia. Drought continues to affect Australian farmers and sheep numbers.\nThe first shipment of frozen lamb and mutton sailed to London from Port Chalmers on the Dunedin in 1882.\nFor your information\nQuestion:\nWhat country has about 4.5 million people, but 40 million sheep?\nAnswer:\nN Z\nPassage:\nSabatier\nSabatier is the maker's mark used by several kitchen knife manufacturers\u2014by itself it is not a registered brand name. The name Sabatier is considered to imply a high-quality knife produced by one of a number of manufacturers in the Thiers region of France using a fully forged process; the knives of some of these manufacturers are highly regarded. However, the name \"Sabatier\" came into use before intellectual property laws and is not protected; knives legally bearing the name range from high-quality knives made in France to cheap mass-produced products of poor quality from France and other countries; a registered logo or full name, or both, such as \"65 Sabatier Perrier\", is necessary to establish origin and quality.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe name originated in Thiers, France at the beginning of the 19th century. The area of Thiers has been associated with the cutlery industry since the Middle Ages.  With the advent of the industrial age manufacturers began to consolidate their crafts or trades by creating brand or trade marks.\n\nEarly controversy\n\nTwo separate families began using the name Sabatier to market their knives. The families do not appear to be related except by name and craft. Jean Sabatier of Le Moutier (lower Thiers) and Phillipe Sabatier of Bellevue (upper Thiers). There is much dispute who registered the trademark first with each citing evidence.\n\nBrand names\n\nThe use of the Sabatier name is an anomaly of \"branding\" because the name was used by many different companies before intellectual property or trademark laws were fully established in France. In order to distinguish between the various makers of Sabatier knives, manufacturers are required to include a second word or symbol along with SABATIER. Over the years many marks were registered. In 1979, after the sale of the Moutier Sabatier brands to Cuisinox, the various holders of the brands formed an association to protect the brand name.\n\n* SABATIER fr\u00e8res\n* K SABATIER\n* SABATIER PERRIER\n* 65 SABATIER\n* 62 SABATIER\n* France SABATIER Jeune K Garanti\n* SABATIER Jeune Garanti with a bunch of grapes\n* SABATIER Acier Fondu Garanti with a bunch of grapes\n* France SABATIER Acier Fondu couronne K Garanti\n* V\u00e9ritable SABATIER France\n* Professional SABATIER\n* SABATIER Professional\n* V SABATIER France\n* V SABATIER Acier Fondu Garanti\n* V SABATIER Extra Fin\n* SABATIER 689 Couronn\u00e9\n* SABATIER Couronn\u00e9\n* SABATIER 589 Couronn\u00e9\n* SABATIER Trompette\n* SABATIER Deg\n* SABATIER****\n* SabatieR\n* SABATIER Trumpet France\n* Sarry SABATIER\n* Le vrai SABATIER\n* Le seul SABATIER\n* L\u2019unique SABATIER 1\u00e8re qualit\u00e9\n* SABATIER with a stylised slicing disk\n* SABATIER Lion\n* SABATIER Diamant\n* SABATIER Elephant\n\nManufacturing process\n\nAmong the many Sabatier manufacturers in Thiers, France, most provide high quality cutlery using traditional forging techniques that were developed in the area in the early and mid-19th century. Most of these manufacturers use a \"fully forged\" technique and a hand shaping and sharpening process using local skilled labour.\n\nFully forged means that three of the four knife parts (blade, bolster, tang and handle) are forged from a single piece of steel. In this process, a single cylinder shaped steel billet is heated where the bolster will be, and squeezed from the ends to create a bulge. The entire piece is heated again and forged to the shape of the blade, bolster, and tang using forging dies in one operation. Afterward, a clipping tool is used to cut the forged piece to the rough shape of the knife. Finally, the handles are riveted on, and the final shaping and sharpening is done by hand. The alternative way to manufacture knives is stamping; forging has traditionally been considered superior, but from the late 20th century some knives of excellent quality have been produced by stamping.\n\nConfusion continues\n\nWhile there are many knife manufacturers using Sabatier as their brand, some Sabatier manufacturers are considered authentic, and some are not. Generally speaking among connoisseurs of fine cutlery, only knives manufactured in Thiers, France from well established manufacturers from the 19th century are considered \"genuine\" Sabatier knives.\n\nMany other manufacturers, both in France and elsewhere, use the Sabatier name on their knives; however, they are usually mass-produced, and of poor quality.  Neither words such as vrai or garanti, nor \"Made in France\", ensure a good knife.\n\nCompanies selling Sabatier knives\n\nSabatier brands have been sold on to many companies over the years. The following list is an attempt to link the present day owners to the brands.\n\nETS Sabatier A\u00een\u00e9 & Perrier\n\nSabatier A\u00een\u00e9 & Perrier claim to be the oldest Sabatier knife maker still in existence and operated by the descendants of Phillipe Sabatier of Bellevue, Thiers, France. They have operated for more than 150 years and have sold under the brand name [Sabatier-k] since 1834.

It is named after James Parkinson, who, in 1817, wrote a classic essay on \u201cshaking palsy\u201d a disease whose cause is still unknown.\n1. There is no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n2. The diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease increases with age, with the peak onset in the 70s and is more common in men by a ratio of 3:2\n3. Symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease do not occur until 80% of neurons in the substantia nigra are lost. The substantia nigra is located in the midbrain and controls voluntary movement, produces dopamine, and regulates moods.\u00a0 The dopamine cells begin to die therefore messages from the brain to the body are decreased and leave the person unable to control movements normally.\n4. The classic manifestations of Parkinson\u2019s disease often include tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia which are often called the triad.\nA. Tremor, often the first sign may be minimal initially therefore the patient is the only one who notices it. The tremor can affect handwriting and is described as \u201cpill rolling\u201d because the thumb and forefinger appear to move in a rotary fashion as if rolling a pill.\nB. Rigidity, the second sign, is the increased resistance to passive motion when the limbs are moved through their range of motion. The rigidity is caused by sustained muscle contraction and elicits a complaint of muscle soreness; feeling tired and achy; pain in the head, upper body, spine, or legs.\nC. Bradykinesia, the final sign of the triad is particularly evident in the loss of automatic movements. They include blinking of the eyelids, swinging of the arms while walking, swallowing of saliva, self expression with facial and hand movements, and minor movement of postural adjustment.\n5. \u00a0\u00a0Genetic factors associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease include 13 genes; environmental factors include exposures\nto chemicals such as carbon monoxide and manganese; and the use of illicit drugs such as amphetamine and methamphetamine can also cause Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n6. \u00a0Exercise can limit decreased mobility, such as muscle atrophy, contractures, and constipation. The American Parkinson Disease Association publishes booklets and videotapes that provide helpful exercises. A physical therapist or occupational therapist may be consulted to design a personal exercise program for the patient. Exercise will not halt the progress but will enhance the patient\u2019s functional ability.\n7. Diet is a major importance to patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease because malnutrition and\u00a0constipation can be serious consequences of inadequate nutrition. Patients should eat foods that are easily chewed and swallowed and should allow\nthemselves ample time for eating to avoid frustration and encourage independence. Patients are advised to limit their protein intake if they are on levodopa.\n8.\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s can be treated with drug therapy that aims at correcting an imbalance of neurotransmitters within the central nervous system.

According to The Atlantic Monthly, traditional sugar plums contained no fruit, but were  instead hardened sugar balls. According to the Huffington Post, these hardened sugar balls were comfits, and often surrounded a seed, nut, or spice. \n\nHistory\n\nThe term sugar plum came into general usage in the 1600s. At that time, adding layers of sweet which give sugar plums and comfits their hard shell was done through a slow and labour-intensive process called panning. Until the mechanization of the process, it often took several days, and thus the sugar plum was largely a luxury product. In fact, in the 18th century the word plum became British slang for a large pile of money  or a bribe.  However, by the 1860s manufacturers were using steam heat and mechanized rotating pans, and it was then available for mass consumption.\n\nToday, some candy manufacturers have taken \"sugar plum\" literally, creating plum-flavored, plum-shaped candies and marketing them as \"sugar plum candy\". \n\nIn one non-traditional 21st-century take-off on the word \"sugar plum\", in a recipe for home cooks, dried fruit is chopped fine and combined with chopped almonds, honey, and aromatic spices, such as anise seed, fennel seed, caraway seeds, and cardamom. This mixture is rolled into balls, then coated in sugar or shredded coconut. \n\nIn popular culture\n\nSugar plums are widely associated with Christmas, through cultural phenomena such as the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker (Composed by Tchaikovsky, 1892), as well as the line \"Visions of sugar plums danced in their heads,\" from Clement C. Moore's poem A Visit from St. Nicholas (1823), better known as \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas.\"\n\nIn the children's board game Candy Land the character Plumpy, a gingerbread troll, wore a sugar plum around his neck. Receiving the Plumpy card meant the player had to undo most of their progress, which could lead to great frustration and often prolonged the game. The Plumpy character was replaced in 2002 by Mama Gingertree.\n\nSugar plums have also gained widespread recognition through the poem \"The Sugar Plum Tree\" by Eugene Field. The poem begins \"Have you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree?

Perry was born in Santa Barbara, California, and raised by Christian pastor parents; she grew up listening to only gospel music and sang in church as a child. After earning a GED during her freshman year of high school, she began to pursue a music career. She released a self-titled gospel album in 2001 as Katy Hudson which failed with the closing of its record label that year. She recorded an album with production team The Matrix and completed most of a solo album from 2004\u20132005, neither of which were released.\nAfter signing on with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry and released her first Internet single, \"Ur So Gay\", that November, which garnered attention but did not chart. She rose to fame with her second single \"I Kissed a Girl\" in 2008, which topped international charts. Perry's first mainstream album, One of the Boys, followed later that year and was eventually announced to be the thirty-third best selling album of 2008 worldwide. It was accredited platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America; \"I Kissed a Girl\" and her second single \"Hot n Cold\" both received multi-platinum certifications. Perry was ranked the 97th Artist of the 2000\u201310 decade by Billboard. She became known for wearing unconventional style of dress, often combining bold colors and vintage fashion. Her next album, Teenage Dream, was released on August 24, 2010 in the United States.\nPerry had a long relationship with Travis McCoy; she is currently engaged to Russell Brand.\nKaty Perry was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson in Santa Barbara, California. The second child of two pastors, she has an older sister and younger brother.Her Evangelical mother, Mary Hudson (n\u00e9e Perry), grew up in Southern California and had \"a tempestuous first marriage in Zimbabwe.\"Her father, Keith Hudson, was a West Coast scenester in the 1960s.Perry's maternal aunt and uncle were screenwriter Eleanor Perry and director Frank Perry, through whom she is also related to Charles M. Schwab, the founder of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Perry is of Portuguese and German ancestry on her mother's side.\nPerry was incorporated into her parents' ministry; she sang in their church from ages 9 to 17. She grew up listening to gospel music and was not allowed to listen to what her mother called secular music. Perry attended Christian schools and camps. As a child, Perry learned how to dance in a recreation building in Santa Barbara. She was taught by seasoned dancers and began with swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug. She took her GED after her freshman year of high school and decided to leave school to pursue a career in music. Perry initially started singing \"because I was at that point in my childhood where I was copycatting my sister and everything she did.\"Her sister practiced with cassette tapes, and Perry took the tapes herself when her sister was not around. She rehearsed the songs and performed it to her parents, who suggested she should take voice lessons. She grabbed the opportunity and began taking lessons at age nine to 16. She enrolled in at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, and studied Italian opera for a short time.\nPerry dated Gym Class Heroes frontman Travis McCoy, whom she met in a recording studio in New York, on and off for several years. After more than a year of friendship and casual dating, they became serious with their relationship right before they embarked into the 2008 Warped Tour. Perry and McCoy broke up in December 2008. The two began dating again in early 2009 and broke up again a few months later. Perry is now engaged to British comedian Russell Brand after he proposed in December 2009. In a YouTube interview, she said Brand would be a \"perfect\" father.\nDiscography:\n* One of the Boys (2008)\n* Teenage Dream (2010)\nQuestion:\nBritish comedians Jo, Katy and Russell all share which surname?\nAnswer:\nMarketing brand\nPassage:\nCAFOD\nThe Catholic Agency For Overseas Development (CAFOD), previously known as the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development, is the Catholic aid agency for England and Wales. It is an international aid agency working to alleviate poverty and suffering in developing countries. It is funded by the Catholic community in England and Wales, the British Government and the general public by donations.\n\nCAFOD was founded in 1962. CAFOD's aims are to promote long-term development; respond to emergencies; raise public awareness of the causes of poverty; speak out on behalf of poor communities; and promote social justice in witness to Christian faith and gospel values. It is also involved in short-term relief. It is a sponsor of the new [http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php Las Casas Institute] at Blackfriars Hall, University of Oxford.\n\nCAFOD is an agency of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales and part of the Caritas International Federation which operates in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. CAFOD is a member of the DEC Disasters Emergency Committee and the British Overseas Aid Group. In 2010/11 it raised \u00a369 million and employed 369 staff.\n\nHistory\n\nCAFOD was born when volunteer members of the National Board of Catholic Women organised the first Family Fast Day on Friday, March 11, 1960. In 1962 CAFOD was officially registered as a public charity. In 1965 CAFOD became a member of Caritas Internationalis and in 1969 joined the CIDSE, a collection of European and North American Catholic Charities. In 1979 its first campaign was launched in the Philippines and they kept growing. Caritas in 1987 asked CAFOD to lead and lobby for a worldwide programme on HIV and Aids. In 1993 its first international office was formed in CAFOD Albania. In 1998 offices were formed in Zimbabwe and Kenya and one year later its Kosovo Appeal raised \u00a38 million. In 2005 the MakePovertyHistory rally in Edinburgh was attended by 249000 people and in 2012, on the same year as the Queens Diamond Jubilee, CAFOD celebrated its 50th Anniversary.\n\nInternational programmes\n\nCAFOD has offices in Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa & Goma), Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan and Zimbabwe. CAFOD also has staff based with partners in Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.\nQuestion:\nIn the abbrevation CAFOD - for what does the 'O' stand?\nAnswer:\nOverseas\nPassage:\nWarschauer Kniefall\nKniefall von Warschau (German for \"Warsaw Genuflection\") refers to a gesture of humility and penance by German Chancellor Willy Brandt towards the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. \n\nIncident\n\nThe event took place on December 7, 1970, in what was then the Communist People's Republic of Poland during a visit to a monument to the Nazi-era Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. After laying down a wreath, Brandt, very surprisingly, and to all appearances spontaneously, knelt. He remained silently in that position for a short time, surrounded by a large group of dignitaries and press photographers.\n\nBrandt had actively resisted the early Nazi regime, and had spent most of the time of Hitler's reign in exile. The occasion of Brandt's visit to Poland at the time was the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and the People's Republic of Poland, guaranteeing German acceptance of the new borders of Poland. The treaty was one of the Brandt-initiated policy steps (the 'Ostpolitik') to ease tensions between West and East during the Cold War.\n\nReaction\n\nIn Germany\n\nOn the same day, Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, which acknowledged the Oder-Neisse-Line as the final German border with Poland. Both actions attracted controversy within Germany, as did Ostpolitik in general, favored only by a narrow majority in public opinion. It was disputed within his own party, whose voters had included a significant proportion of expellees from the formerly German territories in Poland, most whom then went to the conservative parties.\n\nAccording to a Der Spiegel survey of the time, 48% of all West Germans thought the \"Kniefall\" was excessive, 41% said it was appropriate and 11% had no opinion.  The Kniefall was a symbolic action the opposition tried to use against Brandt, as in a Constructive Vote of No Confidence in April 1972, which Brandt won by only two votes. Brandt's landslide win in the next elections in late 1972 was also due to the growing view among voters that Brandt's Ostpolitik\u2014symbolized by the Kniefall\u2014and his reformist domestic policies were helping to boost Germany's international reputation and should be supported. The SPD won its best federal election result ever.\n\nInternationally\n\nWhile at the time, positive reactions may have been limited, his show of humility was a small but vital step in bridging the gaps World War II had left between Germany and Eastern Europe. In historical terms, Brandt gained much renown for this act, and it is thought to be one of the reasons he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.\n\nA monument to Willy Brandt was unveiled on 6 December 2000, in Willy Brandt Square in Warsaw (near the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument) on the eve of the 30th anniversary of his famous gesture.\n\nBrandt's memories\n\nBrandt was repeatedly interviewed about the genuflection and about his motives. He later noted that:\n\n(German original) \"Unter der Last der j\u00fcngsten Geschichte tat ich, was Menschen tun, wenn die Worte versagen. So gedachte ich Millionen Ermordeter.\" \n\n(English translation) Under the weight of recent history, I did what people do when words fail them. In this way I commemorated millions of murdered people.\nQuestion:\nKniefall von Warschau (German for 'Warsaw Genuflection') is a 1970 incident involving which European statesman who paid homage to WWII's Warsaw Ghetto Uprising during his visit to the city?\nAnswer:\nWilly Brandt\nPassage:\nGillespie Road\nGillespie Road is a road in Highbury, north London, running east-west along the north side of the Arsenal Stadium, previously home of Arsenal Football Club. Arsenal tube station was originally named Gillespie Road, before being given its current name in 1932 following pressure from the club. At the time of Arsenal's move to the nearby Emirates Stadium in July 2006, an email was circulated by  supporters of  rival club Tottenham Hotspur inviting petitions to the Mayor of London, asking him to give the station back its original name [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?viewDETAILS&grid\n&xml=/sport/2006/01/14/sfndry14.xml] which proved unsuccessful.

The title is an invention of the Victorian public and press, dating from its exhibition in the opening display at the Bethnal Green Museum in 1872\u201375, just after its arrival in England, after which it was regularly reproduced as a print, and became among of the best known old master paintings in Britain. The unknown subject is in fact not laughing, but can be said to have an enigmatic smile, much amplified by his upturned moustache.\n\nDescription\n\nThe portrait measures 83 \u00d7 67.3 cm (32.7 \u00d7 26.5 in) and is inscribed at top right \"\u00c6'TA SV\u00c6 26/A\u00b01624\", which expands to \"aetatis suae 26, anno 1624\" in Latin and means that the portrait was painted when the sitter was 26 and in the year 1624.   The identity of the man was unknown for centuries, and though the recorded 19th century titles in Dutch, English and French mostly suggest a military man, or at least an officer in one of the part-time militia companies that were often the subjects of group portraits, including some by Hals and later Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642), in fact he was as likely to be a wealthy civilian and Pieter Biesboer has identified him as Tieleman Roosterman.  The composition is lively and spontaneous, and despite the apparent labour involved in the gorgeous, and very expensive, silk costume, close inspection reveals long, quick brush strokes. The turning pose and low viewpoint are found in other portraits by Hals and here allow emphasis on the embroidered sleeve and lace cuff.  There are many emblems in the embroidery: signifying \"the pleasures and pains of love\" are \"bees, arrows, flaming cornucopiae, lovers' knots and tongues of fire\", while an obelisk or pyramid signifies strength and Mercury's cap and caduceus fortune. \n\nIn general, commissioned portraits such as this rarely showed adults smiling until the late 18th century, though smiling is often seen in tronies and figures in genre painting.  But Hals is an exception to the general rule and often showed sitters with broader smiles than here, and in informal poses that bring an impression of movement and spontaneity to his work. \n\nThe effect of the eyes appearing to follow the viewer from every angle is a result of the subject being depicted as looking directly forward, toward the artist's point of view, combined with being a static two dimensional representation of this from whichever angle the painting itself is viewed. \n\nHistory\n\nThe painting's provenance only goes back to a sale in The Hague in 1770; after further Dutch sales it was bought by the Franco-Swiss banker and collector the Comte de Pourtal\u00e8s-Gorgier in 1822.  After his death the painting was acquired at the auction of his collection in Paris in 1865 by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, who outbid Baron James de Rothschild at more than six times the sales estimate.  It was in Hertford's Paris home in 1871, listed as portrait d'un homme (\"portrait of a man\"), and then brought to London, probably for the purpose of exhibiting it in a large and long loan exhibition of old master paintings at Bethnal Green, which was deliberately sited away from the West End of London to attract the working classes.  The exhibition was a huge success and A Cavalier (the catalogue title) a particular hit with both public and the critics; it played a considerable part in raising the critical estimation of Hals in England.  By 1888, when it was again exhibited at the Royal Academy, it had become Laughing Cavalier, though a cleaning in the intervening period (in 1884) may have changed the effect.   The critic in the Athenaeum noted a brighter appearance, but also that \"The man smiles rather than laughs\".  Hertford's collection was bequeathed to his natural son Sir Richard Wallace Bt., whose widow donated it and his London house to the nation as the Wallace Collection.\n\nDerivatives\n\nThe Laughing Cavalier is used by McEwan's beer as its logo. It has been modified showing the Laughing Cavalier enjoying the beer. \n\nIn the Scarlet Pimpernel adventure series by Emma Orczy, The Laughing Cavalier is a prequel recounting the story of the supposed subject of the painting, who is an ancestor of her main hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy Blakeney.\n\nThe \"eyes following you round the room\" trope has long been a stand-by in British comedy, used by Pete and Dud in The Art Gallery,  among many others, sometimes in the form of a portrait with cut-away eyes that can be used as a peephole.\nQuestion:\nWho painted the famous picture the Laughing Cavalier?\nAnswer:\nFrans Hals\nPassage:\nCarl Douglas\nCarlton George Douglas (born 10 May 1942), also known by his stage name Carl Douglas, is a Jamaican recording artist. Douglas rose to prominence after releasing his single \"Kung Fu Fighting\".\n\nEarly life\n\nCarlton George Douglas was born on 10 May 1942 in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nCareer\n\nDouglas' career was based in the United Kingdom, where his single \"Kung Fu Fighting\" ranked number one in both the U.K. Singles Chart and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1974. The single sold 11 million copies worldwide,   making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. The single was later certified gold by the RIAA on 27 November 1974. \n\nThe single, which is a homage to martial arts films, has overshadowed the rest of Douglas' career; resulting in his appearance on cover versions of the single. In the United States, Douglas was considered a \"one-hit wonder\" since he was only known for \"Kung Fu Fighting\". However, in the United Kingdom, he has two other singles that made it into the \"Top 40\", which were \"Dance the Kung Fu\", which peaked at number 35 in the charts; and \"Run Back\", which peaked at number 25.\n\nDouglas was once managed by Eric Woolfson,  who later became the primary songwriter behind \"The Alan Parsons Project\".\n\nIn 1998, a re-recording of \"Kung Fu Fighting\", performed by British dance act Bus Stop and which featured Douglas's vocals, peaked at number 8 in the \"UK Singles Chart\". \n\nThe single \"Dance The Kung Fu\", was sampled on \"Cuda nie widy\" from 2001 album Nibylandia, and later by DJ Premier on his 2007 remix of Nike's 25th Air Force One anniversary single \"Classic (Better Than I've Ever Been)\", featuring Kanye West, Nas, KRS-One and Rakim.

The Coptic Christians killed in this incident were considered martyrs of the Coptic Orthodox Church by Pope Shenouda III.\n\nKosheh\n\nKosheh is located on the east bank of the Nile in Sohag governorate, a few miles east of Balyana. The population of Kosheh is about 35,000 and 70% of the village are Christian Copts. Kosheh is the trading center for a number of villages in the area. There is little farmland in Kosheh; it serves rather as the shopping nexus for the rural areas around it. Most of the shopkeepers are Copts, while most of the farmers in the surrounding villages are Muslims from Arab tribes.  \n\nFirst Kosheh Massacre\n\nTensions between Christians and Muslims had started a few years earlier, in August 1998, in what is known as the First Kosheh Massacre. In this incident, two Copts were murdered by Muslims. The Muslims in turn were allegedly seeking revenge for the \u201cpoisoning\u201d of a brother who had actually died of natural causes. In response, the Egyptian police responded by rounding up about 1,200 Christians for investigation into the murder. When Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, criticised the arrests, he was himself arrested with two of his priests, and was charged with inciting strife and damaging national unity between Christians and Muslims.\n\nIn October 1998, an article by Christina Lamb in London\u2019s Daily Telegraph reported that some of the arrested Copts had undergone mock crucifixions and that Metropolitan Wissa faced possible execution. The Egyptian government was outraged at the negative publicity, and arrested the head of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), whom it accused of having given the story to the Daily Telegraph. The head of the EOHR and Metropolitan Wissa were eventually released. Although the government promised to punish any police who had acted improperly, some of the police officers involved in the human rights violations against the Copts in el-Kosheh were in fact promoted. Thus, the First Kosheh Massacre turned into an international incident. As a result, Coptic groups in the West began to push for the US Congress to include Egypt among nations that discriminate against Christians.\n\nSecond Kosheh Massacre\n\nThe Second Kosheh Massacre took place about one year later, on Friday 31 December 1999. The incidence stemmed from a quarrel between a Christian merchant and a Muslim customer. The misunderstanding strained Muslim-Christian relations in the community. Relatives of the Muslim customer targeted Christian-owned shops and homes, which were looted, destroyed, and burned. Initially, the police was able to contain the situation. However, two days later on Sunday 2 January 2000, riots spread violence into neighbouring villages and lead to the murders of 20 Christians. One Muslim was also accidentally shot dead by a fellow Muslim.   More than 40 people were injured in the two-day incident. 260 shops, houses and kiosks were also deliberately burnt or damaged. Most of the killings took place in the outskirts of el-Kosheh, especially in the agriculture fields. This event was one of Egypt's bloodiest massacres.\n\nThe local authorities during the incident did little to control the situation. There were some cases where these officers participated in the killings.\nFollowing the massacre, the entire Coptic community felt that these events epitomised the criminal negligence of the Egyptian administration, represented in its police force, when it comes to protecting Coptic lives and property. Since local police units are often drawn from the local community, local feuds including Muslim resentment of Christian families can very well color police behaviour.\n\nOn 1 December 2000, a criminal court in Egypt's Sohag governorate released without bail all 89 defendants charged in the New Year's massacre in el-Kosheh. It was unprecedented in Egypt that several dozen murder suspects would be released without bail a month before their verdict was determined. All suspects that were initially arrested in connection to this massacre were eventually acquitted had their charges dropped. The only person convicted in the massacre was a Muslim charged with accidental killing of another Muslim, and sentenced to 13 years in prison.  No one was ever convicted for the murder of the 21 Christian victims. This led to outrage in the Coptic community who felt that these suspects should be in custody. The Pope of Alexandria Shenouda III rejected the verdict openly, and told reporters \"We want to challenge this ruling. We don't accept it.\" Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, called the ruling \"A shame that defames the reputation of Egypt and an invitation for more violence\". Egypt's Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahid appealed the acquittal verdict of the defendants, stating that \"there is no doubt that 21 people were killed, and the killers must be brought to justice,\" \"We never imagined that they would release the killers, but this is Egypt\" a Copt from el-Kosheh admitted by telephone.\n\nSix days following the acquittal of the defendants, the homes of four Christian families in el-Kosheh were set to fire and completely destroyed. One of the homeowners who reported the arson to the Egyptian police was tortured and forced to sign a statement prepared by a public prosecutor charging him with perpetrating the whole incident. He was subsequently forced to post bail for his own release.\nQuestion:\nThe Kosheh Massacre took place in which African country in 2000?\nAnswer:\nEGY\nPassage:\nDolomite\nDolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate, ideally CaMg(CO3)2. The word dolomite is also used to describe the sedimentary carbonate rock, which is composed predominantly of the mineral dolomite (also known as dolostone).\n\nHistory\n\nMost probably the mineral dolomite was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1768.  In 1778, it was described by the Austrian naturalist Belsazar Hacquet as the \"stinking stone\" (, ).   In 1791, it was described as a rock by the French naturalist and geologist D\u00e9odat Gratet de Dolomieu (1750\u20131801), first in buildings of the old city of Rome, and later as samples collected in what is now known as the Dolomite Alps of northern Italy. Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure first named the mineral (after Dolomieu) in March 1792.  Hacquet and Dolomieu met in Laibach (Ljubljana) in 1784,  which may have contributed to Dolomieu's work.\n\nProperties\n\nThe mineral dolomite crystallizes in the trigonal-rhombohedral system. It forms white, tan, gray, or pink crystals. Dolomite is a double carbonate, having an alternating structural arrangement of calcium and magnesium ions. It does not rapidly dissolve or effervesce (fizz) in dilute hydrochloric acid as calcite does. Crystal twinning is common.\n\nSolid solution exists between dolomite, the iron-dominant ankerite and the manganese-dominant kutnohorite.Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S. Hurlbut Jr., Manual of Mineralogy, Wiley, 20th ed., p. 339-340 ISBN 0-471-80580-7 Small amounts of iron in the structure give the crystals a yellow to brown tint. Manganese substitutes in the structure also up to about three percent MnO. A high manganese content gives the crystals a rosy pink color. Lead, zinc, and cobalt also substitute in the structure for magnesium. The mineral dolomite is closely related to huntite Mg3Ca(CO3)4.\n\nBecause dolomite can be dissolved by slightly acidic water, areas of dolomite are important as aquifers and contribute to karst terrain formation. \n\nFormation\n\nModern dolomite formation has been found to occur under anaerobic conditions in supersaturated saline lagoons along the Rio de Janeiro coast of Brazil, namely, Lagoa Vermelha and Brejo do Espinho.  It is often thought that dolomite will develop only with the help of sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. Desulfovibrio brasiliensis).  However, low-temperature dolomite may occur in natural environments rich in organic matter and microbial cell surfaces. This occurs as a result of magnesium complexation by carboxyl groups associated with organic matter. \n\nVast deposits of dolomite are present in the geological record, but the mineral is relatively rare in modern environments. Reproducible, inorganic low-temperature syntheses of dolomite and magnesite were published for the first time in 1999. Those laboratory experiments showed how the initial precipitation of a metastable \"precursor\" (such as magnesium calcite) will change gradually into more and more of the stable phase (such as dolomite or magnesite) during periodical intervals of dissolution and re-precipitation. The general principle governing the course of this irreversible geochemical reaction has been coined \"breaking Ostwald's step rule\". \n\nThere is some evidence for a biogenic occurrence of dolomite. One example is that of the formation of dolomite in the urinary bladder of a Dalmatian dog, possibly as the result of an illness or infection. \n\nFormation of dolomite from solution and its link with biogenic dolomite\n\nIn 2015, it was experimentally discovered that the direct crystallization of dolomite can occur from solution at temperatures between 60\u2013220\u00a0\u00b0C. Dolomite forms through a three-stage process: 1) A nanoparticulate magnesium-deficient, amorphous calcium carbonate (Mg-ACC) forms; 2) After a temperature-dependent induction time, this Mg-ACC partially dehydrates and orders prior to its rapid (<5 min) crystallization to non-stoichiometric proto-dolomite (with a lower Mg/Ca ratio compared to dolomite). This occurs via the dissolution of Mg-ACC, followed by the secondary nucleation of proto-dolomite from solution. 3) Finally, the proto-dolomite crystallization proceeds via spherulitic growth that follows a growth front nucleation mechanism with a de novo and continuous formation of nanocrystalline proto-dolomite subunits that form spherical aggregates. In stage three of the reaction, the proto-dolomite transforms to highly crystalline and stoichiometric dolomite on a much longer timescale (hours to days), via an Ostwald-ripening mechanism. Such a three-stage crystallization can explain microbially induced proto-dolomites observed in modern hypersaline settings and may also be the route by which the Cryogenian cap dolomite deposits of the Neoproterozoic formed. \n\nUses\n\nDolomite is used as an ornamental stone, a concrete aggregate, and a source of magnesium oxide, as well as in the Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock, and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. Where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly, dolomite is sometimes used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel. Large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass.\n\nIn horticulture, dolomite and dolomitic limestone are added to soils and soilless potting mixes as a pH buffer and as a magnesium source. Home and container gardening are common examples of this use.\n\nDolomite is also used as the substrate in marine (saltwater) aquariums to help buffer changes in pH of the water.\n\nCalcined dolomite is also used as a catalyst for destruction of tar in the gasification of biomass at high temperature. \n\nParticle physics researchers like to build particle detectors under layers of dolomite to enable the detectors to detect the highest possible number of exotic particles. Because dolomite contains relatively minor quantities of radioactive materials, it can insulate against interference from cosmic rays without adding to background radiation levels. \n\nDolomite is a popular choice for motorcycle speedway tracks throughout Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDolomite is used in the ceramic industry and in studio pottery as a glaze ingredient, contributing magnesium and calcium as glass melt fluxes.\nQuestion:\nDolomite is an ore of which metal?\nAnswer:\nC8H14MgO10\nPassage:\nFarringford House\nFarringford was the much loved home of Poet Laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, for forty years until his death in 1892. The main house dates from 1806 with gothic embellishments and extensions added from the 1830s. Of particular historical importance is the second library built by Lady Emily Tennyson in 1871 with a play room below connected by a turreted winding staircase. The grounds are laid to lawn, rose borders and informal planting. Evidence remains of Tennyson's planting schemes together with a section of the walled garden and wooden footpaths.\n\nThe house and grounds are currently undergoing a programme of restoration having been a hotel since it left the Tennyson family's ownership in the 1940s. The house is scheduled to open in 2016 as a study centre and will host group visits, writer's retreats, creative workshops, concerts and exhibitions. On the estate there are fourteen 4* self-catering cottages available all year round, a helicopter landing pad, a restaurant which caters to both guests and local residents, a 9-hole golf course, outdoor heated swimming pool, tennis court and children's play area. \n\nThe estate is located on Bedbury Lane, Freshwater Bay, on the Western tip of the Isle of Wight. Some of the surrounding houses, particularly those in Middleton at the start of Moons Hill are connected with the Farringford's history, once forming part of the estate. The houses at the end of Queens Road, the junction near the farm used to be stables where Fred Pontin's horses where kept.\n\nSouthern Vectis' Needles Breezer Open Top bus has a stop outside the Farringford and this is the only bus that goes down Bedbury Lane towards Alum Bay.\n\nTennyson wrote of Farringford:\n\nTennyson rented Farringford in 1853, and then bought it in 1856.  He found that there were too many starstruck tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to \"Aldworth\", a stately home on a hill known as Blackdown between Lurgashall and Fernhurst, about 2\u00a0km south of Haslemere in West Sussex in 1869. However, he returned to Farringford to spend the winters.\nQuestion:\nFarringford House on the Isle of Wight was the home of which poet?\nAnswer:\nA. tennyson\nPassage:\nOphidiophobia\nOphidiophobia or ophiophobia is a particular type of specific phobia, the abnormal fear of snakes. Fear of snakes is sometimes called by a more general term, herpetophobia, fear of reptiles and/or amphibians. The word comes from the Greek words \"ophis\" () which refers to snake and \"phobia\" () meaning fear. \n\nCare must also be taken to differentiate people who do not like snakes or fear them for their venom or the inherent danger involved. An  ophidiophobe would not only fear them when in live contact but also dreads to think about them or even see them on TV or in pictures. \n\nAbout a third of adult humans are ophidiophobic, making this the most common reported phobia.  Scientists have theorised that humans may have an innate reaction to snakes, which was vital for the survival of humankind as it allowed such dangerous threats to be identified immediately. \n\nFictional cases\n\n* Ophidiophobia is a characteristic of adventurer Indiana Jones.\nQuestion:\nOphidiophobia is an abnormal fear of what creatures?\nAnswer:\nSnkae\nPassage:\nNew Zealand is home to 3 million people and 60 million sheep\nNew Zealand is home to 3 million people and 60 million sheep\nStatistics NZ Home > Browse for statistics > Population > Population mythbusters > New Zealand is home to 3 million people and 60 million sheep\nNew Zealand is home to 3 million people and 60 million sheep\nSections on this page\nPopulation mythbusters\nIt\u2019s widely believed that New Zealand has 20 sheep for every person \u2013 information that adds weight to myriad sheep jokes. How accurate is this these days?\nTo begin with, we must find out how many people live in New Zealand. The population passed the 4 million mark in 2003. Our\u00a0 population clock put the event at precisely 5.30 pm on Thursday, 24 April. By 30 June 2015, the estimated resident population had reached 4.60 million people.\nNext, we must find out how many sheep we have. According to Statistics NZ's agricultural production statistics, we had an estimated\u00a029.5 million sheep at 30 June 2015.\nThis means that the sheep-to-person ratio has fallen\u00a0and contrary to popular belief there are actually about\u00a0six\u00a0sheep per person, not 20.\nConclusion\nThis myth is busted. The information is now out of date.\nHowever, it is still true that people in New Zealand are greatly outnumbered by sheep, and our sheep-to-person ratio is high relative to other countries. It\u2019s still twice as high as Australia's, for example, which currently has\u00a0fewer than three sheep per person. As with New Zealand, this is due to declining sheep numbers and a growing human population.\nNew Zealanders have also long been outnumbered by cattle, although not to the same extent as by sheep. There are currently 6.4 million dairy and 3.6 million beef cattle in New Zealand. While the cattle population is growing at a slower rate than the human population, there has been a notable shift in the make-up of the cattle population. In 1994, 43.2 percent of cattle were dairy cattle. By 2015, that proportion had increased to 64.0 percent.\nA bit of sheep history\nNew Zealand sheep numbers peaked in 1982, with a total of 70.3 million sheep. In the same year, 3.18 million people lived in New Zealand. This works out to 22 sheep per person.\nSheep numbers have gradually declined since the mid-1980s, due to factors such as depressed wool prices, droughts in the 1990s, and competition from other land-intensive farming activities (eg dairy and forestry). While sheep numbers stabilised and even grew slightly in the mid-2000s, numbers soon decreased again, reaching the low of\u00a029.5 million in 2015.\nSome sheep facts from\u00a0 An Encyclopedia of New Zealand for the historians among us:\nNew Zealand's first sheep were set ashore by Captain Cook in 1773.\nRapid sheep population growth in the 1850s and 1860s was due mostly to permanent immigration, rather than natural increase. In 1864 alone, 13,000 sheep arrived in Canterbury from Australia. Droughts meant that sheep could always be bought cheaply from Australia. Drought continues to affect Australian farmers and sheep numbers.\nThe first shipment of frozen lamb and mutton sailed to London from Port Chalmers on the Dunedin in 1882.\nFor your information\nQuestion:\nWhat country has about 4.5 million people, but 40 million sheep?\nAnswer:\nN Z\nPassage:\nSabatier\nSabatier is the maker's mark used by several kitchen knife manufacturers\u2014by itself it is not a registered brand name. The name Sabatier is considered to imply a high-quality knife produced by one of a number of manufacturers in the Thiers region of France using a fully forged process; the knives of some of these manufacturers are highly regarded. However, the name \"Sabatier\" came into use before intellectual property laws and is not protected; knives legally bearing the name range from high-quality knives made in France to cheap mass-produced products of poor quality from France and other countries; a registered logo or full name, or both, such as \"65 Sabatier Perrier\", is necessary to establish origin and quality.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe name originated in Thiers, France at the beginning of the 19th century. The area of Thiers has been associated with the cutlery industry since the Middle Ages.  With the advent of the industrial age manufacturers began to consolidate their crafts or trades by creating brand or trade marks.\n\nEarly controversy\n\nTwo separate families began using the name Sabatier to market their knives. The families do not appear to be related except by name and craft. Jean Sabatier of Le Moutier (lower Thiers) and Phillipe Sabatier of Bellevue (upper Thiers). There is much dispute who registered the trademark first with each citing evidence.\n\nBrand names\n\nThe use of the Sabatier name is an anomaly of \"branding\" because the name was used by many different companies before intellectual property or trademark laws were fully established in France. In order to distinguish between the various makers of Sabatier knives, manufacturers are required to include a second word or symbol along with SABATIER. Over the years many marks were registered. In 1979, after the sale of the Moutier Sabatier brands to Cuisinox, the various holders of the brands formed an association to protect the brand name.\n\n* SABATIER fr\u00e8res\n* K SABATIER\n* SABATIER PERRIER\n* 65 SABATIER\n* 62 SABATIER\n* France SABATIER Jeune K Garanti\n* SABATIER Jeune Garanti with a bunch of grapes\n* SABATIER Acier Fondu Garanti with a bunch of grapes\n* France SABATIER Acier Fondu couronne K Garanti\n* V\u00e9ritable SABATIER France\n* Professional SABATIER\n* SABATIER Professional\n* V SABATIER France\n* V SABATIER Acier Fondu Garanti\n* V SABATIER Extra Fin\n* SABATIER 689 Couronn\u00e9\n* SABATIER Couronn\u00e9\n* SABATIER 589 Couronn\u00e9\n* SABATIER Trompette\n* SABATIER Deg\n* SABATIER****\n* SabatieR\n* SABATIER Trumpet France\n* Sarry SABATIER\n* Le vrai SABATIER\n* Le seul SABATIER\n* L\u2019unique SABATIER 1\u00e8re qualit\u00e9\n* SABATIER with a stylised slicing disk\n* SABATIER Lion\n* SABATIER Diamant\n* SABATIER Elephant\n\nManufacturing process\n\nAmong the many Sabatier manufacturers in Thiers, France, most provide high quality cutlery using traditional forging techniques that were developed in the area in the early and mid-19th century. Most of these manufacturers use a \"fully forged\" technique and a hand shaping and sharpening process using local skilled labour.\n\nFully forged means that three of the four knife parts (blade, bolster, tang and handle) are forged from a single piece of steel. In this process, a single cylinder shaped steel billet is heated where the bolster will be, and squeezed from the ends to create a bulge. The entire piece is heated again and forged to the shape of the blade, bolster, and tang using forging dies in one operation. Afterward, a clipping tool is used to cut the forged piece to the rough shape of the knife. Finally, the handles are riveted on, and the final shaping and sharpening is done by hand. The alternative way to manufacture knives is stamping; forging has traditionally been considered superior, but from the late 20th century some knives of excellent quality have been produced by stamping.\n\nConfusion continues\n\nWhile there are many knife manufacturers using Sabatier as their brand, some Sabatier manufacturers are considered authentic, and some are not. Generally speaking among connoisseurs of fine cutlery, only knives manufactured in Thiers, France from well established manufacturers from the 19th century are considered \"genuine\" Sabatier knives.\n\nMany other manufacturers, both in France and elsewhere, use the Sabatier name on their knives; however, they are usually mass-produced, and of poor quality.  Neither words such as vrai or garanti, nor \"Made in France\", ensure a good knife.\n\nCompanies selling Sabatier knives\n\nSabatier brands have been sold on to many companies over the years. The following list is an attempt to link the present day owners to the brands.\n\nETS Sabatier A\u00een\u00e9 & Perrier\n\nSabatier A\u00een\u00e9 & Perrier claim to be the oldest Sabatier knife maker still in existence and operated by the descendants of Phillipe Sabatier of Bellevue, Thiers, France.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nCaipirinha\nCaipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail, made with cacha\u00e7a (sugarcane hard liquor), sugar and lime.  Cacha\u00e7a,  also known as Pinga or Caninha, is Brazil's most common distilled alcoholic beverage. Although both rum and cacha\u00e7a are made from sugarcane-derived products, in cacha\u00e7a the alcohol results from the fermentation of fresh sugarcane juice that is then distilled, while rum is usually made from refinery by-products such as molasses. \n\nThe drink is prepared by muddling the fruit and the sugar together, and adding the liquor. This can be made into a single glass, usually large, that can be shared amongst people, or into a larger jar, from where it is served in individual glasses.\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough the real origins of caipirinha, as it is known today, are unknown, according to one account it began around 1918 in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo with a popular recipe made with lime, garlic and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu. Today it is still being used as a remedy for the common cold. As it was quite common to add some distilled spirits to home remedies, in order to expedite the therapeutic effect, rum was commonly used. \"Until one day someone decided to remove the garlic and honey. Then added a few tablespoons sugar to reduce the acidity of lime. The ice came next, to ward off the heat,\" explains Carlos Lima, executive director of IBRAC (Brazilian Institute of Cacha\u00e7a).  \n\nThe caipirinha is the strongest national cocktail of Brazil  and is imbibed in restaurants, bars, and many households throughout the country. Once almost unknown outside Brazil, the drink has become more popular and more widely available in recent years, in large part due to the rising availability of first-rate brands of cacha\u00e7a outside Brazil.  The International Bartenders Association has designated it as one of their Official Cocktails.\n\nName\n\nThe word caipirinha is the diminutive of the word caipira, which in Brazilian Portuguese refers to someone from the countryside (specifically, someone from the rural parts of south-central Brazil), being similar to US English hillbilly or the Lowland Scots teuchter. Caipira is a two-gender noun. The diminutive mostly refers to the drink in which case it is a feminine noun.\n\nVariations\n\n*Although Brazilian law (Decree 6.871  based on Normative Ruling 55, from Oct. 31, 2008)  as well as the International Bartenders Association (IBA)  allow the use of the name caipirinha for the version with lime only, the term is often used to describe any cacha\u00e7a-and-fruit-juice drink with the fruit's name (e.g. a passionfruit caipirinha, kiwifruit caipirinha or strawberry caipirinha).\n*Caipifruta is a very popular caipirinha drink in Brazil, consisting of cacha\u00e7a, crushed fresh fruits (either singly or in combination), and crushed ice.  The most popular fresh fruits used to create caipifrutas are tangerine, lime, kiwifruit, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon, grapes, mango, caj\u00e1 (Spondias mombin fruit), and caju (cashew fruit).\n\nDerivations\n\nThere are many derivations of caipirinha in which other spirits substitute for cacha\u00e7a. Some include:\n\n*The Caipivodka (also known as Caipiroska, Caipiroshka or Caipirovka), in which vodka substitutes for cacha\u00e7a. Very popular in Finland and Sweden. In Africa this version is also called \"Dawa\", Swahili for medicine.\n*The Caipiroska Negra, Black Caipiroshka or Caipiblack is made with black vodka instead of cacha\u00e7a.\n*Caipir\u00edssima is a caipirinha made with rum instead of cacha\u00e7a; the word was coined for an advertisement for a popular rum brand in the late '70s.\n*Caipinheger is another variation made using Steinh\u00e4ger.  \n*Caipir\u00e3o is another Portuguese variation made using Licor Beir\u00e3o instead of cacha\u00e7a. Beir\u00e3o liquor is very sweet, so no sugar is used. \n*Caipisake (also called Sakeirinha) is made with sake instead of cacha\u00e7a. Often made with strawberries or kiwifruit.  \n*A variation from Italy is made using Campari instead of cacha\u00e7a.\nQuestion:\nThe drink Caipirinha is the national cocktail of which South American country?\nAnswer:\nBrazil\nPassage:\nGuy Garvey\nGuy Edward John Garvey (born 6 March 1974)   is an English singer, songwriter and BBC 6 Music presenter. He is the lead singer and principal songwriter of the alternative rock band Elbow.\n\nEarly life\n\nGarvey grew up in a middle class family in Bury, Lancashire (now Greater Manchester). His father spent most of his working life as a newspaper proofreader, later joining ICI as a chemist; his mother was a police officer before becoming a psychologist. One of seven siblings, Garvey has five older sisters \u2014 Gina, Louise, Sam, Karen and Becky \u2014 whilst his younger brother is actor Marcus Garvey.\n\nCareer\n\nIn the early 90s, while at sixth-form college in Bury, Garvey formed Elbow with Mark and Craig Potter, Pete Turner, and Richard Jupp. He serves as the main songwriter and lyricist of Elbow, and has been widely praised for his songwriting throughout his career. As well as vocal duties Garvey has also played a wide variety of instruments live including both electric and acoustic guitar, trumpet, and various forms of percussion. Elbow won two Ivor Novello awards for best song writing for the 2008 single \"Grounds for Divorce\" as well as best contemporary song for \"One Day Like This\".  He was awarded a lifetime achievement honour by the Radio Academy in 2014.  In the same year, he also featured on the re-launched Band Aid charity's single to raise funds for the Ebola crisis in Africa. Garvey, with Elbow, was commissioned by the BBC to write the theme song for the 2012 London Olympics and Elbow performed this song, \"First Steps\" at the closing ceremony of the Olympics. \n\nAmongst other work, Garvey produced and recorded the I Am Kloot album Natural History (2001). Alongside Elbow keyboard player Craig Potter he also produced I Am Kloot's single \"Maybe I Should\" (2005, not associated with any album), their Mercury Music Prize nominated 2010 album Sky at Night and their 2013 album Let It All In. Elbow were themselves Mercury Music Prize nominees, in 2011, for the album Build a Rocket Boys! and won the prize in 2008 for their album \"The Seldom Seen Kid\".  In addition, Garvey made an appearance on Massive Attack's 2010 album record Heligoland.\n\nHe is a member of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA).  In April 2012 Garvey became a patron of the [http://www.craftanddesign.com/ Manchester Craft and Design Centre]. In recognition of his outstanding contribution to music he received, in July of the same year, an honorary doctorate from Manchester Metropolitan University, to become a Doctor of Arts. \n\nGarvey has been a presenter on BBC 6 Music for over five years  (Sunday afternoon 2\u00a0pm to 4\u00a0pm, British time) and previously presented a show on Sunday evenings on XFM.  \nHe had a monthly column in the now-defunct listings magazine City Life and is a patron of the Mines Advisory Group (MAG),  the Manchester-based charity responsible for clearing war zones of mines and munitions worldwide.\n\nIn 2015 Garvey presented Music Box, an iPlayer-exclusive series covering emerging and established bands. Garvey has also read several children's stories for the CBeebies \"Bedtime Stories\" program on the BBC.\n\nIn 2015 Garvey announced that he would be releasing his first solo studio album while continuing his duties as Elbow's lead songwriter. The resulting album, Courting the Squall, was released on 30 October 2015 by Polydor Records in the UK.   On 27 October 2015 Garvey appeared on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland, where he performed \"Angela's Eyes\" and \"Belly of the Whale\". \n\nPersonal life\n\nGarvey was in a long-term relationship with writer Emma Jane Unsworth until 2012. He began dating actress Rachael Stirling in 2015.

The stories were originally published between 1964 and 1965 in the Italian periodicals Il Caff\u00e8 and Il Giorno. Each story takes a scientific \"fact\" (though sometimes a falsehood by today's understanding), and builds an imaginative story around it.  An always extant being called Qfwfq narrates all of the stories save two, each of which is a memory of an event in the history of the universe. Qfwfq also narrates some stories in Calvino's t zero.\n\nAll of the stories in Cosmicomics, together with those from t zero and other sources, are now available in a single volume collection, The Complete Cosmicomics (Penguin UK, 2009).\n\nThe first U.S. edition, translated by William Weaver, won the National Book Award in the Translation category.\n[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1969.html \"National Book Awards \u2013 1969\"]. National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-11.There was a \"Translation\" award from 1967 to 1983.\n\nContents\n\n*The Distance of the Moon, the first and probably the best known story. Calvino takes the fact that the Moon used to be much closer to the Earth, and builds a story about a love triangle among people who used to jump between the Earth and the Moon, in which lovers drift apart as the Moon recedes.\n*At Daybreak \u2014 Life before matter condenses.\n*A Sign in Space \u2014 The idea that the galaxy slowly revolves becomes a story about a being who is desperate to leave behind some unique sign of his existence.  This story also is a direct illustration of one of the tenets of postmodern theory \u2014 that the sign is not the thing it signifies, nor can one claim to fully or properly describe a thing or an idea with a word or other symbol.\n*All at One Point \u2014 The fact that all matter and creation used to exist in a single point.  \"Naturally, we were all there\u2014old Qfwfq said\u2014where else could we have been? Nobody knew then that there could be space. Or time either: what use did we have for time, packed in there like sardines?\"\n*Without Colors \u2014 Before there was an atmosphere, everything was the same shade of gray. As the atmosphere appears, so do colors.

It is a largely fictionalized version of the life of Robert Stroud, a federal prison inmate known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" because of his life with birds. In spite of the title, much of the action is set at Leavenworth Prison, where Stroud was jailed with his birds. When moved to Alcatraz he was not allowed to keep any pets. \n\nThe film was adapted by Guy Trosper from the 1955 book by Thomas E. Gaddis. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Burt Lancaster), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Telly Savalas), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Thelma Ritter) and Best Cinematography, Black-and-White. \n\nPlot\n\nRobert Stroud (Lancaster) is imprisoned as a young man for committing a murder in Alaska. He is shown as a rebellious inmate, fighting against a rigid prison system: on his way to jail by train he breaks open the window to allow the suffocating inmates to breathe. His rebellious attitude puts him in conflict with Harvey Shoemaker (Malden), the warden of Leavenworth Prison.\n\nWhile in jail, Stroud learns that his mother (Ritter) tried to visit him but was denied and told to return later in the week. Outraged, he attacks a guard over the issue and the man is killed. Stroud is sentenced to death, but his mother runs a successful campaign and it is commuted to life in prison. The terms of the sentence require that he be kept in solitary confinement for the rest of his life.\n\nTo break the monotony, Stroud adopts an orphaned baby sparrow as a pet. This starts a trend and he and the other convicts acquire birds, such as canaries, as gifts from the outside. Before long, Stroud has built up a collection of birds and cages. When they fall ill, he conducts experiments and comes up with a cure. As the years pass, Stroud becomes an expert on bird diseases and even publishes a book on the subject. His writings are so impressive that a doctor describes him as a \"genius\".\n\nStroud later meets bird-lover Stella Johnson (Field) and agrees to go into business, marketing his bird remedies. He and Stella later marry, but his mother disapproves and this causes a rift between mother and son. He is abruptly transferred to the federal penitentiary at Alcatraz (the \"Rock\"), a new maximum security institution where he is not permitted to keep birds. He is now growing elderly but still shows a rebellious side, writing a history of the U.S. penal system that is suppressed by Shoemaker, now warden of the Rock.\n\nStill at odds with authority, Stroud nevertheless manages to help stop a prison rebellion in 1946 by throwing out the guns acquired by the convicts. He then assures the authorities that they can now re-enter the premises without fear of being shot. Although Stroud has been a thorn in his side for decades, Shoemaker acknowledges that he has never lied to him and takes him at his word.\n\nAlthough constantly denied parole, Stroud is eventually transferred to another prison in Missouri after a petition campaign. During the move, he meets several reporters and displays a range of knowledge on more than just birds, such as the technical details of a passing jet aircraft. He even gets to meet Thomas E. Gaddis (Edmond O'Brien), the author of the book based on his life.\n\nCast\n\n* Burt Lancaster as Robert Stroud\n* Karl Malden as Harvey Shoemaker\n* Thelma Ritter as Elizabeth McCartney Stroud\n* Neville Brand as Bull Ransom\n* Betty Field as Stella Johnson\n* Telly Savalas as Feto Gomez\n* Edmond O'Brien as Thomas E.

Cacha\u00e7a,  also known as Pinga or Caninha, is Brazil's most common distilled alcoholic beverage. Although both rum and cacha\u00e7a are made from sugarcane-derived products, in cacha\u00e7a the alcohol results from the fermentation of fresh sugarcane juice that is then distilled, while rum is usually made from refinery by-products such as molasses. \n\nThe drink is prepared by muddling the fruit and the sugar together, and adding the liquor. This can be made into a single glass, usually large, that can be shared amongst people, or into a larger jar, from where it is served in individual glasses.\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough the real origins of caipirinha, as it is known today, are unknown, according to one account it began around 1918 in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo with a popular recipe made with lime, garlic and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu. Today it is still being used as a remedy for the common cold. As it was quite common to add some distilled spirits to home remedies, in order to expedite the therapeutic effect, rum was commonly used. \"Until one day someone decided to remove the garlic and honey. Then added a few tablespoons sugar to reduce the acidity of lime. The ice came next, to ward off the heat,\" explains Carlos Lima, executive director of IBRAC (Brazilian Institute of Cacha\u00e7a).  \n\nThe caipirinha is the strongest national cocktail of Brazil  and is imbibed in restaurants, bars, and many households throughout the country. Once almost unknown outside Brazil, the drink has become more popular and more widely available in recent years, in large part due to the rising availability of first-rate brands of cacha\u00e7a outside Brazil.  The International Bartenders Association has designated it as one of their Official Cocktails.\n\nName\n\nThe word caipirinha is the diminutive of the word caipira, which in Brazilian Portuguese refers to someone from the countryside (specifically, someone from the rural parts of south-central Brazil), being similar to US English hillbilly or the Lowland Scots teuchter. Caipira is a two-gender noun. The diminutive mostly refers to the drink in which case it is a feminine noun.\n\nVariations\n\n*Although Brazilian law (Decree 6.871  based on Normative Ruling 55, from Oct. 31, 2008)  as well as the International Bartenders Association (IBA)  allow the use of the name caipirinha for the version with lime only, the term is often used to describe any cacha\u00e7a-and-fruit-juice drink with the fruit's name (e.g. a passionfruit caipirinha, kiwifruit caipirinha or strawberry caipirinha).\n*Caipifruta is a very popular caipirinha drink in Brazil, consisting of cacha\u00e7a, crushed fresh fruits (either singly or in combination), and crushed ice.  The most popular fresh fruits used to create caipifrutas are tangerine, lime, kiwifruit, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon, grapes, mango, caj\u00e1 (Spondias mombin fruit), and caju (cashew fruit).\n\nDerivations\n\nThere are many derivations of caipirinha in which other spirits substitute for cacha\u00e7a. Some include:\n\n*The Caipivodka (also known as Caipiroska, Caipiroshka or Caipirovka), in which vodka substitutes for cacha\u00e7a. Very popular in Finland and Sweden. In Africa this version is also called \"Dawa\", Swahili for medicine.\n*The Caipiroska Negra, Black Caipiroshka or Caipiblack is made with black vodka instead of cacha\u00e7a.\n*Caipir\u00edssima is a caipirinha made with rum instead of cacha\u00e7a; the word was coined for an advertisement for a popular rum brand in the late '70s.\n*Caipinheger is another variation made using Steinh\u00e4ger.  \n*Caipir\u00e3o is another Portuguese variation made using Licor Beir\u00e3o instead of cacha\u00e7a. Beir\u00e3o liquor is very sweet, so no sugar is used. \n*Caipisake (also called Sakeirinha) is made with sake instead of cacha\u00e7a. Often made with strawberries or kiwifruit.  \n*A variation from Italy is made using Campari instead of cacha\u00e7a.\nQuestion:\nThe drink Caipirinha is the national cocktail of which South American country?\nAnswer:\nBrazil\nPassage:\nGuy Garvey\nGuy Edward John Garvey (born 6 March 1974)   is an English singer, songwriter and BBC 6 Music presenter. He is the lead singer and principal songwriter of the alternative rock band Elbow.\n\nEarly life\n\nGarvey grew up in a middle class family in Bury, Lancashire (now Greater Manchester).

The stories were originally published between 1964 and 1965 in the Italian periodicals Il Caff\u00e8 and Il Giorno. Each story takes a scientific \"fact\" (though sometimes a falsehood by today's understanding), and builds an imaginative story around it.  An always extant being called Qfwfq narrates all of the stories save two, each of which is a memory of an event in the history of the universe. Qfwfq also narrates some stories in Calvino's t zero.\n\nAll of the stories in Cosmicomics, together with those from t zero and other sources, are now available in a single volume collection, The Complete Cosmicomics (Penguin UK, 2009).\n\nThe first U.S. edition, translated by William Weaver, won the National Book Award in the Translation category.\n[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1969.html \"National Book Awards \u2013 1969\"]. National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-11.There was a \"Translation\" award from 1967 to 1983.\n\nContents\n\n*The Distance of the Moon, the first and probably the best known story. Calvino takes the fact that the Moon used to be much closer to the Earth, and builds a story about a love triangle among people who used to jump between the Earth and the Moon, in which lovers drift apart as the Moon recedes.\n*At Daybreak \u2014 Life before matter condenses.\n*A Sign in Space \u2014 The idea that the galaxy slowly revolves becomes a story about a being who is desperate to leave behind some unique sign of his existence.  This story also is a direct illustration of one of the tenets of postmodern theory \u2014 that the sign is not the thing it signifies, nor can one claim to fully or properly describe a thing or an idea with a word or other symbol.\n*All at One Point \u2014 The fact that all matter and creation used to exist in a single point.  \"Naturally, we were all there\u2014old Qfwfq said\u2014where else could we have been? Nobody knew then that there could be space. Or time either: what use did we have for time, packed in there like sardines?\"\n*Without Colors \u2014 Before there was an atmosphere, everything was the same shade of gray. As the atmosphere appears, so do colors. The novelty scares off Ayl, Qfwfq's love interest.\n*Games Without End \u2014 A galactic game of marbles back before the universe had formed much more than particles.\n*The Aquatic Uncle \u2014 A tale on the fact that at one stage in evolution animals left the sea and came to live on land.  The story is about a family living on land that is a bit ashamed of their old uncle who still lives in the sea, refusing to come ashore like \"civilized\" people.\n*How Much Shall We Bet \u2014 A story about betting on the long term evolution of mankind.\n*The Dinosaurs \u2014 How some dinosaurs lived after most of them had become extinct, and how it felt to be that last existing dinosaur in an age where all the current mammals feared his kind as demons.\n*The Form of Space \u2014 As the unnamed narrator \"falls\" through space, he cannot help but notice that his trajectory is parallel to that of a beautiful woman, Ursula H'x, and that of lieutenant Fenimore, who is also in love with Ursula. The narrator dreams of the shape of space changing, so that he may touch Ursula (or fight with Fenimore).\n*The Light Years \u2014 The unnamed narrator looking at other galaxies, and spotting one with a sign pointed right at him saying \"I saw you.\"  Given that there's a gulf of 100,000,000 light years, he checks his diary to find out what he had been doing that day, and finds out that it was something he wished to hide.  Then he starts to worry.\n*The Spiral \u2014 A story about life as a mollusc, and the nature of love and writing.\n\nAll of the stories feature non-human characters which have been heavily anthropomorphized.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nThe most-translated contemporary Italian writer at the time of his death in 1985, whose best known works are the Our Ancestors trilogy and the Cosmicomics collection of short stories?\nAnswer:\nCalvino\nPassage:\nmedicinal herbs: BAY TREE - Laurus nobilis\nmedicinal herbs: BAY TREE - Laurus nobilis\nmedicinal herbs\nFamily: Lauraceae (Laurel Family)\nMedicinal use of Bay Tree:\nThe bay tree has a\u00a0long history of folk use in the treatment of many ailments, particularly as an aid to digestion and in the treatment of bronchitis and influenza.

The fruit is antiseptic, aromatic, digestive, narcotic and stimulant. An infusion has been used to improve the appetite and as an emmenagogue. The fruit has also been used in making carminative medicines and was used in the past to promote abortion. A\u00a0fixed oil from the fruit is used externally to treat sprains, bruises etc, and is sometimes used as ear drops to relieve pain. The essential oil from the leaves has narcotic, antibacterial and fungicidal properties.\nDescription of the plant:\nDamp rocks and ravines, thickets and old walls.\nEdible parts of Bay Tree:\nLeaves - fresh or dried. A\u00a0spicy, aromatic flavouring, bay leaves are commonly used as a\u00a0flavouring for soups, stews etc and form an essential ingredient of the herb mix \"Bouquet Garni\". The leaves can be used fresh or are harvested in the summer and dried. The flavour of freshly dried, crushed or shredded leaves is stronger than fresh leaves, but the leaves should not be stored for longer than a\u00a0year since they will then lose their flavour. The dried fruit is used as a\u00a0flavouring. The dried leaves are brewed into a\u00a0herbal tea. An essential oil obtained from the leaves is used as a\u00a0food flavouring. Yields can vary from 1 - 3% oil.\nOther uses of the herb:\nAn essential oil from the fruit is used in soap making. The plant is highly resistant to pests and diseases, it is said to protect neighbouring plants from insect and health problems. The leaves are highly aromatic and can be used as an insect repellent, the dried leaves protect stored grain, beans etc from weevils. It is also used as a\u00a0strewing herb because of its aromatic smell and antiseptic properties. Very tolerant of clipping, it can be grown as a\u00a0screen or hedge in areas suited to its outdoor cultivation. Wood - sweetly-scented, does not wear quickly. Used for marqueterie work, walking sticks and friction sticks for making fires.\nPropagation of Bay Tree:\nSeed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in early autumn in a\u00a0greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first year. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and give them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a\u00a0frame. Can take 6 months. Cuttings of mature side shoots, 10 - 12cm with a\u00a0heel, November/December in a\u00a0cold frame. Leave for 18 months. High percentage.

This mythical bird is surrounded by folklore and legend. Read on to know about this legendary fictitious bird.\nBy Mansi Chitranshi | Saturday, February 14, 2009\nPhoenix - To Burn Itself and Rise Again From Its Ashes\nThe phoenix bird is a symbol of immortality, rebirth and afterlife. In earliest Greek and Egyptian mythology, it is linked with the sun god. As per the Greeks, Phoenix resides in Arabia, close to a cold well. Each sunrise at dawn, the sun god would stop his chariot to listen to the bird sing a melodious song while it bathed in the well.\nOnly one phoenix exists at a time. When the bird felt its death was near, every 500 to 1,461 years, it would build a nest of aromatic wood and set it on fire. The bird then was consumed by the flames.\nLegend\nThe phoenix, germinating in the legends of ancient Egypt, has become a common emblem of reincarnation and the most legendary of all magnificent birds. Covered with red and gold feathers, it carries the color of the rising sun; it had a harmonious voice that became despondent with impending bereavement. Other mortals were then so surmounted by its beauty and melancholy that they themselves fell dead.\nThe prodigy surrounding the Phoenix bird has myriad variants, with some of the most primitive accounts dating back to 8 centuries before the Christ was born. It is said that if the Phoenix is wounded, it can cure itself and enjoy a long life span.\nWhen the Phoenix gets close to the termination of its life, it's believed to build itself a nest of fragrant spices such as cinnamon and myrrh. It then sets the nest and itself on fire and is burned to ashes. Soon after, the Phoenix rises again and starts its life anew. In some customs, the new Phoenix collects the ashes of the old and takes them to Heliopolis to present them to the Sun God.\nPortrayal - What a Phoenix Looks Like\nPhoenix, as described by appearance, has the dimension of an eagle, with gold plumage around the neck, an amethyst body, and a sapphire tail. The throat has a crown, and the head has a clump of feathers.\nTraits - Some Attributes\nThe main characteristic of the phoenix is that it is reborn through fire: when it gets aged it will make a nest and put it on fire. The phoenix will envelop in the flames, but will take another life out of the ashes.  There can be only one Phoenix at a time; its life extends for many years (accounts vary from 500, 540, 1000 or 1460 years.) No one has ever seen this bird devour.  This myth was very widespread among the Egyptians, the Greek, oriental cultures, and during ancient period.\nThe Phoenix Re-emerges\nPhoenix, as they believe, is the only bird competent of restoring and reproducing its own life form. Contrasting to other birds, the Phoenix does not nourish on seeds, but on the gum of frankincense (a pungent resin) and the juices of amomum (an herb of the ginger family)\nPhoenix represents\nPhoenix is said to represent the sun, which dies ach night and take a new birth every morning. Some traditional writers also relate it with \"existing in heaven\", enjoying everlasting adolescence. Amid Christians, it signifies reincarnation.\nAlso Referred to As\nAlso called Feng-Huang- (Chinese adaptation) in this translation, the bird is sent to the world to execute astonishing tasks and to assist the development of mankind. It emerges in diverse phases of the earth's evolution, and then proceeds to heaven.\nQuestion:\nWhat mythical bird rises from its own ashes?\nAnswer:\nPh\u0153nix\nPassage:\nConnective tissue\nConnective tissue (CT) is one of the four types of biological tissue that support, connect, or separate different types of tissues and organs in the body. It develops from the mesoderm. The other three types are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and  spinal cord are composed of connective tissue.\n\nAll connective tissue apart from blood and lymph consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers),  ground substance and cells. (Not all authorities include blood  or lymph as connective tissue.) Blood and lymph lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.\n\nThe cells of connective tissue include fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, mast cells and leucocytes.\n\nStructure\n\nConnective tissue can be broadly subdivided into connective tissue proper, and special connective tissue.  Connective tissue proper consists of loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue (which is further subdivided into dense regular and dense irregular connective tissues.)  Special connective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue, adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood.  Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues.  New vascularised connective tissue that forms in the process of wound healing is termed granulation tissue. \nFibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of some CT.\n\nType I collagen, is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nCharacteristics of CT:\n* Cells are spread through an extracellular fluid. \n* Ground substance - A clear, colorless, and viscous fluid containing glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans to fix the body water and the collagen fibers in the intercellular spaces. Ground substance slows the spread of pathogens.\n* Fibers. Not all types of CT are fibrous. Examples of non-fibrous CT include adipose tissue and blood. Adipose tissue gives \"mechanical cushioning\" to the body, among other functions.   Although there is no dense collagen network in adipose tissue, groups of adipose cells are kept together by collagen fibers and collagen sheets in order to keep fat tissue under compression in place (for example, the sole of the foot). The matrix of blood is plasma. \n* Both the ground substance and proteins (fibers) create the matrix for CT.\n\nFunction\n\nConnective tissue has a wide variety of functions that depend on the types of cells and the different classes of fibers involved. Loose and dense irregular connective tissue, formed mainly by fibroblasts and collagen fibers, have an important role in providing a medium for oxygen and nutrients to diffuse from capillaries to cells, and carbon dioxide and waste substances to diffuse from cells back into circulation. They also allow organs to resist stretching and tearing forces. Dense regular connective tissue, which forms organized structures, is a major functional component of tendons, ligaments and aponeuroses, and is also found in highly specialized organs such as the cornea. Elastic fibers, made from elastin and fibrillin, also provide resistance to stretch forces. They are found in the walls of large blood vessels and in certain ligaments, particularly in the ligamenta flava.\n\nIn hematopoietic and lymphatic tissues, reticular fibers made by reticular cells provide the stroma\u2014or structural support\u2014for the parenchyma\u2014or functional part\u2014of the organ.\n\nMesenchyme is a type of connective tissue found in developing organs of embryos that is capable of differentiation into all types of mature connective tissue. Another type of relatively undifferentiated connective tissue is mucous connective tissue, found inside the umbilical cord.\n\nVarious type of specialized tissues and cells are classified under the spectrum of connective tissue, and are as diverse as brown and white adipose tissue, blood, cartilage and bone. Cells of the immune system, such as macrophages, mast cells, plasma cells and eosinophils are found scattered in loose connective tissue, providing the ground for starting inflammatory and immune responses upon the detection of antigens.\n\nClinical significance\n\nIt is estimated that 1 in 10 people have a connective tissue disorder.  Diseases of connective tissue include:\n\n*Connective tissue neoplasms including sarcomas such as hemangiopericytoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in nervous tissue.\n*Congenital diseases include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.\n*Myxomatous degeneration \u2013 a pathological weakening of connective tissue.\n*Mixed connective tissue disease \u2013 a disease of the autoimmune system, also undifferentiated connective tissue disease.\n*Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) \u2013 a major autoimmune disease of connective tissue\n*Scurvy, caused by a deficiency of vitamin C which is necessary for the synthesis of collagen.\n\nStaining of connective tissue\n\nFor microscopic viewing, most of the connective tissue staining-techniques, color tissue fibers in contrasting shades. Collagen may be differentially stained by any of the following:\n\n* Van Gieson's stain\n* Masson's trichrome stain\n* Mallory's trichrome stain\n* Aniline blue stain\n* Eosin\n* Reticulin stain\nQuestion:\nWhat do we call bands of flexible fibrous connective tissue that links bones together?\nAnswer:\nLigamentum\nPassage:\nDolly Parton remarries Carl Dean after 50 years: 13 crazy ...\nDolly Parton remarries Carl Dean after 50 years: 13 crazy facts about the Queen of Country | Music | Entertainment | Daily Express\nMUSIC\nDolly Parton remarries Carl Dean after 50 years: 13 crazy facts about the Queen of Country\nDOLLY PARTON has remarried hubby Carl Dean on their 50th Anniversary facts.

Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against Charles I of England and his supporters, the Cavaliers or Royalists, who claimed rule by absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings.  The goal of the Roundhead party was to give the Parliament supreme control over executive administration.\n\nMost Roundheads appear to have sought a constitutional monarchy in place of the absolutist monarchy sought by Charles I. However, at the end of the English Civil War in 1649, public antipathy towards the king was high enough to allow republican leaders such as Oliver Cromwell to abolish the monarchy completely and establish the Commonwealth of England.\n\nThe Roundhead commander-in-chief of the first Civil War, Thomas Fairfax, remained a supporter of constitutional monarchy, as did many other Roundhead leaders such as Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester and Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex; however, this party was outmanoeuvred by the more politically-adept Cromwell and his radicals, who had the backing of the New Model Army and took advantage of Charles' perceived betrayal of England by allying with the Scottish against Parliament.\n\nEngland's many Puritans and Presbyterians were almost invariably Roundhead supporters, as were many smaller religious groups such as the Independents. However many Roundheads were Church of England, as were many Cavaliers.\n\nRoundhead political factions included the proto-anarchist Diggers, the diverse group known as the Levellers and the apocalyptic Christian movement of the Fifth Monarchists.\n\nOrigins and background\n\nSome Puritans, but by no means all, wore their hair closely cropped round the head or flat and there was thus an obvious contrast between them and the men of courtly fashion, who wore long ringlets.\n\nDuring the war and for a time afterwards, Roundhead was a term of derision\u2014in the New Model Army it was a punishable offence to call a fellow soldier a Roundhead. This contrasted with the term \"Cavalier\" to describe supporters of the Royalist cause. Cavalier also started out as a pejorative term\u2014the first proponents used it to compare members of the Royalist party with Spanish Caballeros who had abused Dutch Protestants during the reign of Elizabeth I\u2014but unlike Roundhead, Cavalier was embraced by those who were the target of the epithet and used by them to describe themselves.\n\n\"Roundheads\" appears to have been first used as a term of derision toward the end of 1641, when the debates in Parliament in the Clergy Act 1640 were causing riots at Westminster. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition quotes a contemporary authority's description of the crowd gathered there: \"They had the hair of their heads very few of them longer than their ears, whereupon it came to pass that those who usually with their cries attended at Westminster were by a nickname called Roundheads\". The demonstrators included London apprentices and Roundhead was a term of derision for them because the regulations to which they had agreed included a provision for closely cropped hair.\n\nAccording to John Rushworth the word was first used on 27 December 1641 by a disbanded officer named David Hide, who during a riot is reported to have drawn his sword and said he would \"cut the throat of those round-headed dogs that bawled against bishops\". \n\nHowever, Richard Baxter ascribes the origin of the term to a remark made by Queen Henrietta Maria of France at the trial of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, earlier that year. Referring to John Pym, she asked who the roundheaded man was. The principal advisor to Charles II, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, remarked on the matter, \"and from those contestations the two terms of Roundhead and Cavalier grew to be received in discourse,\u00a0... they who were looked upon as servants to the king being then called Cavaliers, and the other of the rabble contemned and despised under the name of Roundheads.\" \n\nIronically, after Anglican Archbishop William Laud made a statute in 1636 instructing all clergy to wear short hair, many Puritans rebelled to show their contempt for his authority and began to grow their hair even longer (as can be seen on their portraits)   though they continued to be known as Roundheads. The longer hair was more common among the \"Independent\" and \"high ranking\" Puritans (which included Cromwell), especially toward the end of the Protectorate, while the \"Presbyterian\" (i.e. non-Independent) faction, and the military rank-and-file, continued to abhor long hair. By the end of this period some Independent Puritans were again derisively using the term Roundhead to refer to the Presbyterian Puritans.\n\nRoundhead remained in use to describe those with republican tendencies up until the Exclusion Crisis of 1678\u20131681; the term was then superseded by \"Whig\", initially another term with pejorative connotations. Likewise during the Exclusion Bill crisis, the term Cavalier was replaced with \"Tory\", an Irish term introduced by their opponents, and also initially a pejorative term.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWho was appointed commander-in-chief of the Parliamentary forces in the English Civil War in 1645?\nAnswer:\nThomas Fairfax\nPassage:\nJohn T. Scopes\nJohn Thomas Scopes (August 3, 1900 \u2013 October 21, 1970) was a teacher in  Dayton, Tennessee, who was charged on May 5, 1925 for violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of evolution in Tennessee schools. He was tried in a case known as the Scopes Trial, in which he was found guilty and fined $100.\n\nBiography\n\nScopes was born in 1900 on a farm in Paducah, Kentucky where he was reared before moving to Danville, Illinois as a teenager. In 1917 he moved to Salem, Illinois where he was a member of the class of 1919 at Salem High School.  He attended the University of Illinois for a short time before leaving for health reasons.  He earned a degree at the University of Kentucky in 1924, with a major in law and a minor in geology.  Scopes moved to Dayton where he took a job as the Rhea County High School's football coach and occasionally filled in as substitute teacher when regular members of the staff were off work. \n\nScopes's involvement in the so-called Scopes Monkey Trial came about after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced that it would finance a test case challenging the constitutionality of the Butler Act if they could find a Tennessee teacher willing to act as a defendant.\n\nA band of businessmen in Dayton, Tennessee, led by engineer and geologist George Rappleyea, saw this as an opportunity to get publicity for their town and approached Scopes. Rappleyea pointed out that while the Butler Act prohibited the teaching of human evolution, the state required teachers to use the assigned textbook, Hunter's Civic Biology (1914), which included a chapter on evolution. Rappleyea argued that teachers were essentially required to break the law. When asked about the test case, Scopes was initially reluctant to get involved, but after some discussion he told the group gathered in Robinson's Drugstore, \"If you can prove that I've taught evolution and that I can qualify as a defendant, then I'll be willing to stand trial.\" \n\nBy the time the trial had begun, the defense team included  Clarence Darrow, Dudley Field Malone, John Neal, Arthur Garfield Hays and Frank McElwee. The prosecution team, led by Tom Stewart, included brothers Herbert Hicks and Sue K. Hicks, Wallace Haggard, father and son pairings Ben and J. Gordon McKenzie, and William Jennings Bryan and William Jennings Bryan Jr. Bryan had spoken at Scopes's high school commencement and remembered the defendant laughing while he was giving the address to the graduating class six years earlier.\n\nThe case ended on July 21, 1925, with a guilty verdict, and Scopes was fined 100 dollars.  The case was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court.  In a 3-1 decision written by Chief Justice Grafton Green the Butler Act was held to be constitutional, but the court overturned Scopes's conviction on a technicality: the judge had set the fine instead of the jury. The Butler Act remained until May 18, 1967, when it was repealed by the Tennessee legislature.\n\nScopes may have actually been innocent of the crime to which his name is inexorably linked.  After the trial Scopes admitted to reporter William Kinsey Hutchinson \"I didn't violate the law,\" (DeCamp p.\u00a0435) explaining that he had skipped the evolution lesson, and that his lawyers had coached his students to go on the stand; the Dayton businessmen had assumed he had violated the law.  Hutchinson did not file his story until after the Scopes appeal was decided in 1927.\n\nAfter the trial Scopes accepted a scholarship for graduate study in geology at the University of Chicago. He then did geological field work in Venezuela for Gulf Oil of South America. There he met and married his wife, Mildred, and was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1930, he returned to the University of Chicago for a third year of graduate study. After two years without professional employment, he took a position as a geologist with the United Gas Corporation, for which he studied oil reserves. He worked, in Houston, Texas then in Shreveport, Louisiana, until he retired in 1963. \n\nHe died on October 21, 1970 in Shreveport, Louisiana at the age of 70.\nQuestion:\nWho was the US lawyer who defended John Scopes on charges of teaching evolution in 1925?\nAnswer:\n(Clarence) Darrow\nPassage:\nFood - Main course Savoury steamed, baked sponge & suet ...\n1000+ images about Main course Savoury steamed, baked sponge & suet puddings on Pinterest | Suet pudding, Puddings and Steak and ale\nForward\nThe Bedfordshire Clanger comes from the county of Bedfordshire.It's an elongated suet crust dumpling w/ savory filling at one end & sweet filling at the other comprising a main course & dessert in one package.The savory end is traditionally meat w/ diced potatoes & veg,the sweet end is usually jam,or sweetened apple/ fruit.Traditionally the top pasty is scored w/ a few lines to denote the sweet end.Historically,made by women for their husbands to take to their agricultural work as a midday\u2026\nSee More\nQuestion:\nWhat do we call, particular to one county, an elongated suet crust with a savoury filling at one end and a sweet filling at the other\nAnswer:\nBedfordshire Clanger\nPassage:\nWoodwind instrument\nWoodwind instruments  are a family of musical instruments within the more general category of wind instruments.  There are two main types of woodwind instruments:  flutes and reed instruments (otherwise called reed pipes). What differentiates these instruments from other wind instruments is the way in which they produce their sound.  Examples are a saxophone, a bassoon, piccolo and others.\n\nFlutes\n\nFlutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air across the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube.  The flute family can be divided into two sub-families: open flutes, and closed flutes. \n\nTo produce a sound with open flutes, the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream .  This split airstream then acts upon the air column contained within the flute's hollow causing it to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of open flutes are the transverse flute, panpipes and ocarinas.  Ancient flutes of this variety were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses, reeds, and hollowed-out tree branches. Later, flutes were made of metals such as tin, copper, or bronze. Modern concert flutes are usually made of high-grade metal alloys, usually containing nickel, silver, copper, or gold. \n\nTo produce a sound with a closed flute, the player is required to blow air into a duct.  This duct acts as a channel bringing the air to a sharp edge.  As with the open flutes, the air is then split; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of this type of flute include the recorder, and organ pipes. \n\nReed instruments\n\nReed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece which then causes a reed, or reeds, to vibrate.  Similar to flutes, Reed pipes are also further divided into two types: single reed and double reed.   \n\nSingle-reed woodwinds produce sound by placing a reed onto the opening of a mouthpiece (using a ligature).  When air is forced between the reed and the mouthpiece, the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vibrate and produce its unique sound. Single reed instruments include the clarinet, saxophone, and others such as the chalumeau.  \n\nDouble-reed instruments use two precisely cut, small pieces of cane bound together at the base.  This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period; its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush.   The finished, bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces (again, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well).   This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two sub-families: exposed double reed, and capped double reed instruments. \n \nExposed double-reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player's lips.  This family includes instruments such as the oboe, cor anglais (also called English horn) and bassoon, and many types of shawms throughout the world.\n\nOn the other hand, Capped double-reed instruments have the double reed covered by a cap.  The player  blows through a hole in this cap that then directs the air through the reeds. This family includes the crumhorn.\n\nBagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments since they use two or more double or single reeds.  However, bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double reed instruments since the reeds are never in direct contact with player's lips. \n\nFree reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by 'free reeds' \u2013  small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame.  The airflow necessary for the instruments sound is generated either by a players breath (e.g. harmonica), or by bellows (e.g. accordion).  \n\nModern orchestra and concert band woodwinds \n\nThe modern orchestra's woodwind section typically includes: flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons. The piccolo, cor anglais, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon are commonly used supplementary woodwind instruments.

For the fictional Paul B\u00e4umer, see All Quiet on the Western Front. For the late member of electronic music group Bingo Players, see Bingo Players\n\nPaul Wilhelm B\u00e4umer (11 May 1896 \u2013 15 July 1927) was a German fighter ace in World War I.\n\nBackground\n\nB\u00e4umer was born on 11 May 1896 in Duisburg, Germany. He was a dental assistant before World War I, and earned a private pilot's license by Summer 1914.Franks et al 1993, pp. 66\u201367.\n\nInvolvement in The Civil War\n\nAt the start of the war, he joined the 70th Infantry Regiment. He served in both France and Russia, being wounded in the arm in the latter. He then transferred to the air service as a dental assistant before being accepted for military pilot training.\n\nBy October 1916, he was serving as a ferry pilot and instructor at Armee Flugpark 1. On 19 February 1917, he was promoted to Gefreiter. On 26 March, he was assigned to Flieger Abteilung 7; he was promoted to Unteroffizier on the 29th.\n\nOn 15 May 1917, he was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. He subsequently received training on single-seaters, consequently being posted to fighter duty. B\u00e4umer joined Jagdstaffel 5 on 30 June 1917, scoring three victories as a balloon buster in mid-July before going to the elite Jasta Boelcke.\n\nB\u00e4umer claimed heavily, reaching 18 victories by year end.  He was commissioned in April 1918. On 29 May B\u00e4umer was injured in a crash, breaking his jaw, and he returned to the Jasta in September. With the arrival of the Fokker D.VII he claimed even more success, including 16 in September. Nicknamed \"The Iron Eagle\", he flew with a personal emblem of an Edelweiss on his aircraft. He was one of the few pilots in World War I whose lives were saved by parachute deployment, when he was shot down in flames in September. He received the Pour le M\u00e9rite shortly before the Armistice and was finally credited with 43 victories, ranking ninth among German aces.\n\nPost-War Career\n\nAfter the war, B\u00e4umer worked briefly in the dockyards before he became a dentist, and reportedly one of his patients, Erich Maria Remarque, used B\u00e4umer's name for the protagonist of his antiwar novel All Quiet on the Western Front.\n\nContinuing his interest in flying, he founded his own aircraft company in Hamburg. B\u00e4umer died in an air crash at Copenhagen on 15 July 1927, age 31, while test flying a Rohrbach Ro IX fighter.\nQuestion:\nThe young soldier Paul Baumer is the narrator and central character in which 1929 novel?\nAnswer:\nAll Quiet on the\nPassage:\nCassandra Trotter\nCassandra Louise Trotter (n\u00e9e Parry; born 16 June 1966 ) is a fictional character from the British sitcom Only Fools and Horses. She was portrayed by Gwyneth Strong.\n\nBiography\n\nThe intelligent, slightly-spoiled daughter of the owner of a successful paper merchant, Alan (Denis Lill) and his wife Pam (Wanda Ventham), Cassandra was an ambitious employee of the local bank. She made her first Only Fools and Horses appearance in the episode Yuppy Love, in which she was an attendee of Rodney's adult education class. The two first met when they accidentally mixed up their raincoats in the cloak room, and met again at a disco later that night, at which Rodney's friends Mickey Pearce and Jevon unsuccessfully ask her for a dance. Rodney then bet \u00a320 that he would be successful and, to their horror, she agreed to dance with him. Cassandra also offered to give him a lift home, and they exchanged telephone numbers. However, as he was ashamed to take her home to Nelson Mandela House, he pretended he lived in a more upmarket location on King's Avenue and was duly left stranded as it began to pour with rain, again getting their coats mixed up leaving Rodney to walk home.\n\nOriginally John Sullivan wanted to make Cassandra a girlfriend of Trigger, Denzil or an admirer of Boycie, but decided that like he planned to do with Del, Rodney needed a long term relationship.\n\nTheir relationship blossomed throughout the sixth series; In The Unlucky Winner Is... she went to Spain with Rodney and Del, and had to pretend to be Del's wife, and Rodney's stepmother. In Sickness and Wealth, Rodney announced that they were engaged; they married in the final episode of series 6: Little Problems, after which they moved into their own flat. Her marriage to Rodney was not without its problems; Rodney was envious of Cassandra's privileged upbringing and her qualifications. When Cassandra wanted to build herself a career at the bank, Rodney was outraged, as he wanted her to be little more than a housewife, and have his dinner on the table for when he got home from work.\n\nAfter a year of being married she and Rodney split up in The Jolly Boys Outing (the 1989 Christmas special), when he punched her boss and broke his nose. In the next episode aired Rodney Come Home (Christmas special 1990), they broke up again, which started an ongoing split between the pair. This split carried on throughout the duration of series 7. In The Chance of a Lunchtime Del played matchmaker between the two, reuniting them. However, the two were only together for an hour before Cassandra saw Rodney with an ex-fianc\u0113 of Del Boy's. Assuming that Rodney was cheating on her, Cassandra locked him out of the flat. They were ultimately reconciled in Three Men, a Woman and a Baby but after just getting back together they were interrupted by a phone call that Raquel had gone into labour and Del wanted Rodney to be there for the birth. The episode Miami Twice saw them trying to patch up their relationship, and in Mother Natures Son they were back together properly, and stayed together ever since. The later episodes saw them attempting to conceive a child, and Cassandra was promoted to head of small business investment at the local bank. After suffering a miscarriage in \"Modern Men\", she and Rodney later had a daughter, Joan (named after Del and Rodney's late mother), in Sleepless in Peckham.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the episode in which Rodney first met Cassandra?\nAnswer:\nYuppy Love\n\n\nPassage:\nZadok the Priest\nThe four anthems The King Shall Rejoice, My Heart is Inditing, Let thy Hand be Strengthened, and Zadok the Priest were composed by George Frideric Handel for the coronation of King George II in 1727, and are thus known as the Coronation Anthems.

This mythical bird is surrounded by folklore and legend. Read on to know about this legendary fictitious bird.\nBy Mansi Chitranshi | Saturday, February 14, 2009\nPhoenix - To Burn Itself and Rise Again From Its Ashes\nThe phoenix bird is a symbol of immortality, rebirth and afterlife. In earliest Greek and Egyptian mythology, it is linked with the sun god. As per the Greeks, Phoenix resides in Arabia, close to a cold well. Each sunrise at dawn, the sun god would stop his chariot to listen to the bird sing a melodious song while it bathed in the well.\nOnly one phoenix exists at a time. When the bird felt its death was near, every 500 to 1,461 years, it would build a nest of aromatic wood and set it on fire. The bird then was consumed by the flames.\nLegend\nThe phoenix, germinating in the legends of ancient Egypt, has become a common emblem of reincarnation and the most legendary of all magnificent birds. Covered with red and gold feathers, it carries the color of the rising sun; it had a harmonious voice that became despondent with impending bereavement. Other mortals were then so surmounted by its beauty and melancholy that they themselves fell dead.\nThe prodigy surrounding the Phoenix bird has myriad variants, with some of the most primitive accounts dating back to 8 centuries before the Christ was born. It is said that if the Phoenix is wounded, it can cure itself and enjoy a long life span.\nWhen the Phoenix gets close to the termination of its life, it's believed to build itself a nest of fragrant spices such as cinnamon and myrrh. It then sets the nest and itself on fire and is burned to ashes. Soon after, the Phoenix rises again and starts its life anew. In some customs, the new Phoenix collects the ashes of the old and takes them to Heliopolis to present them to the Sun God.\nPortrayal - What a Phoenix Looks Like\nPhoenix, as described by appearance, has the dimension of an eagle, with gold plumage around the neck, an amethyst body, and a sapphire tail. The throat has a crown, and the head has a clump of feathers.\nTraits - Some Attributes\nThe main characteristic of the phoenix is that it is reborn through fire: when it gets aged it will make a nest and put it on fire. The phoenix will envelop in the flames, but will take another life out of the ashes.  There can be only one Phoenix at a time; its life extends for many years (accounts vary from 500, 540, 1000 or 1460 years.) No one has ever seen this bird devour.  This myth was very widespread among the Egyptians, the Greek, oriental cultures, and during ancient period.\nThe Phoenix Re-emerges\nPhoenix, as they believe, is the only bird competent of restoring and reproducing its own life form. Contrasting to other birds, the Phoenix does not nourish on seeds, but on the gum of frankincense (a pungent resin) and the juices of amomum (an herb of the ginger family)\nPhoenix represents\nPhoenix is said to represent the sun, which dies ach night and take a new birth every morning. Some traditional writers also relate it with \"existing in heaven\", enjoying everlasting adolescence. Amid Christians, it signifies reincarnation.\nAlso Referred to As\nAlso called Feng-Huang- (Chinese adaptation) in this translation, the bird is sent to the world to execute astonishing tasks and to assist the development of mankind. It emerges in diverse phases of the earth's evolution, and then proceeds to heaven.\nQuestion:\nWhat mythical bird rises from its own ashes?\nAnswer:\nPh\u0153nix\nPassage:\nConnective tissue\nConnective tissue (CT) is one of the four types of biological tissue that support, connect, or separate different types of tissues and organs in the body. It develops from the mesoderm. The other three types are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and  spinal cord are composed of connective tissue.\n\nAll connective tissue apart from blood and lymph consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers),  ground substance and cells. (Not all authorities include blood  or lymph as connective tissue.) Blood and lymph lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.\n\nThe cells of connective tissue include fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, mast cells and leucocytes.\n\nStructure\n\nConnective tissue can be broadly subdivided into connective tissue proper, and special connective tissue.  Connective tissue proper consists of loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue (which is further subdivided into dense regular and dense irregular connective tissues.)  Special connective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue, adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood.  Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues.  New vascularised connective tissue that forms in the process of wound healing is termed granulation tissue. \nFibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of some CT.\n\nType I collagen, is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nCharacteristics of CT:\n* Cells are spread through an extracellular fluid. \n* Ground substance - A clear, colorless, and viscous fluid containing glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans to fix the body water and the collagen fibers in the intercellular spaces. Ground substance slows the spread of pathogens.\n* Fibers. Not all types of CT are fibrous. Examples of non-fibrous CT include adipose tissue and blood. Adipose tissue gives \"mechanical cushioning\" to the body, among other functions.   Although there is no dense collagen network in adipose tissue, groups of adipose cells are kept together by collagen fibers and collagen sheets in order to keep fat tissue under compression in place (for example, the sole of the foot). The matrix of blood is plasma. \n* Both the ground substance and proteins (fibers) create the matrix for CT.\n\nFunction\n\nConnective tissue has a wide variety of functions that depend on the types of cells and the different classes of fibers involved. Loose and dense irregular connective tissue, formed mainly by fibroblasts and collagen fibers, have an important role in providing a medium for oxygen and nutrients to diffuse from capillaries to cells, and carbon dioxide and waste substances to diffuse from cells back into circulation. They also allow organs to resist stretching and tearing forces. Dense regular connective tissue, which forms organized structures, is a major functional component of tendons, ligaments and aponeuroses, and is also found in highly specialized organs such as the cornea. Elastic fibers, made from elastin and fibrillin, also provide resistance to stretch forces. They are found in the walls of large blood vessels and in certain ligaments, particularly in the ligamenta flava.\n\nIn hematopoietic and lymphatic tissues, reticular fibers made by reticular cells provide the stroma\u2014or structural support\u2014for the parenchyma\u2014or functional part\u2014of the organ.\n\nMesenchyme is a type of connective tissue found in developing organs of embryos that is capable of differentiation into all types of mature connective tissue. Another type of relatively undifferentiated connective tissue is mucous connective tissue, found inside the umbilical cord.\n\nVarious type of specialized tissues and cells are classified under the spectrum of connective tissue, and are as diverse as brown and white adipose tissue, blood, cartilage and bone. Cells of the immune system, such as macrophages, mast cells, plasma cells and eosinophils are found scattered in loose connective tissue, providing the ground for starting inflammatory and immune responses upon the detection of antigens.\n\nClinical significance\n\nIt is estimated that 1 in 10 people have a connective tissue disorder.  Diseases of connective tissue include:\n\n*Connective tissue neoplasms including sarcomas such as hemangiopericytoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in nervous tissue.\n*Congenital diseases include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.\n*Myxomatous degeneration \u2013 a pathological weakening of connective tissue.\n*Mixed connective tissue disease \u2013 a disease of the autoimmune system, also undifferentiated connective tissue disease.\n*Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) \u2013 a major autoimmune disease of connective tissue\n*Scurvy, caused by a deficiency of vitamin C which is necessary for the synthesis of collagen.\n\nStaining of connective tissue\n\nFor microscopic viewing, most of the connective tissue staining-techniques, color tissue fibers in contrasting shades. Collagen may be differentially stained by any of the following:\n\n* Van Gieson's stain\n* Masson's trichrome stain\n* Mallory's trichrome stain\n* Aniline blue stain\n* Eosin\n* Reticulin stain\nQuestion:\nWhat do we call bands of flexible fibrous connective tissue that links bones together?\nAnswer:\nLigamentum\nPassage:\nDolly Parton remarries Carl Dean after 50 years: 13 crazy ...\nDolly Parton remarries Carl Dean after 50 years: 13 crazy facts about the Queen of Country | Music | Entertainment | Daily Express\nMUSIC\nDolly Parton remarries Carl Dean after 50 years: 13 crazy facts about the Queen of Country\nDOLLY PARTON has remarried hubby Carl Dean on their 50th Anniversary facts.

Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against Charles I of England and his supporters, the Cavaliers or Royalists, who claimed rule by absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings.  The goal of the Roundhead party was to give the Parliament supreme control over executive administration.\n\nMost Roundheads appear to have sought a constitutional monarchy in place of the absolutist monarchy sought by Charles I. However, at the end of the English Civil War in 1649, public antipathy towards the king was high enough to allow republican leaders such as Oliver Cromwell to abolish the monarchy completely and establish the Commonwealth of England.\n\nThe Roundhead commander-in-chief of the first Civil War, Thomas Fairfax, remained a supporter of constitutional monarchy, as did many other Roundhead leaders such as Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester and Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex; however, this party was outmanoeuvred by the more politically-adept Cromwell and his radicals, who had the backing of the New Model Army and took advantage of Charles' perceived betrayal of England by allying with the Scottish against Parliament.\n\nEngland's many Puritans and Presbyterians were almost invariably Roundhead supporters, as were many smaller religious groups such as the Independents. However many Roundheads were Church of England, as were many Cavaliers.\n\nRoundhead political factions included the proto-anarchist Diggers, the diverse group known as the Levellers and the apocalyptic Christian movement of the Fifth Monarchists.\n\nOrigins and background\n\nSome Puritans, but by no means all, wore their hair closely cropped round the head or flat and there was thus an obvious contrast between them and the men of courtly fashion, who wore long ringlets.\n\nDuring the war and for a time afterwards, Roundhead was a term of derision\u2014in the New Model Army it was a punishable offence to call a fellow soldier a Roundhead. This contrasted with the term \"Cavalier\" to describe supporters of the Royalist cause. Cavalier also started out as a pejorative term\u2014the first proponents used it to compare members of the Royalist party with Spanish Caballeros who had abused Dutch Protestants during the reign of Elizabeth I\u2014but unlike Roundhead, Cavalier was embraced by those who were the target of the epithet and used by them to describe themselves.\n\n\"Roundheads\" appears to have been first used as a term of derision toward the end of 1641, when the debates in Parliament in the Clergy Act 1640 were causing riots at Westminster. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition quotes a contemporary authority's description of the crowd gathered there: \"They had the hair of their heads very few of them longer than their ears, whereupon it came to pass that those who usually with their cries attended at Westminster were by a nickname called Roundheads\". The demonstrators included London apprentices and Roundhead was a term of derision for them because the regulations to which they had agreed included a provision for closely cropped hair.\n\nAccording to John Rushworth the word was first used on 27 December 1641 by a disbanded officer named David Hide, who during a riot is reported to have drawn his sword and said he would \"cut the throat of those round-headed dogs that bawled against bishops\". \n\nHowever, Richard Baxter ascribes the origin of the term to a remark made by Queen Henrietta Maria of France at the trial of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, earlier that year. Referring to John Pym, she asked who the roundheaded man was. The principal advisor to Charles II, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, remarked on the matter, \"and from those contestations the two terms of Roundhead and Cavalier grew to be received in discourse,\u00a0... they who were looked upon as servants to the king being then called Cavaliers, and the other of the rabble contemned and despised under the name of Roundheads.\" \n\nIronically, after Anglican Archbishop William Laud made a statute in 1636 instructing all clergy to wear short hair, many Puritans rebelled to show their contempt for his authority and began to grow their hair even longer (as can be seen on their portraits)   though they continued to be known as Roundheads. The longer hair was more common among the \"Independent\" and \"high ranking\" Puritans (which included Cromwell), especially toward the end of the Protectorate, while the \"Presbyterian\" (i.e. non-Independent) faction, and the military rank-and-file, continued to abhor long hair. By the end of this period some Independent Puritans were again derisively using the term Roundhead to refer to the Presbyterian Puritans.\n\nRoundhead remained in use to describe those with republican tendencies up until the Exclusion Crisis of 1678\u20131681; the term was then superseded by \"Whig\", initially another term with pejorative connotations. Likewise during the Exclusion Bill crisis, the term Cavalier was replaced with \"Tory\", an Irish term introduced by their opponents, and also initially a pejorative term.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWho was appointed commander-in-chief of the Parliamentary forces in the English Civil War in 1645?\nAnswer:\nThomas Fairfax\nPassage:\nJohn T. Scopes\nJohn Thomas Scopes (August 3, 1900 \u2013 October 21, 1970) was a teacher in  Dayton, Tennessee, who was charged on May 5, 1925 for violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of evolution in Tennessee schools. He was tried in a case known as the Scopes Trial, in which he was found guilty and fined $100.\n\nBiography\n\nScopes was born in 1900 on a farm in Paducah, Kentucky where he was reared before moving to Danville, Illinois as a teenager. In 1917 he moved to Salem, Illinois where he was a member of the class of 1919 at Salem High School.  He attended the University of Illinois for a short time before leaving for health reasons.  He earned a degree at the University of Kentucky in 1924, with a major in law and a minor in geology.  Scopes moved to Dayton where he took a job as the Rhea County High School's football coach and occasionally filled in as substitute teacher when regular members of the staff were off work. \n\nScopes's involvement in the so-called Scopes Monkey Trial came about after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced that it would finance a test case challenging the constitutionality of the Butler Act if they could find a Tennessee teacher willing to act as a defendant.\n\nA band of businessmen in Dayton, Tennessee, led by engineer and geologist George Rappleyea, saw this as an opportunity to get publicity for their town and approached Scopes. Rappleyea pointed out that while the Butler Act prohibited the teaching of human evolution, the state required teachers to use the assigned textbook, Hunter's Civic Biology (1914), which included a chapter on evolution. Rappleyea argued that teachers were essentially required to break the law. When asked about the test case, Scopes was initially reluctant to get involved, but after some discussion he told the group gathered in Robinson's Drugstore, \"If you can prove that I've taught evolution and that I can qualify as a defendant, then I'll be willing to stand trial.\" \n\nBy the time the trial had begun, the defense team included  Clarence Darrow, Dudley Field Malone, John Neal, Arthur Garfield Hays and Frank McElwee. The prosecution team, led by Tom Stewart, included brothers Herbert Hicks and Sue K. Hicks, Wallace Haggard, father and son pairings Ben and J. Gordon McKenzie, and William Jennings Bryan and William Jennings Bryan Jr. Bryan had spoken at Scopes's high school commencement and remembered the defendant laughing while he was giving the address to the graduating class six years earlier.\n\nThe case ended on July 21, 1925, with a guilty verdict, and Scopes was fined 100 dollars.  The case was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court.  In a 3-1 decision written by Chief Justice Grafton Green the Butler Act was held to be constitutional, but the court overturned Scopes's conviction on a technicality: the judge had set the fine instead of the jury. The Butler Act remained until May 18, 1967, when it was repealed by the Tennessee legislature.\n\nScopes may have actually been innocent of the crime to which his name is inexorably linked.  After the trial Scopes admitted to reporter William Kinsey Hutchinson \"I didn't violate the law,\" (DeCamp p.\u00a0435) explaining that he had skipped the evolution lesson, and that his lawyers had coached his students to go on the stand; the Dayton businessmen had assumed he had violated the law.  Hutchinson did not file his story until after the Scopes appeal was decided in 1927.\n\nAfter the trial Scopes accepted a scholarship for graduate study in geology at the University of Chicago. He then did geological field work in Venezuela for Gulf Oil of South America. There he met and married his wife, Mildred, and was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1930, he returned to the University of Chicago for a third year of graduate study. After two years without professional employment, he took a position as a geologist with the United Gas Corporation, for which he studied oil reserves. He worked, in Houston, Texas then in Shreveport, Louisiana, until he retired in 1963. \n\nHe died on October 21, 1970 in Shreveport, Louisiana at the age of 70.\nQuestion:\nWho was the US lawyer who defended John Scopes on charges of teaching evolution in 1925?\nAnswer:\n(Clarence) Darrow\nPassage:\nFood - Main course Savoury steamed, baked sponge & suet ...\n1000+ images about Main course Savoury steamed, baked sponge & suet puddings on Pinterest | Suet pudding, Puddings and Steak and ale\nForward\nThe Bedfordshire Clanger comes from the county of Bedfordshire.It's an elongated suet crust dumpling w/ savory filling at one end & sweet filling at the other comprising a main course & dessert in one package.The savory end is traditionally meat w/ diced potatoes & veg,the sweet end is usually jam,or sweetened apple/ fruit.Traditionally the top pasty is scored w/ a few lines to denote the sweet end.Historically,made by women for their husbands to take to their agricultural work as a midday\u2026\nSee More\nQuestion:\nWhat do we call, particular to one county, an elongated suet crust with a savoury filling at one end and a sweet filling at the other\nAnswer:\nBedfordshire Clanger\nPassage:\nWoodwind instrument\nWoodwind instruments  are a family of musical instruments within the more general category of wind instruments.  There are two main types of woodwind instruments:  flutes and reed instruments (otherwise called reed pipes). What differentiates these instruments from other wind instruments is the way in which they produce their sound.  Examples are a saxophone, a bassoon, piccolo and others.\n\nFlutes\n\nFlutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air across the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube.  The flute family can be divided into two sub-families: open flutes, and closed flutes. \n\nTo produce a sound with open flutes, the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream .  This split airstream then acts upon the air column contained within the flute's hollow causing it to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of open flutes are the transverse flute, panpipes and ocarinas.  Ancient flutes of this variety were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses, reeds, and hollowed-out tree branches. Later, flutes were made of metals such as tin, copper, or bronze. Modern concert flutes are usually made of high-grade metal alloys, usually containing nickel, silver, copper, or gold. \n\nTo produce a sound with a closed flute, the player is required to blow air into a duct.  This duct acts as a channel bringing the air to a sharp edge.  As with the open flutes, the air is then split; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of this type of flute include the recorder, and organ pipes. \n\nReed instruments\n\nReed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece which then causes a reed, or reeds, to vibrate.  Similar to flutes, Reed pipes are also further divided into two types: single reed and double reed.   \n\nSingle-reed woodwinds produce sound by placing a reed onto the opening of a mouthpiece (using a ligature).  When air is forced between the reed and the mouthpiece, the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vibrate and produce its unique sound. Single reed instruments include the clarinet, saxophone, and others such as the chalumeau.  \n\nDouble-reed instruments use two precisely cut, small pieces of cane bound together at the base.  This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period; its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush.   The finished, bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces (again, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well).   This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two sub-families: exposed double reed, and capped double reed instruments. \n \nExposed double-reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player's lips.  This family includes instruments such as the oboe, cor anglais (also called English horn) and bassoon, and many types of shawms throughout the world.\n\nOn the other hand, Capped double-reed instruments have the double reed covered by a cap.  The player  blows through a hole in this cap that then directs the air through the reeds. This family includes the crumhorn.\n\nBagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments since they use two or more double or single reeds.  However, bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double reed instruments since the reeds are never in direct contact with player's lips. \n\nFree reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by 'free reeds' \u2013  small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame.  The airflow necessary for the instruments sound is generated either by a players breath (e.g. harmonica), or by bellows (e.g. accordion).  \n\nModern orchestra and concert band woodwinds \n\nThe modern orchestra's woodwind section typically includes: flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons. The piccolo, cor anglais, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon are commonly used supplementary woodwind instruments. The section may also on occasion be expanded by the addition of saxophone(s).\n\nThe concert band's woodwind section is typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestra's. The concert band's woodwind section typically includes: piccolo, flutes, oboes, B clarinets, bass clarinets, bassoons, alto saxophones, tenor saxophone, and baritone saxophone. The cor anglais, E clarinet, alto clarinet, contra-alto clarinet, contrabass clarinet, contrabassoon, and soprano saxophone are also used, but not as frequently as the other woodwinds.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the largest woodwind instrument in an orchestra?\nAnswer:\nBasoon\nPassage:\nPaul B\u00e4umer\nThis article deals with Paul B\u00e4umer the pilot. For the fictional Paul B\u00e4umer, see All Quiet on the Western Front. For the late member of electronic music group Bingo Players, see Bingo Players\n\nPaul Wilhelm B\u00e4umer (11 May 1896 \u2013 15 July 1927) was a German fighter ace in World War I.\n\nBackground\n\nB\u00e4umer was born on 11 May 1896 in Duisburg, Germany. He was a dental assistant before World War I, and earned a private pilot's license by Summer 1914.Franks et al 1993, pp. 66\u201367.\n\nInvolvement in The Civil War\n\nAt the start of the war, he joined the 70th Infantry Regiment. He served in both France and Russia, being wounded in the arm in the latter. He then transferred to the air service as a dental assistant before being accepted for military pilot training.\n\nBy October 1916, he was serving as a ferry pilot and instructor at Armee Flugpark 1. On 19 February 1917, he was promoted to Gefreiter. On 26 March, he was assigned to Flieger Abteilung 7; he was promoted to Unteroffizier on the 29th.\n\nOn 15 May 1917, he was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. He subsequently received training on single-seaters, consequently being posted to fighter duty. B\u00e4umer joined Jagdstaffel 5 on 30 June 1917, scoring three victories as a balloon buster in mid-July before going to the elite Jasta Boelcke.\n\nB\u00e4umer claimed heavily, reaching 18 victories by year end.  He was commissioned in April 1918. On 29 May B\u00e4umer was injured in a crash, breaking his jaw, and he returned to the Jasta in September. With the arrival of the Fokker D.VII he claimed even more success, including 16 in September. Nicknamed \"The Iron Eagle\", he flew with a personal emblem of an Edelweiss on his aircraft. He was one of the few pilots in World War I whose lives were saved by parachute deployment, when he was shot down in flames in September. He received the Pour le M\u00e9rite shortly before the Armistice and was finally credited with 43 victories, ranking ninth among German aces.\n\nPost-War Career\n\nAfter the war, B\u00e4umer worked briefly in the dockyards before he became a dentist, and reportedly one of his patients, Erich Maria Remarque, used B\u00e4umer's name for the protagonist of his antiwar novel All Quiet on the Western Front.\n\nContinuing his interest in flying, he founded his own aircraft company in Hamburg. B\u00e4umer died in an air crash at Copenhagen on 15 July 1927, age 31, while test flying a Rohrbach Ro IX fighter.\nQuestion:\nThe young soldier Paul Baumer is the narrator and central character in which 1929 novel?\nAnswer:\nAll Quiet on the\nPassage:\nCassandra Trotter\nCassandra Louise Trotter (n\u00e9e Parry; born 16 June 1966 ) is a fictional character from the British sitcom Only Fools and Horses. She was portrayed by Gwyneth Strong.\n\nBiography\n\nThe intelligent, slightly-spoiled daughter of the owner of a successful paper merchant, Alan (Denis Lill) and his wife Pam (Wanda Ventham), Cassandra was an ambitious employee of the local bank. She made her first Only Fools and Horses appearance in the episode Yuppy Love, in which she was an attendee of Rodney's adult education class. The two first met when they accidentally mixed up their raincoats in the cloak room, and met again at a disco later that night, at which Rodney's friends Mickey Pearce and Jevon unsuccessfully ask her for a dance. Rodney then bet \u00a320 that he would be successful and, to their horror, she agreed to dance with him. Cassandra also offered to give him a lift home, and they exchanged telephone numbers. However, as he was ashamed to take her home to Nelson Mandela House, he pretended he lived in a more upmarket location on King's Avenue and was duly left stranded as it began to pour with rain, again getting their coats mixed up leaving Rodney to walk home.\n\nOriginally John Sullivan wanted to make Cassandra a girlfriend of Trigger, Denzil or an admirer of Boycie, but decided that like he planned to do with Del, Rodney needed a long term relationship.\n\nTheir relationship blossomed throughout the sixth series; In The Unlucky Winner Is... she went to Spain with Rodney and Del, and had to pretend to be Del's wife, and Rodney's stepmother. In Sickness and Wealth, Rodney announced that they were engaged; they married in the final episode of series 6: Little Problems, after which they moved into their own flat. Her marriage to Rodney was not without its problems; Rodney was envious of Cassandra's privileged upbringing and her qualifications. When Cassandra wanted to build herself a career at the bank, Rodney was outraged, as he wanted her to be little more than a housewife, and have his dinner on the table for when he got home from work.\n\nAfter a year of being married she and Rodney split up in The Jolly Boys Outing (the 1989 Christmas special), when he punched her boss and broke his nose. In the next episode aired Rodney Come Home (Christmas special 1990), they broke up again, which started an ongoing split between the pair. This split carried on throughout the duration of series 7. In The Chance of a Lunchtime Del played matchmaker between the two, reuniting them. However, the two were only together for an hour before Cassandra saw Rodney with an ex-fianc\u0113 of Del Boy's. Assuming that Rodney was cheating on her, Cassandra locked him out of the flat. They were ultimately reconciled in Three Men, a Woman and a Baby but after just getting back together they were interrupted by a phone call that Raquel had gone into labour and Del wanted Rodney to be there for the birth. The episode Miami Twice saw them trying to patch up their relationship, and in Mother Natures Son they were back together properly, and stayed together ever since. The later episodes saw them attempting to conceive a child, and Cassandra was promoted to head of small business investment at the local bank. After suffering a miscarriage in \"Modern Men\", she and Rodney later had a daughter, Joan (named after Del and Rodney's late mother), in Sleepless in Peckham.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the episode in which Rodney first met Cassandra?\nAnswer:\nYuppy Love\n", "answers": ["Zadok The Priest", "Zadok the Priest", "\"\"\"Zadok the Priest\"\"\"", "Zadoc the Priest", "Zadok the priest"], "pred": "2027?2027?2027?2027?2027?2027?2027?2027?2027?2027?2027", "length": 6710, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "797d9c3b6d2e3cff2015e914b6d110260df674aa2df7c9df"}
{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nYou Shook Me All Night Long\n\"You Shook Me All Night Long\" is a song by Australian hard rock band  AC/DC, from the album Back in Black. The song also reappeared on their later album Who Made Who. It is AC/DC's first single to feature Brian Johnson as the lead singer and reached number 35 on the USA's Hot 100 pop singles chart in 1980. The single was re-released internationally in 1986, following the release of the album Who Made Who. The re-released single in 1986 contains the B-side(s): B1. \"She's Got Balls\" (Live, Bondi Lifesaver '77); B2. \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" (Live '83 \u2013 12-inch maxi-single only).\n\n\"You Shook Me All Night Long\" placed at number 10 on VH1's list of \"The 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s\". It was also number 1 on VH1's \"Top Ten AC/DC Songs\". Guitar World placed \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" at number 80 on their \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\" list.\n\nThe song sampled Head East's \"Never Been a Reason\" guitar riff, they had opened for them early in their career.\n\nLive versions\n\nThe song has also become a staple of AC/DC concerts, and is rarely excluded from the setlist. \n\nFour live versions of the song were officially released. The first one appeared on the 1986 maxi-single \"You Shook Me All Night Long\"; the second one was included on the band's album Live; the third version is on the soundtrack to the Howard Stern movie Private Parts, and also appears on the AC/DC box set Backtracks; and the fourth one is on the band's live album, Live at River Plate.\n\n\"You Shook Me All Night Long\" was also the second song to be played by AC/DC on Saturday Night Live in 2000, following their performance of \"Stiff Upper Lip.\"  When AC/DC was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, they performed this song with Tyler. \n\nJohnson performed the song with Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden in New York, US in March 2014. The Salon publication stated on the following morning in its introduction to the video footage of the performance: \"This will either be your favorite video today, or a total musical nightmare!\" \n\nComposition \n\nThe song is in the key G major. The main verse and riff follows a G\u2013C\u2013D chord progression.\n\nMusic video \n\nTwo versions of the music video exist. The first version, directed by Eric Dionysius and Eric Mistler,  is similar to the other Back in Black videos (\"Back in Black\", \"Hells Bells\", \"What Do You Do For Money Honey\", \"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\" and \"Let Me Put My Love Into You\") and is available on the special Back in Black, The Videos. It is also included on the Backtracks box set.\n\nIn the second version, directed by David Mallet  and released six years after the song's original release, Angus and Malcolm Young follow Johnson around the English town of Huddersfield, with Angus Young wearing his signature schoolboy outfit. The video clip casts the English glamour model Corinne Russell, a former Hill's Angel and Page 3 Girl\u2014along with other leather clad women wearing suits with zips at the groin region\u2014pedaling bicycles like machines in the background.\n\nThe VH1 series Pop-Up Video revealed that, during the scene with the mechanical bull, the woman playing Johnson's lover accidentally jabbed herself with her spur twice. The roadie who came to her aid married her a year later, and Angus Young gave them a mechanical bull for a wedding present as a joke. The original 1980 video features drummer Phil Rudd, while the 1986 video features drummer Simon Wright, who replaced Rudd in 1983. Rudd returned to AC/DC in 1994.\n\nCharts and certifications\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nIn popular culture \n\n*The song was released as a vinyl single by the band Slingshot, featuring singer Kathy Kosins, in 1983\u2014the single was distributed only in the United States, Germany, Canada and Italy. \n*The song appears in the 2001 movie A Knight's Tale, starring Heath Ledger. \n*1986 horror film Maximum Overdrive's ending played this song throughout the credits.\n*Celine Dion and Anastacia performed a live duet of the song at the 2002 VH1 Divas Las Vegas concert. \n*Shania Twain covered \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" in her \"Up!

It was first released in 1971 by Harvest Records and is widely considered to be his best record. \n\nHistory\n\nThe album contains four extended songs which showcase Harper's talents, both as songwriter and guitarist. But, perhaps most significantly, Stormcock \"...epitomized a hybrid genre that had no exclusive purveyors save Harper \u2014 epic progressive acoustic.\".  The album features Jimmy Page on guitar, though upon the album's release, Page was credited as \"S. Flavius Mercurius\" for contractual reasons.\n\nAt the time, the album was not particularly well promoted by Harper's record label. Harper later stated: \n\nNonetheless, Stormcock would remain a favourite album of Harper's fans. In October 2013 NME placed Stormcock at 377 in their list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\" \n\nTitle\n\nThe album's title, Stormcock, is an old English name for the mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus). The male of this species \"is most vocal in the early morning\" and has a \"tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather\" which \"led to the old name \"stormcock\"\".  It is also, perhaps, a metaphor for Harper himself. Harper has an appreciation of birdlife and has made reference to many birds within songs on his albums.\n\nInfluence\n\n35 years after its release (2006) fellow Mancunian Johnny Marr of English alternative rock band The Smiths said: \n\nJoanna Newsom cited Stormcock as an influence upon her 2006 release Ys  and in 2011, Robin Pecknold of Seattle, Washington-based folk band Fleet Foxes stated that he took inspiration from Stormcock when recording Fleet Foxes second album Helplessness Blues.\n\nDigital remaster\n\nThe album was digitally remastered in 2007. The package included in a 20-page case-bound booklet with new pictures, prose and poetry, and Page's name was added to the album's credits.

The building started life as an ale house being close to a church where people came to pay their tithes. It was named The Bottle Inn sometime late in the 18th Century when it became the first inn in the area to sell bottled beers. During its history the building has also housed the village shop and during World War II, the village school. The  Bottle Inn was purchased as a Free House in 1982 from Ushers Brewery by Michael and Pauline Brookes. Through their hard work they built up not only the food trade but also the local trade, establishing skittle teams, dart teams, table skittle teams and domino teams. This pub has always been a popular destination for holiday makers en route to and from the coast in the summer months.  \n\nWorld Nettle Eating Championship\n\nThe Bottle Inn hosts the annual World Nettle Eating Championships as part of a charity beer festival.  Competitors are served  long stalks of stinging nettles from which they pluck and eat the leaves. After an hour the bare stalks are measured and the winner is the competitor with the greatest accumulated length of nettles. The contest began in the late 1980s when two farmers argued over who had the longest stinging nettles in their field and evolved into the World Nettle Eating Championships when one of the farmers promised to eat any nettle which was longer than his. The championship has separate men\u2019s and women\u2019s sections and attracts competitors from as far afield as Canada and Australia. \n\nIn June 2010 Sam Cunningham, a fishmonger from Somerset won the contest, after eating 74 ft of nettles. \n\nIn June 2014 Phillip Thorne, a chef from Colyton, Devon won the contest, after eating 80 ft of nettles.\nQuestion:\nThe Bottle Inn at Marshwood in Dorset has what annual eye watering and tongue numbing item on the menu?\nAnswer:\nLarge-leaved Nettle\nPassage:\nMidlands Grand National\n|}\n\n \n\nThe Midlands Grand National is a Listed National Hunt race in Great Britain. It is a handicap steeplechase and is run at Uttoxeter Racecourse in March, over a distance of 4 miles, 1 furlong and 110 yards.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first race was run on 3 May 1969.  The race was initially run over 4m2f and was increased up to 4m4f in 1977. During this period it would have been, assuming accurate measurements, by 24 yards or approximately the length of a cricket pitch, the longest race in the NH calendar.

Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films,  etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry.  Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.\n\nSimilar literary devices\n\nMonologues are similar to poems, epiphanies, and others in that they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.  Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.  Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a dialogue interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).\n\nHistory\n\nIn ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama, the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.  The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.\n\nAncient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.  One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.  Other monologue types included \"entrance monologues\" and exit monologues.  In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.\n\nFrom Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches. \u00d7\u2192\u2192\n\nTypes of monologues\n\nInterior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.  Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense. \n\nAudition monologues\n\nActors in theatre and sometimes in film and television may be called upon to use monologues for audition purposes. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.  These pieces are usually relegated to two minutes (sometimes less) and are often paired with a contrasting monologue. This can be a comic monologue paired with a dramatic monologue or it can mean classical paired with contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition can often depend on the play in question or the role the actor wants to land. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors and a tradition that continues today.\nQuestion:\nWhich word describes a monologue where an actor addresses an audience by speaking his thoughts aloud?\nAnswer:\nSoliloquy\nPassage:\nCliffs of Moher\nThe Cliffs of Moher ()  are located at the southwestern edge of the Burren region in County Clare, Ireland.   They rise 120 m above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag's Head and reach their maximum height of 214 m just north of O'Brien's Tower, eight kilometres to the north.  A round stone tower near the midpoint of the cliffs was built in 1835 by Sir Cornelius O'Brien.  From the cliffs and from atop the tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. The cliffs rank amongst the top-visited tourist sites in Ireland  and receive almost one million visitors a year. The closest settlements are Liscannor (6\u00a0km south) and Doolin (7\u00a0km north).\n\nName\n\nThe cliffs take their name from an old fort called Moher, which once stood on Hag's Head, the southernmost point of the cliffs. The writer Thomas Johnson Westropp referred to it in 1905 as Moher U\u00ed Ruis or Moher U\u00ed Ruidhin.  The fort still stood in 1780 and is mentioned in an account from John Lloyd's A Short Tour Of Clare (1780).  It was demolished in 1808 to provide material for a new telegraph tower. The present tower near the site of the old Moher U\u00ed Ruidhin was built as a lookout tower during the Napoleonic wars. \n\nTourism\n\nThe cliffs are one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland and topped the list of attractions in 2006 by drawing almost one million visitors.  Since 2011, they have formed a part of the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark, one of a family of geotourism destinations throughout Europe that are members of the European Geoparks Network. \n\nIn the 1990s, Clare County Council initiated development plans to enable visitors to experience the cliffs without significant intrusive man-made amenities. In keeping with this approach, the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience was built into a hillside approaching the cliffs. The centre is also intended to be environmentally sensitive in its use of renewable energy systems including geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels, and grey water recycling. \n\nThe \u20ac32 million facility was planned and built over a 17-year period and officially opened in February 2007. Facility exhibits include interactive media displays covering the geology, history, flora and fauna of the cliffs. A large multimedia screen displays a bird's-eye view from the cliffs, as well as video from the underwater caves below the cliffs. \n\nThe visitor's centre charges \u20ac6 per adult, with children under 16 admitted free. This covers parking, access to the visitor centre and Atlantic Edge exhibition, and a contribution towards conservation and safety at the cliffs. \n\nThe Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience won an award in the Interpret Britain & Ireland Awards 2007 awarded by the Association of Heritage Interpretation (AHI).  Although the award was specifically for the Atlantic Edge exhibition, the AHI assessed the entire visitor centre and site. The citation stated that the entire visitor centre was \"one of the best facilities that the judges had ever seen.\" \n\nSeparate ferry trips also allow tourists to view the cliffs from sea level. \n\nGeology and wildlife\n\nThe cliffs consist mainly of beds of Namurian shale and sandstone,  with the oldest rocks being found at the bottom of the cliffs. It is possible to see 300-million-year-old river channels cutting through, forming unconformities at the base of the cliffs.\n\nThere are an estimated 30,000 birds living on the cliffs, representing more than 20 species.  These include Atlantic puffins, which live in large colonies at isolated parts of the cliffs and on the small Goat Island, and razorbills.\nThe site is an Important Bird Area. \n\nPopular culture\n\nThe Cliffs of Moher have appeared in numerous media. In cinema, the cliffs have appeared in several films, including The Princess Bride (1987) (as the filming location for \"The Cliffs of Insanity\"), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009),  and Leap Year (2010).  The cliffs are mentioned in the Martin Scorsese film Bringing Out the Dead (1999) and are noted in the 2008 documentary Waveriders as the location of a large surfing wave known as \"Aileens\". \n\nIn music, the cliffs have appeared in music videos, including Maroon 5's \"Runaway\" video, Westlife's \"My Love\", and Rich Mullins' \"The Color Green\". Most of singer Dusty Springfield's ashes were scattered at the cliffs by her brother, Tom.  Gaelic Storm's song \"Green Eyes Red Hair\" references the cliffs. \n\nIn television, the cliffs appear in the episodes of Father Ted called \"Tentacles of Doom\" and \"Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading\" (1996).\n\nIn literature, the cliffs are an important location in Anthony Trollope's An Eye for an Eye, and in Eoin Colfer's The Wish List.\n\nTransport\n\nBus \u00c9ireann route 350 links the Cliffs of Moher to several locations: Ennis, Ennistymon, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna, Kinvara and Galway. This service includes a number of journeys each way daily. There is also a privately operated shuttle bus that serves the site from Doolin. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Pano 4184 -1024-Cliffs of Moher.jpg|A wide perspective\nFile:MoherView1.jpg|A 200-metre drop\nFile:Moher01(js).jpg|The cliffs from the sea\nFile:Moher11(js).jpg|Local feral Bilberry goats\nFile:Branaunmore-Moher-2012.JPG|Branaunmore sea stack\nFile:View of Cliffs of Moher.jpg|Looking south over the Cliffs of Moher\nFile:Cliffs_of_moher_33mp.jpg|Panorama from below O'Brien's Tower\nQuestion:\nIn which Irish county would you find the Cliffs of Moher?\nAnswer:\nClare\nPassage:\nClaret Jug\nThe Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug, is the trophy presented to the winner of The Open Championship, (often called the \"British Open\"), one of the four major championships in golf.\n\nThe awarding of the Claret Jug dates from 1872, when a new trophy was needed after Young Tom Morris had won the original Challenge Belt (presented by Prestwick Golf Club) outright in 1870 by winning the Championship three years in a row. Prestwick had both hosted and organised the Championship from 1860 to 1870.\n\nBy the time that Prestwick had reached agreement with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (based at Musselburgh) for the championship to rotate at these three venues, more than a year had passed. So, there was no event in 1871.\n\nEach club contributed \u00a310 to the cost of the new trophy, which is inscribed 'The Golf Champion Trophy', and was made by Mackay Cunningham & Company of Edinburgh.\n\nWhen the 1872 event was played, the trophy still wasn't ready in time to be presented to Morris (who had won his fourth in a row) although his name was the first to be engraved on it. In 1872, Morris was presented with a medal as have all subsequent winners.\n\nIn 1873 Tom Kidd became the first winner to be actually presented with the Claret Jug after winning the Championship.\n\nThe original Claret Jug has been on permanent display at the clubhouse of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews since 1928. The original Challenge Belt is also on display at the same site, having been donated in 1908 by the Morris family.\n\nThe current Claret Jug was first awarded to Walter Hagen for winning the 1928 Open. The winner must return the trophy before the next year's Open, and receives a replica to keep permanently. Three other replicas exist \u2014 one in the British Museum of Golf at St Andrews, and two used for travelling exhibitions.\n\nEvery year, the winner's name is engraved on the Claret Jug before it is presented to him. The BBC always shows the engraver poised to start work, and the commentators like to speculate about when he will be sure enough of the outcome to begin. However, at the 1999 Open Championship, Jean van de Velde's name was engraved on the trophy before he famously choked with a triple-bogey on the 18th hole and Paul Lawrie subsequently won the playoff. Upon being awarded the Jug in 1989, Mark Calcavecchia said, \"How's my name going to fit on that thing?\" \n\nThe Claret Jug has twice appeared on commemorative \u00a35 Scottish banknotes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland: first in 2004, for the 250th Anniversary of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, then in 2005, the jug is shown held by Jack Nicklaus to mark his retirement.\nQuestion:\nThe Claret Jug is awarded to the winner of which competition?\nAnswer:\nOpen Golf Championship\nPassage:\nBallinasloe\nBallinasloe ()  is a town in the easternmost part of County Galway in Ireland. It is regarded as the largest town in County Galway with a population of 7,674, which includes Ballinasloe Urban and Ballinasloe Rural.\n\nName and history\n\nThe town developed as a crossing point on the River Suck, a tributary of the Shannon. The Irish placename \u2013 meaning the mouth of the ford of the crowds \u2013 reflects this purpose. The latter part of the name suggests the town has been a meeting place since ancient times. The patron saint of Ballinasloe is Saint Grellan, whom tradition believes built the first church in the area at Kilcloony. A local housing estate, a GAA club, the branch of Conradh na Gaeilge, and formerly a school are named after him.\n\nSupermacs opened their first store there and there is now four stores open.\n\nOctober Fair and Festival\n\nEvery October, Ballinasloe is host to the ancient annual October Fair. Chiefly agricultural in the past, it is now focused on the horse. The Ballinasloe Fair is one of the oldest horse fairs in Europe; bathed in history it dates back to the 18th century. Today the ever popular fair is still held, along with a festival that attracts up to 100,000 visitors from all over the world. The town also boasts a successful summer festival called An tS\u00faca Fiain.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe biggest local employers are Portiuncula and St. Brigid's hospitals. The Dubarry shoe manufacturing company has been based in the town, although manufacturing at the plant ceased in November 2004.  The American pen manufacturing company A. T. Cross had a factory in the town for many years as did electrical components company Square D.\n\nBallinasloe like much of rural Ireland enjoyed a period of growth and expansion in the 2000s, thanks to the \"Celtic Tiger\" economic boom. However the town has suffered since the financial crash of 2008 and like many small towns in the region, it has seen a brain drain of the youth and educated.\n\nBusinesses and shops face competition from larger towns such as Athlone and Galway City.\n\nAs of 2015, employment in the town centres around its hotels, hospital and factories.\n\nNotable people\n\n*Denis Delaney, piper\n*John Feeley, classical guitarist\n*Patrick Green VC\n*Desmond Hogan, writer\n*Noel Mannion, , rugby player\n*Ray McLoughlin, rugby player\n*Se\u00e1n na Maighe \u00d3 Cellaigh, petty chief\n*John O'Connor Power, politician\n*Eoghan \u00d3 Tuairisc, poet and writer\n\nTransport\n\nBallinasloe railway station opened on 1 August 1851,  and is served by the Dublin\u2013Galway railway line. Once a notorious bottleneck on the old Galway to Dublin road, on 18 December 2009, the town was officially bypassed for the first time, when the M6 motorway opened as an upgrade to the N6.\nFrom 1828 to the 1960s, Ballinasloe was the terminus of the Grand Canal. Guinness Company used the town's canal stores to store and distribute the Guinness to the midlands. Grand Canal provided an easy route for Guinness barges to travel from Dublin to Shannon Harbour. A new public marina has been developed on the river in recent years that allows traffic from the Shannon navigation to access the town.\n\nLocal Media\n\nA number of newspapers circulate in the Ballinasloe area, such as Ballinasloe Life magazine, the Connacht Tribune, Galway Advertiser, Athlone Topic and the Roscommon Herald. As Ballinasloe sits on the border between two counties it is served by 2 local radio stations, Galway Bay FM and Shannonside FM. Local radio from other neighbouring counties such as Midlands 103 and Tipp FM are well received in the area. National stations in the area include RT\u00c9 Radio 1, 2FM, RT\u00c9 Lyric FM, Today FM, and 4FM.\n\nSport\n\nBallinasloe itself harbours historically rich soccer, golf, and rugby clubs, alongside Duggan Park Gaelic Athletic Association grounds. The local GAA clubs are Ballinasloe GAA (incorporating St Grellan's Gaelic football club and the Ballinasloe Hurling Club), Derrymullen Handball Club and Ballinasloe Camogie Club. Ballinasloe has a boxing tradition as well, and two resident boxing clubs.\n\nSchools\n\nIn Ballinasloe there are four national schools (Scoil U\u00ed Cheithearnaigh, Creagh National School,    [http://www.stteresas.ie St Teresa's Special School] and Scoil an Chro\u00ed Naofa) and two secondary schools (St Joseph's College, Garbally and Ard Scoil Mhuire).\n\nTwin towns\n\nChalonnes-sur-Loire, Maine-et-Loire, France.

Napa Valley is by far the most valuable appellation in the U.S. and that explains the fuss over the delimits of its borders.The official boundaries eventually included 16 sub-regions, some of which (Carneros, Chiles) lie outside the geographic valley itself. Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon fetches the highest prices of any American wine, so it\u2019s no surprise that the valley represents 25 percent of California\u2019s wine revenues. Any wine of any variety is easier to sell with \u201cNapa Valley\u201d on the label, but enhanced value comes with sub-regional names, such as: Diamond Mountain, Howell Mountain, Oakville, Mt Veeder, Rutherford, Spring Mountain, and Stags Leap.

Official  cheese is to be aged for between 60 days and two years.\n\n has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture, and often contains small, unevenly distributed air pockets. The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige. The cheese has a distinctive flavour, well-developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy, and leaves an aftertaste that is characteristic of sheep\u2019s milk.\n\nThe designation  is protected under Spain's Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen (DO) regulatory classification system,  and the cheese has been granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European Union. \n\nPDO requirements\n\nTo be designated as , the cheese must satisfy the following requirements: \n* It must have been produced in an area that is restricted to designated parts of the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca and Toledo that lie within the La Mancha region.\n* It can be made only with the whole milk of sheep of the  breed that are raised on registered farms within the designated area.\n* The cheese must have been aged for a minimum of 60 days (30 days for cheeses weighing up to 1.5\u00a0kg) and a maximum of two years.\n* The cheese must be produced by pressing in a cylindrical mould that has a maximum height of 12\u00a0cm and a maximum diameter of 22\u00a0cm.\n\n cheese can be made from pasteurised or raw milk; if the latter, it may be labelled as  (artisan). The only permitted additives are natural rennet or another approved coagulating enzyme, and sodium chloride (salt).\n\nManufacture and labeling\n\nThe moulds in which the cheese is pressed are barrel-shaped. Traditionally,  cheese was made by pressing the curd in plaited esparto grass baskets, which left a distinctive zig-zag pattern (known as ) on the rind.  Today the same effect is achieved by the mould, the inside of which has a design in relief that imparts to the finished cheese an embossed pattern similar to that of woven esparto grass. The top and bottom surfaces of the cheese are impressed with a design of an ear of wheat.\n\nDuring the maturation process, manchego cheese develops a natural rind. The regulations permit this to be washed, coated in paraffin, dipped in olive oil, or treated with certain approved transparent substances, but require that it must not be removed if the cheese is to be marketed as PDO.\n\nCheeses that meet the DO requirements carry a casein tab that is applied when the cheese is in the mould and bear a distinctive label that is issued by the Manchego Cheese Denomination of Origin Regulating Council; this carries the legend , a serial number, and artwork depicting Don Quixote de La Mancha. \n\nA cheese that is similar to  and made in the same region, but from a blend of cow's, goat's, and ewe's milk, is sold as  or  cheese.\n\nVarieties\n\n has variety of different flavours depending on its age. There are four versions of maturity sold: \n\n*  \u2013 the fresh cheese is aged for only 2 weeks, with a rich but mild flavour. Produced in small quantities, it is rarely found outside Spain.\n*   is a semi-firm cheese aged for three weeks to three months, somewhat milder than curado.\n*  is a semi-firm cheese aged for three to six months with a sweet and nutty flavor.\n* , aged for one year is firm with a sharper flavour the longer it is aged and a rich deep pepperiness to it. It grates well, but can also be eaten on its own or as tapas. \n\nAmerica\n\nNorth America\n\nIn Mexico and Spanish-speaking areas of the United States,  or  (manchego-type cheese) is the name given to a cow's milk cheese similar in taste to Monterey Jack. It melts well and is often used in quesadillas. Apart from the name, this cheese has little in common with the Spanish variety. \n\nCentral America\n\nIn Costa Rica, two companies (Dos Pinos and Los Alpes ) \nproduce a manchego-type cheese (queso tipo manchego) which can come with a drawing of Don Quijote on the labels. One company also makes a manchego-type cheese with basil added. These Costa-Rican cheeses can come dipped in paraffin, and some have the  pattern pressed on the side.\nQuestion:\nFrom which country does the cheese `Manchego' come?\nAnswer:\nIslands of Spain\nPassage:\nWelshpool\nWelshpool () is a town in Wales, historically in the county of Montgomeryshire, but currently administered as part of the unitary authority of Powys. The town is 4 mi from the Wales\u2013England border and low-lying on the River Severn; its Welsh language name Y Trallwng literally means \"the marshy or sinking land\". Welshpool is the fourth largest town in Powys.\n\nIn English it was initially known as Pool but its name was changed to Welshpool in 1835 to distinguish it from the English town of Poole.  It has a population of 6,664 (United Kingdom Census 2011), contains much Georgian architecture and is just north of Powis Castle.\n\nHistory\n\nSt Cynfelin (he is also known as St Matu) is reputed to be the founder of the church of St Mary's and St Cynfelin's in the town during \"the age of the saints in Wales\" in the 5th and 6th centuries.\n\nThe parish of Welshpool roughly coincides with the medieval commote of Ystrad Marchell in the cantref of Ystlyg in the Kingdom of Powys.\n\nThe Long Mountain, which plays as a backdrop to most of Welshpool, once served as the ultimate grounds for defence for fortresses in the times when the town was just a swampy marsh. Welshpool served briefly as the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn or South Powys after its prince was forced to flee the traditional Welsh royal site at Mathrafal in 1212. After 1284 Powys Wenwynwyn ceased to exist. \n\nThe town was devastated by the forces of Owain Glynd\u0175r in 1400 at the start of his rebellion against the English king Henry IV. Today the waymarked long-distance footpath and National Trail Glynd\u0175r's Way runs through the town.\n\nIn 1411 the priest at the church St Mary's and St Cynfelin's was Adam of Usk.\n\nHistoric buildings\n\nThe Mermaid Inn, 28 High Street, was very probably an early 16th century merchant\u2019s house, placed on a burgage plot between the High Street and Alfred Jones Court. The timber-ramed building has long storehouse or wing to the rear. The frontage was remodelled  1890, by Frank H. Shayler, architect, of Shrewsbury. Early illustrations of the building show that prior to this it had a thatched roof and that the timbering was not exposed. There is a passage to side with heavy box-framing in square panels, with brick infill exposed in side elevation and in rear wing. The frontage was exposed by Shayler to show decorative timber work on the upper storey. An Inn by the 19th century when it was owned by a family named Sparrow. \n  \n\nThere is an octagonal brick cockpit in New Street, which was built in the early 18th century and was in continual use for cockfighting until the practice was outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849.  , it is the home of the town's Women's Institute.\n\nTransport\n\nWelshpool railway station is on the Cambrian Line and is served by Arriva Trains Wales. The town is also the starting point of the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway, a narrow-gauge heritage railway popular with tourists, with its terminus station at Raven Square. The light railway once ran through the town to the Cambrian Line railway station, but today Raven Square, located on the western edge of the town, is the eastern terminus of the line.\n\nA small network of bus services link surrounding towns and villages, mainly operated by Tanat Valley Coaches. Notable is service No X75, serving Shrewsbury to the east and Newtown and Llanidloes to the south west, also service No D71 to Oswestry via Guilsfield and Llanymynech. In addition there is a local town service operated by Owen's Coaches. The semi-disused Montgomery Canal also runs through Welshpool. To the south of the town is Welshpool Airport which is also known as the Mid Wales Airport.  Three major trunk roads pass through Welshpool: the A458, A483 and the A490.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe local economy is primarily based upon agriculture and local industry. The Smithfield Livestock Market is the largest one-day sheep market in Europe, whilst the town's industrial estates are home to numerous different types of small industry.\nDue to the town's small size and population the attraction of high street stores is limited, meaning many of the residents are forced to shop in neighbouring towns like Newtown and Shrewsbury.\n\nEducation\n\nThe town is the home of Ardwyn Nursery and Infants School, Oldford Nursery and Infants School, Gungrog Nursery and Infants School, Maes-y-dre Primary School and Welshpool High School is a secondary school which teaches a range of pupils from ages 11\u201318 and is consistently set to a very high standard of education throughout Key Stage 3 and 4 and A Level studies.\n\nSport\n\nWelshpool has a football club and a rugby union club, the former being Welshpool Town F.C. and the latter, Welshpool Rugby Football Club. The town also has hockey and cricket clubs. The Montgomeryshire Marauders Rugby League Club are also nominally based in Welshpool, as this is where the majority of their home fixtures take place.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nOn which river is the market town of Welshpool?\nAnswer:\nSeven Boar\nPassage:\nSt. Gallen\u2013Altenrhein Airport\nSt. Gallen\u2013Altenrhein Airport  is a small airport in Altenrhein in the Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland near Lake Constance. It is also known under its trading name People's Business Airport  and is the home base for People's Viennaline.\n\nHistory\n\nAt the end of World War II, Swiss authorities identified existing locations that were to be modernized as regional airports, a second tier of infrastructure to support the primary urban airports, with St. Gallen-Altenrhein being one of the five. \n\nAustrian Airlines served St. Gallen-Altenrhein from Vienna since 2003 when it took over the route from Rheintalflug, a predecessor of InterSky. The airport decided to terminate the contracts with Austrian in 2011 and started their own airline, People's Viennaline, to serve the route. Austrian decided to continue the route as well in direct competition. As a result, there were up to six daily flights from the small airport to Vienna during that period. In spring 2013, Austrian announced the termination of their route to Vienna due to continuing losses as a result of the harsh competition.  After that, People's offered a codeshare agreement to Austrian, which they declined. \n\nFacilities\n\nTerminal\n\nThe airport features a small passenger terminal building and some apron and hangar stands for aircraft such as the Embraer 170, business jets or general aviation planes such as the Cessna 172. As there are no jet bridges, walk-boarding is used.\n\nRunway\n\nThe paved, eastbound runway 10 is equipped with an Instrument landing system (ILS CAT I).  Due to its short length the main runway can only be used by smaller passenger aircraft such as the Embraer E-Jets or the Bombardier Q Series.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nThe following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at St. Gallen\u2013Altenrhein Airport: \n\nThe nearest bigger airport is Friedrichshafen Airport in Germany, on the opposite side of Lake Constance 45 km to the northwest by ferry.\n\nGround transportation\n\nThe airport can be reached via motorway A1 (Z\u00fcrich - Winterthur, Exit Rheineck-Thal). Taxis and a shuttle service are available. There is also a scheduled bus connection from the airport to the nearby towns of Rorschach and Rheineck and their railway stations.\nQuestion:\nSt Gallen Airport is in which European country?\nAnswer:\nISO 3166-1:CH\nPassage:\nRingo Kid\nThe Ringo Kid  is a fictional Western hero in the Marvel Comics' universe, whose comic book series was originally released by the company's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics. A lesser-known character than the company's Kid Colt, Rawhide Kid, or Two-Gun Kid, he also appeared in a reprint series in the 1970s.\n\nThe character is unrelated to the actor John Wayne's \"Ringo Kid\" in the Western film Stagecoach.\n\nPublication history\n\nAtlas Comics' Ringo Kid debuted in the first issue of a series billed on its trademarked cover logo as Ringo Kid for all but two issues (#1 and #3, cover-billed as Ringo Kid Western).  Created by an unknown writer and artist Joe Maneely, it ran 21 issues (cover-dated Aug. 1954 - Sept. 1957), drawn primarily by either Maneely or Fred Kida. Stories also ran occasionally in Wild Western, beginning with issue #38 (Nov. 1954), initially drawn by Maneely, with artist John Severin taking the reins in at least issues #46-47 (Nov. 1955 - Jan. 1956). Ringo was the lead feature in the two-issue anthology series Western Trails #1-2 (May & July 1957).   He also appears on the cover of Wild Western #39 (Dec. 1954), but not in an interior story.  \n\nA five-page story entitled \"The Ringo Kid\" in Atlas' Western Outlaws & Sheriffs #73 (June 1952) is unrelated,  as is the four-page story \"Ringo Kid\" in Wild Western #26 (Feb. 1953). \n\nMarvel reprinted the series in Ringo Kid vol. 2, #1-30 (Jan. 1970 - Nov. 1976), often with the original Maneely covers. The Ringo Kid made his first appearance in present-day stories in a time travel tale in the superhero-team comic The Avengers #142 (Dec. 1975)\n\nMarvel writer Steve Englehart planned a revival series at about this time, with art by Dick Ayers: \"Every series I did took off so Marvel kept giving me more. I relaunched this classic Western \u2014 always my favorite of Marvel's true cowboy heroes (as opposed to the Two-Gun Kid, whom I also liked but who was more a superhero) \u2014 with classic Western artist Dick Ayres [sic]. But after this first issue was drawn and scripted, Marvel decided to do more superheroes and fewer cowboys, so it was set aside before inking\". \n\nFictional character biography\n\nThe Ringo Kid, dressed all in black, is a heroic gunslinger of the 19th-century American Old West with a Caucasian father, Cory Rand, and a Native American mother, Dawn Star, variously referred to as a Comanche or a Cheyenne \"princess of her tribe despite the fact that the very idea of princesses was alien to that culture, imagined by settlers of European extraction, projecting their notions of royalty onto the natives.\" He was treated as an outcast because of his mixed heritage, and on the run after being falsely accused of a crime. With his sidekick Dull Knife, of his mother's people, he roamed the frontier atop his horse, Arab. His specific mission or goal appears not to have been stated explicitly, but there is intimation of some law-enforcement function: As many covers note breathlessly, \"Ringo!\" is \"The name that makes killers tremble!\"\nQuestion:\nWho played the Ringo Kid in the 1938 film 'Stagecoach'?\nAnswer:\nMichael Morris (John Wayne)\n\n\nPassage:\nMoby Dick (1956) - IMDb\nMoby Dick (1956) - IMDb\nIMDb\nThere was an error trying to load your rating for this title.\nSome parts of this page won't work property.

The song also reappeared on their later album Who Made Who. It is AC/DC's first single to feature Brian Johnson as the lead singer and reached number 35 on the USA's Hot 100 pop singles chart in 1980. The single was re-released internationally in 1986, following the release of the album Who Made Who. The re-released single in 1986 contains the B-side(s): B1. \"She's Got Balls\" (Live, Bondi Lifesaver '77); B2. \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" (Live '83 \u2013 12-inch maxi-single only).\n\n\"You Shook Me All Night Long\" placed at number 10 on VH1's list of \"The 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s\". It was also number 1 on VH1's \"Top Ten AC/DC Songs\". Guitar World placed \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" at number 80 on their \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\" list.\n\nThe song sampled Head East's \"Never Been a Reason\" guitar riff, they had opened for them early in their career.\n\nLive versions\n\nThe song has also become a staple of AC/DC concerts, and is rarely excluded from the setlist. \n\nFour live versions of the song were officially released. The first one appeared on the 1986 maxi-single \"You Shook Me All Night Long\"; the second one was included on the band's album Live; the third version is on the soundtrack to the Howard Stern movie Private Parts, and also appears on the AC/DC box set Backtracks; and the fourth one is on the band's live album, Live at River Plate.\n\n\"You Shook Me All Night Long\" was also the second song to be played by AC/DC on Saturday Night Live in 2000, following their performance of \"Stiff Upper Lip.\"  When AC/DC was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, they performed this song with Tyler. \n\nJohnson performed the song with Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden in New York, US in March 2014. The Salon publication stated on the following morning in its introduction to the video footage of the performance: \"This will either be your favorite video today, or a total musical nightmare!\" \n\nComposition \n\nThe song is in the key G major. The main verse and riff follows a G\u2013C\u2013D chord progression.\n\nMusic video \n\nTwo versions of the music video exist. The first version, directed by Eric Dionysius and Eric Mistler,  is similar to the other Back in Black videos (\"Back in Black\", \"Hells Bells\", \"What Do You Do For Money Honey\", \"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\" and \"Let Me Put My Love Into You\") and is available on the special Back in Black, The Videos. It is also included on the Backtracks box set.\n\nIn the second version, directed by David Mallet  and released six years after the song's original release, Angus and Malcolm Young follow Johnson around the English town of Huddersfield, with Angus Young wearing his signature schoolboy outfit. The video clip casts the English glamour model Corinne Russell, a former Hill's Angel and Page 3 Girl\u2014along with other leather clad women wearing suits with zips at the groin region\u2014pedaling bicycles like machines in the background.\n\nThe VH1 series Pop-Up Video revealed that, during the scene with the mechanical bull, the woman playing Johnson's lover accidentally jabbed herself with her spur twice. The roadie who came to her aid married her a year later, and Angus Young gave them a mechanical bull for a wedding present as a joke. The original 1980 video features drummer Phil Rudd, while the 1986 video features drummer Simon Wright, who replaced Rudd in 1983. Rudd returned to AC/DC in 1994.\n\nCharts and certifications\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nIn popular culture \n\n*The song was released as a vinyl single by the band Slingshot, featuring singer Kathy Kosins, in 1983\u2014the single was distributed only in the United States, Germany, Canada and Italy. \n*The song appears in the 2001 movie A Knight's Tale, starring Heath Ledger. \n*1986 horror film Maximum Overdrive's ending played this song throughout the credits.\n*Celine Dion and Anastacia performed a live duet of the song at the 2002 VH1 Divas Las Vegas concert. \n*Shania Twain covered \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" in her \"Up!

It was first released in 1971 by Harvest Records and is widely considered to be his best record. \n\nHistory\n\nThe album contains four extended songs which showcase Harper's talents, both as songwriter and guitarist. But, perhaps most significantly, Stormcock \"...epitomized a hybrid genre that had no exclusive purveyors save Harper \u2014 epic progressive acoustic.\".  The album features Jimmy Page on guitar, though upon the album's release, Page was credited as \"S. Flavius Mercurius\" for contractual reasons.\n\nAt the time, the album was not particularly well promoted by Harper's record label. Harper later stated: \n\nNonetheless, Stormcock would remain a favourite album of Harper's fans. In October 2013 NME placed Stormcock at 377 in their list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\" \n\nTitle\n\nThe album's title, Stormcock, is an old English name for the mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus). The male of this species \"is most vocal in the early morning\" and has a \"tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather\" which \"led to the old name \"stormcock\"\".  It is also, perhaps, a metaphor for Harper himself. Harper has an appreciation of birdlife and has made reference to many birds within songs on his albums.\n\nInfluence\n\n35 years after its release (2006) fellow Mancunian Johnny Marr of English alternative rock band The Smiths said: \n\nJoanna Newsom cited Stormcock as an influence upon her 2006 release Ys  and in 2011, Robin Pecknold of Seattle, Washington-based folk band Fleet Foxes stated that he took inspiration from Stormcock when recording Fleet Foxes second album Helplessness Blues.\n\nDigital remaster\n\nThe album was digitally remastered in 2007. The package included in a 20-page case-bound booklet with new pictures, prose and poetry, and Page's name was added to the album's credits. The album also showcases David Bedford's orchestral arrangements (Bedford would also collaborate on some of Harper's later releases).\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll tracks credited to Roy Harper\n\nSide one\n\n#\"Hors d'\u0153uvres\" \u2013 8:37\n#\"The Same Old Rock\" \u2013 12:24\n\nSide two\n\n#\"One Man Rock and Roll Band\" \u2013 7:23\n#\"Me and My Woman\" \u2013 13:01\n\nPersonnel\n\n*Roy Harper \u2013 guitar six and twelve strings, vocals, piano\n*S.

The building started life as an ale house being close to a church where people came to pay their tithes. It was named The Bottle Inn sometime late in the 18th Century when it became the first inn in the area to sell bottled beers. During its history the building has also housed the village shop and during World War II, the village school. The  Bottle Inn was purchased as a Free House in 1982 from Ushers Brewery by Michael and Pauline Brookes. Through their hard work they built up not only the food trade but also the local trade, establishing skittle teams, dart teams, table skittle teams and domino teams. This pub has always been a popular destination for holiday makers en route to and from the coast in the summer months.  \n\nWorld Nettle Eating Championship\n\nThe Bottle Inn hosts the annual World Nettle Eating Championships as part of a charity beer festival.  Competitors are served  long stalks of stinging nettles from which they pluck and eat the leaves. After an hour the bare stalks are measured and the winner is the competitor with the greatest accumulated length of nettles. The contest began in the late 1980s when two farmers argued over who had the longest stinging nettles in their field and evolved into the World Nettle Eating Championships when one of the farmers promised to eat any nettle which was longer than his. The championship has separate men\u2019s and women\u2019s sections and attracts competitors from as far afield as Canada and Australia. \n\nIn June 2010 Sam Cunningham, a fishmonger from Somerset won the contest, after eating 74 ft of nettles. \n\nIn June 2014 Phillip Thorne, a chef from Colyton, Devon won the contest, after eating 80 ft of nettles.\nQuestion:\nThe Bottle Inn at Marshwood in Dorset has what annual eye watering and tongue numbing item on the menu?\nAnswer:\nLarge-leaved Nettle\nPassage:\nMidlands Grand National\n|}\n\n \n\nThe Midlands Grand National is a Listed National Hunt race in Great Britain. It is a handicap steeplechase and is run at Uttoxeter Racecourse in March, over a distance of 4 miles, 1 furlong and 110 yards.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first race was run on 3 May 1969.  The race was initially run over 4m2f and was increased up to 4m4f in 1977. During this period it would have been, assuming accurate measurements, by 24 yards or approximately the length of a cricket pitch, the longest race in the NH calendar. In 1991 the distance was dropped to 4m, before being upped to 4m2f in 1993. It has been run at its present distance of 4m1f110yds yards since 2004. \n\nThe 1977 winner Watafella finished third in the race but was promoted to first place after the first and second, No Scotch and Evander were disqualified after it was realised they failed to meet the conditions of the race, along with three other runners. \n\nThe race was not covered on television in its early years but was shown by Channel 4 during the 1980s and up until 1998. The BBC took over coverage between 1998 and 2005 before the race returned to Channel 4, who continue to cover until this day.\n\nRecords\n\nMost successful horse:\n* no horse has won the race more than once\n\nLeading jockey (2 wins):\n* Ken White - Happy Spring (1969), Rip\u2019s Lyric (1973)\n* Derek Morris - Midnight Madness (1987), Mister Ed (1993)\n* Brendan Powell - Another Excuse (1996), Young Kenny (1999)\n* Norman Williamson - Lucky Lane (1995), The Bunny Boiler (2002)\n\nLeading trainer (4 wins):\n\n* David Pipe - Minella Four Star (2011), Master Overseer (2012), Big Occasion (2013), Goulanes (2014)\n* Widest winning margin \u2013 Another Excuse (1996) \u2013 distance\n* Narrowest winning margin \u2013 Fighting Chance (1974), Knock Hill (1988) \u2013 head\n* Most runners \u2013 22, in 1978, 1979 and 1981\n* Fewest runners \u2013 6, in 2000\n\nWinners\n\n* Amateur jockeys indicated by \"Mr\".\n\n The 1983 running was cancelled due to a waterlogged track.\n The 2001 running was cancelled due to a foot-and-mouth crisis.\n The 2004 running was cancelled due to high winds.\nQuestion:\nWhich racecourse stages the Midlands Grand National?\nAnswer:\nWuttucesh\u01e3ddre\nPassage:\nMonologue\nIn theatre, a monologue (from Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 from \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 m\u00f3nos, \"alone, solitary\" and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 l\u00f3gos, \"speech\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films,  etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry.  Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.\n\nSimilar literary devices\n\nMonologues are similar to poems, epiphanies, and others in that they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.  Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.  Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a dialogue interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).\n\nHistory\n\nIn ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama, the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.  The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.\n\nAncient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.  One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.  Other monologue types included \"entrance monologues\" and exit monologues.  In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.\n\nFrom Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches. \u00d7\u2192\u2192\n\nTypes of monologues\n\nInterior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.  Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense. \n\nAudition monologues\n\nActors in theatre and sometimes in film and television may be called upon to use monologues for audition purposes. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.  These pieces are usually relegated to two minutes (sometimes less) and are often paired with a contrasting monologue. This can be a comic monologue paired with a dramatic monologue or it can mean classical paired with contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition can often depend on the play in question or the role the actor wants to land. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors and a tradition that continues today.\nQuestion:\nWhich word describes a monologue where an actor addresses an audience by speaking his thoughts aloud?\nAnswer:\nSoliloquy\nPassage:\nCliffs of Moher\nThe Cliffs of Moher ()  are located at the southwestern edge of the Burren region in County Clare, Ireland.   They rise 120 m above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag's Head and reach their maximum height of 214 m just north of O'Brien's Tower, eight kilometres to the north.  A round stone tower near the midpoint of the cliffs was built in 1835 by Sir Cornelius O'Brien.  From the cliffs and from atop the tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. The cliffs rank amongst the top-visited tourist sites in Ireland  and receive almost one million visitors a year. The closest settlements are Liscannor (6\u00a0km south) and Doolin (7\u00a0km north).\n\nName\n\nThe cliffs take their name from an old fort called Moher, which once stood on Hag's Head, the southernmost point of the cliffs. The writer Thomas Johnson Westropp referred to it in 1905 as Moher U\u00ed Ruis or Moher U\u00ed Ruidhin.  The fort still stood in 1780 and is mentioned in an account from John Lloyd's A Short Tour Of Clare (1780).  It was demolished in 1808 to provide material for a new telegraph tower. The present tower near the site of the old Moher U\u00ed Ruidhin was built as a lookout tower during the Napoleonic wars. \n\nTourism\n\nThe cliffs are one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland and topped the list of attractions in 2006 by drawing almost one million visitors.  Since 2011, they have formed a part of the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark, one of a family of geotourism destinations throughout Europe that are members of the European Geoparks Network. \n\nIn the 1990s, Clare County Council initiated development plans to enable visitors to experience the cliffs without significant intrusive man-made amenities. In keeping with this approach, the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience was built into a hillside approaching the cliffs. The centre is also intended to be environmentally sensitive in its use of renewable energy systems including geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels, and grey water recycling. \n\nThe \u20ac32 million facility was planned and built over a 17-year period and officially opened in February 2007. Facility exhibits include interactive media displays covering the geology, history, flora and fauna of the cliffs. A large multimedia screen displays a bird's-eye view from the cliffs, as well as video from the underwater caves below the cliffs. \n\nThe visitor's centre charges \u20ac6 per adult, with children under 16 admitted free. This covers parking, access to the visitor centre and Atlantic Edge exhibition, and a contribution towards conservation and safety at the cliffs. \n\nThe Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience won an award in the Interpret Britain & Ireland Awards 2007 awarded by the Association of Heritage Interpretation (AHI).  Although the award was specifically for the Atlantic Edge exhibition, the AHI assessed the entire visitor centre and site. The citation stated that the entire visitor centre was \"one of the best facilities that the judges had ever seen.\" \n\nSeparate ferry trips also allow tourists to view the cliffs from sea level. \n\nGeology and wildlife\n\nThe cliffs consist mainly of beds of Namurian shale and sandstone,  with the oldest rocks being found at the bottom of the cliffs. It is possible to see 300-million-year-old river channels cutting through, forming unconformities at the base of the cliffs.\n\nThere are an estimated 30,000 birds living on the cliffs, representing more than 20 species.  These include Atlantic puffins, which live in large colonies at isolated parts of the cliffs and on the small Goat Island, and razorbills.\nThe site is an Important Bird Area. \n\nPopular culture\n\nThe Cliffs of Moher have appeared in numerous media. In cinema, the cliffs have appeared in several films, including The Princess Bride (1987) (as the filming location for \"The Cliffs of Insanity\"), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009),  and Leap Year (2010).  The cliffs are mentioned in the Martin Scorsese film Bringing Out the Dead (1999) and are noted in the 2008 documentary Waveriders as the location of a large surfing wave known as \"Aileens\". \n\nIn music, the cliffs have appeared in music videos, including Maroon 5's \"Runaway\" video, Westlife's \"My Love\", and Rich Mullins' \"The Color Green\". Most of singer Dusty Springfield's ashes were scattered at the cliffs by her brother, Tom.  Gaelic Storm's song \"Green Eyes Red Hair\" references the cliffs. \n\nIn television, the cliffs appear in the episodes of Father Ted called \"Tentacles of Doom\" and \"Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading\" (1996).\n\nIn literature, the cliffs are an important location in Anthony Trollope's An Eye for an Eye, and in Eoin Colfer's The Wish List.\n\nTransport\n\nBus \u00c9ireann route 350 links the Cliffs of Moher to several locations: Ennis, Ennistymon, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna, Kinvara and Galway. This service includes a number of journeys each way daily. There is also a privately operated shuttle bus that serves the site from Doolin. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Pano 4184 -1024-Cliffs of Moher.jpg|A wide perspective\nFile:MoherView1.jpg|A 200-metre drop\nFile:Moher01(js).jpg|The cliffs from the sea\nFile:Moher11(js).jpg|Local feral Bilberry goats\nFile:Branaunmore-Moher-2012.JPG|Branaunmore sea stack\nFile:View of Cliffs of Moher.jpg|Looking south over the Cliffs of Moher\nFile:Cliffs_of_moher_33mp.jpg|Panorama from below O'Brien's Tower\nQuestion:\nIn which Irish county would you find the Cliffs of Moher?\nAnswer:\nClare\nPassage:\nClaret Jug\nThe Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug, is the trophy presented to the winner of The Open Championship, (often called the \"British Open\"), one of the four major championships in golf.\n\nThe awarding of the Claret Jug dates from 1872, when a new trophy was needed after Young Tom Morris had won the original Challenge Belt (presented by Prestwick Golf Club) outright in 1870 by winning the Championship three years in a row. Prestwick had both hosted and organised the Championship from 1860 to 1870.\n\nBy the time that Prestwick had reached agreement with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (based at Musselburgh) for the championship to rotate at these three venues, more than a year had passed. So, there was no event in 1871.\n\nEach club contributed \u00a310 to the cost of the new trophy, which is inscribed 'The Golf Champion Trophy', and was made by Mackay Cunningham & Company of Edinburgh.\n\nWhen the 1872 event was played, the trophy still wasn't ready in time to be presented to Morris (who had won his fourth in a row) although his name was the first to be engraved on it. In 1872, Morris was presented with a medal as have all subsequent winners.\n\nIn 1873 Tom Kidd became the first winner to be actually presented with the Claret Jug after winning the Championship.\n\nThe original Claret Jug has been on permanent display at the clubhouse of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews since 1928. The original Challenge Belt is also on display at the same site, having been donated in 1908 by the Morris family.\n\nThe current Claret Jug was first awarded to Walter Hagen for winning the 1928 Open. The winner must return the trophy before the next year's Open, and receives a replica to keep permanently. Three other replicas exist \u2014 one in the British Museum of Golf at St Andrews, and two used for travelling exhibitions.\n\nEvery year, the winner's name is engraved on the Claret Jug before it is presented to him. The BBC always shows the engraver poised to start work, and the commentators like to speculate about when he will be sure enough of the outcome to begin. However, at the 1999 Open Championship, Jean van de Velde's name was engraved on the trophy before he famously choked with a triple-bogey on the 18th hole and Paul Lawrie subsequently won the playoff. Upon being awarded the Jug in 1989, Mark Calcavecchia said, \"How's my name going to fit on that thing?\" \n\nThe Claret Jug has twice appeared on commemorative \u00a35 Scottish banknotes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland: first in 2004, for the 250th Anniversary of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, then in 2005, the jug is shown held by Jack Nicklaus to mark his retirement.\nQuestion:\nThe Claret Jug is awarded to the winner of which competition?\nAnswer:\nOpen Golf Championship\nPassage:\nBallinasloe\nBallinasloe ()  is a town in the easternmost part of County Galway in Ireland. It is regarded as the largest town in County Galway with a population of 7,674, which includes Ballinasloe Urban and Ballinasloe Rural.\n\nName and history\n\nThe town developed as a crossing point on the River Suck, a tributary of the Shannon. The Irish placename \u2013 meaning the mouth of the ford of the crowds \u2013 reflects this purpose. The latter part of the name suggests the town has been a meeting place since ancient times. The patron saint of Ballinasloe is Saint Grellan, whom tradition believes built the first church in the area at Kilcloony. A local housing estate, a GAA club, the branch of Conradh na Gaeilge, and formerly a school are named after him.\n\nSupermacs opened their first store there and there is now four stores open.\n\nOctober Fair and Festival\n\nEvery October, Ballinasloe is host to the ancient annual October Fair. Chiefly agricultural in the past, it is now focused on the horse. The Ballinasloe Fair is one of the oldest horse fairs in Europe; bathed in history it dates back to the 18th century. Today the ever popular fair is still held, along with a festival that attracts up to 100,000 visitors from all over the world. The town also boasts a successful summer festival called An tS\u00faca Fiain.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe biggest local employers are Portiuncula and St. Brigid's hospitals. The Dubarry shoe manufacturing company has been based in the town, although manufacturing at the plant ceased in November 2004.  The American pen manufacturing company A. T. Cross had a factory in the town for many years as did electrical components company Square D.\n\nBallinasloe like much of rural Ireland enjoyed a period of growth and expansion in the 2000s, thanks to the \"Celtic Tiger\" economic boom. However the town has suffered since the financial crash of 2008 and like many small towns in the region, it has seen a brain drain of the youth and educated.\n\nBusinesses and shops face competition from larger towns such as Athlone and Galway City.\n\nAs of 2015, employment in the town centres around its hotels, hospital and factories.\n\nNotable people\n\n*Denis Delaney, piper\n*John Feeley, classical guitarist\n*Patrick Green VC\n*Desmond Hogan, writer\n*Noel Mannion, , rugby player\n*Ray McLoughlin, rugby player\n*Se\u00e1n na Maighe \u00d3 Cellaigh, petty chief\n*John O'Connor Power, politician\n*Eoghan \u00d3 Tuairisc, poet and writer\n\nTransport\n\nBallinasloe railway station opened on 1 August 1851,  and is served by the Dublin\u2013Galway railway line. Once a notorious bottleneck on the old Galway to Dublin road, on 18 December 2009, the town was officially bypassed for the first time, when the M6 motorway opened as an upgrade to the N6.\nFrom 1828 to the 1960s, Ballinasloe was the terminus of the Grand Canal. Guinness Company used the town's canal stores to store and distribute the Guinness to the midlands. Grand Canal provided an easy route for Guinness barges to travel from Dublin to Shannon Harbour. A new public marina has been developed on the river in recent years that allows traffic from the Shannon navigation to access the town.\n\nLocal Media\n\nA number of newspapers circulate in the Ballinasloe area, such as Ballinasloe Life magazine, the Connacht Tribune, Galway Advertiser, Athlone Topic and the Roscommon Herald. As Ballinasloe sits on the border between two counties it is served by 2 local radio stations, Galway Bay FM and Shannonside FM. Local radio from other neighbouring counties such as Midlands 103 and Tipp FM are well received in the area. National stations in the area include RT\u00c9 Radio 1, 2FM, RT\u00c9 Lyric FM, Today FM, and 4FM.\n\nSport\n\nBallinasloe itself harbours historically rich soccer, golf, and rugby clubs, alongside Duggan Park Gaelic Athletic Association grounds. The local GAA clubs are Ballinasloe GAA (incorporating St Grellan's Gaelic football club and the Ballinasloe Hurling Club), Derrymullen Handball Club and Ballinasloe Camogie Club. Ballinasloe has a boxing tradition as well, and two resident boxing clubs.\n\nSchools\n\nIn Ballinasloe there are four national schools (Scoil U\u00ed Cheithearnaigh, Creagh National School,    [http://www.stteresas.ie St Teresa's Special School] and Scoil an Chro\u00ed Naofa) and two secondary schools (St Joseph's College, Garbally and Ard Scoil Mhuire).\n\nTwin towns\n\nChalonnes-sur-Loire, Maine-et-Loire, France.

Napa Valley is by far the most valuable appellation in the U.S. and that explains the fuss over the delimits of its borders.The official boundaries eventually included 16 sub-regions, some of which (Carneros, Chiles) lie outside the geographic valley itself. Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon fetches the highest prices of any American wine, so it\u2019s no surprise that the valley represents 25 percent of California\u2019s wine revenues. Any wine of any variety is easier to sell with \u201cNapa Valley\u201d on the label, but enhanced value comes with sub-regional names, such as: Diamond Mountain, Howell Mountain, Oakville, Mt Veeder, Rutherford, Spring Mountain, and Stags Leap.

Official  cheese is to be aged for between 60 days and two years.\n\n has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture, and often contains small, unevenly distributed air pockets. The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige. The cheese has a distinctive flavour, well-developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy, and leaves an aftertaste that is characteristic of sheep\u2019s milk.\n\nThe designation  is protected under Spain's Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen (DO) regulatory classification system,  and the cheese has been granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European Union. \n\nPDO requirements\n\nTo be designated as , the cheese must satisfy the following requirements: \n* It must have been produced in an area that is restricted to designated parts of the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca and Toledo that lie within the La Mancha region.\n* It can be made only with the whole milk of sheep of the  breed that are raised on registered farms within the designated area.\n* The cheese must have been aged for a minimum of 60 days (30 days for cheeses weighing up to 1.5\u00a0kg) and a maximum of two years.\n* The cheese must be produced by pressing in a cylindrical mould that has a maximum height of 12\u00a0cm and a maximum diameter of 22\u00a0cm.\n\n cheese can be made from pasteurised or raw milk; if the latter, it may be labelled as  (artisan). The only permitted additives are natural rennet or another approved coagulating enzyme, and sodium chloride (salt).\n\nManufacture and labeling\n\nThe moulds in which the cheese is pressed are barrel-shaped. Traditionally,  cheese was made by pressing the curd in plaited esparto grass baskets, which left a distinctive zig-zag pattern (known as ) on the rind.  Today the same effect is achieved by the mould, the inside of which has a design in relief that imparts to the finished cheese an embossed pattern similar to that of woven esparto grass. The top and bottom surfaces of the cheese are impressed with a design of an ear of wheat.\n\nDuring the maturation process, manchego cheese develops a natural rind. The regulations permit this to be washed, coated in paraffin, dipped in olive oil, or treated with certain approved transparent substances, but require that it must not be removed if the cheese is to be marketed as PDO.\n\nCheeses that meet the DO requirements carry a casein tab that is applied when the cheese is in the mould and bear a distinctive label that is issued by the Manchego Cheese Denomination of Origin Regulating Council; this carries the legend , a serial number, and artwork depicting Don Quixote de La Mancha. \n\nA cheese that is similar to  and made in the same region, but from a blend of cow's, goat's, and ewe's milk, is sold as  or  cheese.\n\nVarieties\n\n has variety of different flavours depending on its age. There are four versions of maturity sold: \n\n*  \u2013 the fresh cheese is aged for only 2 weeks, with a rich but mild flavour. Produced in small quantities, it is rarely found outside Spain.\n*   is a semi-firm cheese aged for three weeks to three months, somewhat milder than curado.\n*  is a semi-firm cheese aged for three to six months with a sweet and nutty flavor.\n* , aged for one year is firm with a sharper flavour the longer it is aged and a rich deep pepperiness to it. It grates well, but can also be eaten on its own or as tapas. \n\nAmerica\n\nNorth America\n\nIn Mexico and Spanish-speaking areas of the United States,  or  (manchego-type cheese) is the name given to a cow's milk cheese similar in taste to Monterey Jack. It melts well and is often used in quesadillas. Apart from the name, this cheese has little in common with the Spanish variety. \n\nCentral America\n\nIn Costa Rica, two companies (Dos Pinos and Los Alpes ) \nproduce a manchego-type cheese (queso tipo manchego) which can come with a drawing of Don Quijote on the labels. One company also makes a manchego-type cheese with basil added. These Costa-Rican cheeses can come dipped in paraffin, and some have the  pattern pressed on the side.\nQuestion:\nFrom which country does the cheese `Manchego' come?\nAnswer:\nIslands of Spain\nPassage:\nWelshpool\nWelshpool () is a town in Wales, historically in the county of Montgomeryshire, but currently administered as part of the unitary authority of Powys. The town is 4 mi from the Wales\u2013England border and low-lying on the River Severn; its Welsh language name Y Trallwng literally means \"the marshy or sinking land\". Welshpool is the fourth largest town in Powys.\n\nIn English it was initially known as Pool but its name was changed to Welshpool in 1835 to distinguish it from the English town of Poole.  It has a population of 6,664 (United Kingdom Census 2011), contains much Georgian architecture and is just north of Powis Castle.\n\nHistory\n\nSt Cynfelin (he is also known as St Matu) is reputed to be the founder of the church of St Mary's and St Cynfelin's in the town during \"the age of the saints in Wales\" in the 5th and 6th centuries.\n\nThe parish of Welshpool roughly coincides with the medieval commote of Ystrad Marchell in the cantref of Ystlyg in the Kingdom of Powys.\n\nThe Long Mountain, which plays as a backdrop to most of Welshpool, once served as the ultimate grounds for defence for fortresses in the times when the town was just a swampy marsh. Welshpool served briefly as the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn or South Powys after its prince was forced to flee the traditional Welsh royal site at Mathrafal in 1212. After 1284 Powys Wenwynwyn ceased to exist. \n\nThe town was devastated by the forces of Owain Glynd\u0175r in 1400 at the start of his rebellion against the English king Henry IV. Today the waymarked long-distance footpath and National Trail Glynd\u0175r's Way runs through the town.\n\nIn 1411 the priest at the church St Mary's and St Cynfelin's was Adam of Usk.\n\nHistoric buildings\n\nThe Mermaid Inn, 28 High Street, was very probably an early 16th century merchant\u2019s house, placed on a burgage plot between the High Street and Alfred Jones Court. The timber-ramed building has long storehouse or wing to the rear. The frontage was remodelled  1890, by Frank H. Shayler, architect, of Shrewsbury. Early illustrations of the building show that prior to this it had a thatched roof and that the timbering was not exposed. There is a passage to side with heavy box-framing in square panels, with brick infill exposed in side elevation and in rear wing. The frontage was exposed by Shayler to show decorative timber work on the upper storey. An Inn by the 19th century when it was owned by a family named Sparrow. \n  \n\nThere is an octagonal brick cockpit in New Street, which was built in the early 18th century and was in continual use for cockfighting until the practice was outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849.  , it is the home of the town's Women's Institute.\n\nTransport\n\nWelshpool railway station is on the Cambrian Line and is served by Arriva Trains Wales. The town is also the starting point of the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway, a narrow-gauge heritage railway popular with tourists, with its terminus station at Raven Square. The light railway once ran through the town to the Cambrian Line railway station, but today Raven Square, located on the western edge of the town, is the eastern terminus of the line.\n\nA small network of bus services link surrounding towns and villages, mainly operated by Tanat Valley Coaches. Notable is service No X75, serving Shrewsbury to the east and Newtown and Llanidloes to the south west, also service No D71 to Oswestry via Guilsfield and Llanymynech. In addition there is a local town service operated by Owen's Coaches. The semi-disused Montgomery Canal also runs through Welshpool. To the south of the town is Welshpool Airport which is also known as the Mid Wales Airport.  Three major trunk roads pass through Welshpool: the A458, A483 and the A490.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe local economy is primarily based upon agriculture and local industry. The Smithfield Livestock Market is the largest one-day sheep market in Europe, whilst the town's industrial estates are home to numerous different types of small industry.\nDue to the town's small size and population the attraction of high street stores is limited, meaning many of the residents are forced to shop in neighbouring towns like Newtown and Shrewsbury.\n\nEducation\n\nThe town is the home of Ardwyn Nursery and Infants School, Oldford Nursery and Infants School, Gungrog Nursery and Infants School, Maes-y-dre Primary School and Welshpool High School is a secondary school which teaches a range of pupils from ages 11\u201318 and is consistently set to a very high standard of education throughout Key Stage 3 and 4 and A Level studies.\n\nSport\n\nWelshpool has a football club and a rugby union club, the former being Welshpool Town F.C. and the latter, Welshpool Rugby Football Club. The town also has hockey and cricket clubs. The Montgomeryshire Marauders Rugby League Club are also nominally based in Welshpool, as this is where the majority of their home fixtures take place.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nOn which river is the market town of Welshpool?\nAnswer:\nSeven Boar\nPassage:\nSt. Gallen\u2013Altenrhein Airport\nSt. Gallen\u2013Altenrhein Airport  is a small airport in Altenrhein in the Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland near Lake Constance. It is also known under its trading name People's Business Airport  and is the home base for People's Viennaline.\n\nHistory\n\nAt the end of World War II, Swiss authorities identified existing locations that were to be modernized as regional airports, a second tier of infrastructure to support the primary urban airports, with St. Gallen-Altenrhein being one of the five. \n\nAustrian Airlines served St. Gallen-Altenrhein from Vienna since 2003 when it took over the route from Rheintalflug, a predecessor of InterSky. The airport decided to terminate the contracts with Austrian in 2011 and started their own airline, People's Viennaline, to serve the route. Austrian decided to continue the route as well in direct competition. As a result, there were up to six daily flights from the small airport to Vienna during that period. In spring 2013, Austrian announced the termination of their route to Vienna due to continuing losses as a result of the harsh competition.  After that, People's offered a codeshare agreement to Austrian, which they declined. \n\nFacilities\n\nTerminal\n\nThe airport features a small passenger terminal building and some apron and hangar stands for aircraft such as the Embraer 170, business jets or general aviation planes such as the Cessna 172. As there are no jet bridges, walk-boarding is used.\n\nRunway\n\nThe paved, eastbound runway 10 is equipped with an Instrument landing system (ILS CAT I).  Due to its short length the main runway can only be used by smaller passenger aircraft such as the Embraer E-Jets or the Bombardier Q Series.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nThe following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at St. Gallen\u2013Altenrhein Airport: \n\nThe nearest bigger airport is Friedrichshafen Airport in Germany, on the opposite side of Lake Constance 45 km to the northwest by ferry.\n\nGround transportation\n\nThe airport can be reached via motorway A1 (Z\u00fcrich - Winterthur, Exit Rheineck-Thal). Taxis and a shuttle service are available. There is also a scheduled bus connection from the airport to the nearby towns of Rorschach and Rheineck and their railway stations.\nQuestion:\nSt Gallen Airport is in which European country?\nAnswer:\nISO 3166-1:CH\nPassage:\nRingo Kid\nThe Ringo Kid  is a fictional Western hero in the Marvel Comics' universe, whose comic book series was originally released by the company's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics. A lesser-known character than the company's Kid Colt, Rawhide Kid, or Two-Gun Kid, he also appeared in a reprint series in the 1970s.\n\nThe character is unrelated to the actor John Wayne's \"Ringo Kid\" in the Western film Stagecoach.\n\nPublication history\n\nAtlas Comics' Ringo Kid debuted in the first issue of a series billed on its trademarked cover logo as Ringo Kid for all but two issues (#1 and #3, cover-billed as Ringo Kid Western).  Created by an unknown writer and artist Joe Maneely, it ran 21 issues (cover-dated Aug. 1954 - Sept. 1957), drawn primarily by either Maneely or Fred Kida. Stories also ran occasionally in Wild Western, beginning with issue #38 (Nov. 1954), initially drawn by Maneely, with artist John Severin taking the reins in at least issues #46-47 (Nov. 1955 - Jan. 1956). Ringo was the lead feature in the two-issue anthology series Western Trails #1-2 (May & July 1957).   He also appears on the cover of Wild Western #39 (Dec. 1954), but not in an interior story.  \n\nA five-page story entitled \"The Ringo Kid\" in Atlas' Western Outlaws & Sheriffs #73 (June 1952) is unrelated,  as is the four-page story \"Ringo Kid\" in Wild Western #26 (Feb. 1953). \n\nMarvel reprinted the series in Ringo Kid vol. 2, #1-30 (Jan. 1970 - Nov. 1976), often with the original Maneely covers. The Ringo Kid made his first appearance in present-day stories in a time travel tale in the superhero-team comic The Avengers #142 (Dec. 1975)\n\nMarvel writer Steve Englehart planned a revival series at about this time, with art by Dick Ayers: \"Every series I did took off so Marvel kept giving me more. I relaunched this classic Western \u2014 always my favorite of Marvel's true cowboy heroes (as opposed to the Two-Gun Kid, whom I also liked but who was more a superhero) \u2014 with classic Western artist Dick Ayres [sic]. But after this first issue was drawn and scripted, Marvel decided to do more superheroes and fewer cowboys, so it was set aside before inking\". \n\nFictional character biography\n\nThe Ringo Kid, dressed all in black, is a heroic gunslinger of the 19th-century American Old West with a Caucasian father, Cory Rand, and a Native American mother, Dawn Star, variously referred to as a Comanche or a Cheyenne \"princess of her tribe despite the fact that the very idea of princesses was alien to that culture, imagined by settlers of European extraction, projecting their notions of royalty onto the natives.\" He was treated as an outcast because of his mixed heritage, and on the run after being falsely accused of a crime. With his sidekick Dull Knife, of his mother's people, he roamed the frontier atop his horse, Arab. His specific mission or goal appears not to have been stated explicitly, but there is intimation of some law-enforcement function: As many covers note breathlessly, \"Ringo!\" is \"The name that makes killers tremble!\"\nQuestion:\nWho played the Ringo Kid in the 1938 film 'Stagecoach'?\nAnswer:\nMichael Morris (John Wayne)\n", "answers": ["Fedallah", "Timor Tim", "Dagoo", "Moby-Dick: Captain Ahab", "Moby Dick; or, The Whale", "Ahab's Wife, Or, The Star-Gazer", "Moby-dick", "Moby Dick: Captain Ahab", "Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish", "Tashtego", "Call me Ishmael", "Moby-Dick (character)", "Moby-Dick", "Moby-Dick; or, The White Whale", "Starbuck: Moby Dick", "Moby dick", "Moby-Dick; or, The Whale", "Moby Dick (Novel)", "Starbuck (Moby-Dick)", "Ahabian", "Moby Dick", "MobyDick", "Moby-Dick (novel)"], "pred": "Question:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:Answer:", "length": 8720, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6ebc860d3b3488f1b4fdf04ed5bd953a699da063f62b32e1"}
{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nScottish Blackface\nThe Scottish Blackface is the most common breed of domestic sheep in the United Kingdom. This tough and adaptable breed is often found in the more exposed locations, such as the Scottish Highlands or roaming on the moors of Dartmoor. It is also known as Blackfaced Highland, Kerry, Linton, Scottish Mountain, Scottish Highland, Scotch Blackface and Scotch Horn. \n \nBlackfaces are horned in both sexes, and as their name suggests, they usually have a black face (but sometimes with white markings), and black legs.   This breed is primarily raised for meat. \n\nHistory\n\nThe origins of the breed are uncertain. It was developed on the Anglo-Scottish border but it is not clear exactly when it became a distinct breed. It replaced the earlier Scottish Dunface or Old Scottish Short-wool, a Northern European short-tailed sheep type probably similar to the modern Shetland. \n\nRecords show that in 1503 James IV of Scotland established a flock of 5,000 Scottish Blackface Sheep in Ettrick Forest in the area south of Peebles in the Borders.\n\nToday the Blackface is the most numerous breed in the British Isles.  Roughly thirty percent of all sheep in the UK are Scottish Blackface. The Blackface epitomises the mountain sheep. They have long coarse wool that shields them from moisture and biting winds. They are able to survive the harshest winters in the most extreme parts of Great Britain. \n\nSeveral types of Scottish Blackface have developed over the years, but the most common are the Perth variety, which is large framed, with a longer coat, and mainly found in north-east Scotland, Devon, Cornwall and Northern Ireland, and the medium-framed Lanark type, with shorter wool, commonly found in Scotland and Ireland. \n\nThe introduction of Black Faced Highland sheep to America  first occurred in June, 1861, Hugh Brodie imported one ram and two ewes for Brodie & Campbell, New York Mills, New York. In 1867 this flock and  increase was purchased by T. L. Harison of Morley, St. Lawrence County, New York. Isaac Stickney of New York also imported a small flock about 1867 for his farm in Illinois.\n\nBlackface ewes are excellent mothers and will often attempt to defend their lambs against predators.  They are good milkers and are able to yield a lamb crop and a wool clip even when on marginal pastures. The breed spread from the border areas during the 19th century to the highlands and the Scottish islands. They also crossed to Northern Ireland and the US. There are flocks scattered across the USA but this robust little breed has remained a minor breed in North America. Blackface lambs yield a carcass ideal for the modern consumer. The meat is free of superfluous fat and waste and is known the world over for its distinct flavour. Although they are not large sheep they have enormous potential for the production of high quality lean lamb for today's health conscious consumer. There has never been a case of natural occurring Scrapie in a Scottish Blackface Sheep. In a controlled study in the UK goats and Blackface where infected by researchers but there is not one documented case of naturally spread scrapie in a Blackface raised in the USA or the UK. Scrapie, an invariably fatal disease of sheep and goats, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The putative infectious agent is the host-encoded prion protein, PrP.\n\nScottish Blackface wool\n\nScottish Blackface wool is a speciality wool in a class of its own. There are variations in type of fleece according to the way the sheep were bred. In general, there are a southwest type (short wool) and a central Scotland type (long wool). The southwest type is the finer, with a Bradford count of forty or so, generally classed as short or medium: ewe's fleece of 3 to 4\u00bd\u00a0lb, greasy. The central type is a stronger wool classed as long or deep strong; this type gives a ewe fleece of 5 to 6\u00bd\u00a0lb, greasy. The main markets are the mattress and upholstery trade, carpet and heavy cloth trade. Strong Blackface wool undoubtedly makes the best mattress filling there is: the demand for this is very good. The carpet trade all over the world (even New Zealand and Australia) uses large quantities of the medium class of Scottish Blackface wool.\nThe finer wools are used for blending into many of the strong wearing clothes, over-coating,working tweeds and heavy blankets, The finest Scottish Blackface wool goes to the famous Harris tweed trade.\n \nThe [http://www.sheepusa.org American Sheep Industry Association] reports an average fibre diameter of 38 to 28 micrometres (or microns), and staple length of 10 to. \n\nArtisans have long treasured the horns of the Blackface for the carving of shepherd's crooks and walking sticks. In the US the fleeces are becoming of interest to fibre artists and hand spinners for use in tapestry and the making of rugs and saddle blankets.\nQuestion:\nScottish Blackface is a breed of which animal?\nAnswer:\nSheep\nPassage:\nStompie Moeketsi\nJames Seipei (1974\u20131989), also known as Stompie Moeketsi, was a teenage United Democratic Front (UDF) activist from Parys in South Africa. He and three other boys were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 by members of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United football club. Moeketsi was murdered on 1 January 1989, the only one of the boys to be killed. \n\nActivism\n\nMoeketsi joined the street uprising against apartheid in the mid-1980s at age ten, and soon took on a leading role. He became the country's youngest political detainee when he spent his 12th birthday in jail without trial.  At the age of 13 he was expelled from school.\n\nMurder\n\nMoeketsi, together with Kenny Kgase, Pelo Mekgwe and Thabiso Mono, were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 from the Methodist manse in Orlando, Soweto. Moeketsi was accused of being a police informer and after the 4 boys were kidnapped they were pleading and saying that Stompie isn't a police informer. Jerry Richardson, one of the members of Winnie Mandela's Football Club, was carrying a samurai-like sword before he closed the door and screams were heard as Stompie Moeketsi was murdered at the age of 14. His body was found on waste ground near Winnie Mandela's house on 6 January 1989, and recovered by the police. His throat had been cut. Jerry Richardson, one of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was convicted of the murder. He claimed that she had ordered him, with others, to abduct the four youths from Soweto, of whom Moeketsi was the youngest. The four were severely beaten.\n\nInvolvement of Winnie Mandela\n\nIn 1991, Winnie Mandela was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault,  but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine and a two-year suspended sentence on appeal. In 1992 she was accused of ordering the murder of Dr. Abu-Baker Asvat, a family friend who had examined Seipei at Mandela's house, after Seipei had been abducted but before he had been killed.  Mandela's role was later probed as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, in 1997.  She was said to have paid the equivalent of $8,000 and supplied the firearm used in the killing, which took place on 27 January 1989.  The hearings were later adjourned amid claims that witnesses were being intimidated on Winnie Mandela's orders. \n\nThis incident became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the apartheid government and opponents of the ANC, and Winnie Mandela's iconic status was dealt a heavy blow.\n\nAppearing before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997, she said allegations that she was involved in at least 18 human rights abuses including eight murders were \"ridiculous\" and claimed that her main accuser, former comrade Katiza Cebekhulu, was a former \"mental patient\" and his allegations against her were \"hallucinations\".  The Commission found that the abduction had been carried out on Winnie Mandela's instructions, and that she had \"initiated and participated in the assaults\". However, with regard to the actual murder the Commission found Mandela only \"negligent\".\nQuestion:\nWhich famous name was accused f the abduction of Stompie Seipei?\nAnswer:\nNomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela\nPassage:\nMens sana in corpore sano\nMens sana in corpore sano is a Latin phrase, usually translated as \"a sound mind in a sound body\" or \"a healthy mind in a healthy body\".\n\nIn the western world, the phrase is widely used in sporting and educational contexts to express the theory that physical exercise is an important or essential part of mental and psychological well-being.\n\nHistory\n\nThe phrase comes from Satire X of the Roman poet Juvenal (10.356).  It is the first in a list of what is desirable in life:\n\nTraditional commentators believe that Juvenal's intention was to teach his fellow Roman citizens that in the main, their prayers for such things as long life are misguided. That the gods had provided man with virtues which he then lists for them.\n\nOver time and separated from its context, the phrase has come to have a range of meanings.  It can be construed to mean that only a healthy mind can lead to a healthy body, or equally that only a healthy body can produce or sustain a healthy mind.  Its most general usage is to express the hierarchy of needs: with physical and mental health at the root.\n\nAn earlier, similar saying is attributed to the pre-Socratic philosopher Thales:\n\n\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd, \"\u1f41 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f51\u03b3\u03b9\u03ae\u03c2, \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u03b5\u1f54\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\"\nWhat man is happy? \"He who has a healthy body, a resourceful mind and a docile nature.\" \n\nUsages\n\n* Usage in other writings\n** John Locke (1632\u20131704) uses the phrase in his book Some Thoughts Concerning Education.\n** Heinrich von Treitschke used this phrase in his work titled The Army.

Sometimes they wear a pointed cap or hat and may be smoking a pipe.\nLeprechaun lore\nIn their book \"The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures,\" John and Caitlin Matthews trace leprechaun legends back to eighth-century legends of water spirits called \"luchorp\u00e1n,\" meaning small body. These sprites eventually merged with a mischievous household fairy said to haunt cellars and drink heavily.\nOther researchers say that the word leprechaun may be derived from the Irish leath bhrogan, meaning shoemaker. Indeed, though leprechauns are often associated with riches and gold, in folklore their main vocation is anything but glamorous: they are humble cobblers, or shoemakers. Shoemaking is apparently a lucrative business in the fairy world, since each leprechaun is said to have his own pot of gold, which can often be found at the end of a rainbow.\nAccording to Irish legends, people lucky enough to find a leprechaun and capture him (or, in some stories, steal his magical ring, coin or amulet) can barter his freedom for his treasure. Leprechauns are usually said to be able to grant the person three wishes. But dealing with leprechauns can be a tricky proposition.\nA trickster\nThe leprechaun plays several roles in Irish folklore; he is principally a roguish trickster figure who cannot be trusted and will deceive whenever possible. In her encyclopedia \"Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns, and Goblins,\" folklorist Carol Rose offers a typical tale of leprechaun trickery \"concerning a man who managed to get a leprechaun to show him the bush in the field where his treasure was located. Having no spade [shovel], the man marked the tree with one of his red garters, then kindly released the sprite and went for a spade. Returning almost instantly he found that every one of the numerous trees in the field sported a red garter!\"\nIn the magical world, most spirits, fairies and other creatures have a distinctive sound that is associated with them. Some entities \u2014 such as the Irish fairy banshee and the Hispanic spirit La Llorona \u2014 are said to emit a mournful wail signifying their presence. In the case of the leprechaun, it's the tap-tap-tapping of his tiny cobbler hammer, driving nails into shoes, that announces they are near.\nIn his collection of Irish fairy and folk tales, W.B. Yeats offered an 18th-century poem by William Allingham titled \"The Lepracaun; Or, Fairy Shoemaker\" which describes the sound:\n\"Lay your ear close to the hill.\nDo you not catch the tiny clamour,\nBusy click of an elfin hammer,\nVoice of the Lepracaun singing shrill\nAs he merrily plies his trade?\"\nThe 1825 publication of a book called \"Fairy Legends\" seemingly cemented the character of the modern leprechaun: \"Since that time leprechauns seem to be entirely male and solitary,\" they note.\nIt seems that all leprechauns are not only shoemakers but also old male loners, which makes sense from a cultural standpoint, since that type of fairy is so closely associated with shoemaking, a traditionally male vocation. Though there is something curious about all leprechauns being cobblers (what if they want to be writers, farmers, or doctors?), this designation also fits in well with the traditional folkloric division of labor among fairies.\nLeprechauns in popular culture\nAs with many old legends and traditions, the image and nature of the leprechaun has changed over time and has been updated (and in some cases sanitized) for a modern audience. Lucky the Leprechaun, mascot of the General Mills breakfast cereal Lucky Charms, is probably the best-known fairy of his type.\nOn the other end of the spectrum there's the homicidal leprechaun Lubdan in the \"Leprechaun\" horror/comedy film series (played by \"Willow\" actor Warwick Davis). For generations, some Irish have been annoyed by leprechauns and the ethnic stereotypes they perpetuate, and for most Americans leprechauns only appear around St. Patrick's Day .\nLeprechauns offer a morality tale figure whose fables warn against the folly of trying to get rich quick, take what's not rightfully yours or interfere with \"The Good Folk\" and other magical creatures. Belief in leprechauns and other fairies was once widespread on the Emerald Isle , and real or not they will continue to amuse and delight us for centuries more.\nBenjamin Radford is deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine and author of six books including \"Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore.\" His Web site is www.BenjaminRadford.com.\nAuthor Bio\nBenjamin Radford, Live Science Contributor\nBenjamin Radford is the Bad Science columnist for Live Science.

In 2011, the Observatory was named one of \"The World's 100 Most Important Places\" by TIME. It was at the Lowell Observatory that the dwarf planet Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh.\n\nThe Observatory's original 24 in Alvan Clark & Sons Telescope is still in use today for public education. Lowell Observatory hosts 85,000 visitors per year at their Steele Visitors Center, who take guided daytime tours and view various wonders of the night sky through the Clark Telescope and other telescopes. It was founded by astronomer Percival Lowell of Boston's well-known Lowell family and is overseen by a sole trustee, a position historically handed down through the family. The first trustee was Lowell's third cousin Guy Lowell (1916\u20131927). Percival's nephew Roger Putnam served from 1927\u20131967, followed by Roger's son Michael (1967\u20131987), Michael's brother William Lowell Putnam III (1987\u20132013), and current trustee W. Lowell Putnam.\n\nThe observatory operates several telescopes at three locations in the Flagstaff area. The main facility, located on Mars Hill just west of downtown Flagstaff, houses the original 24 in Clark Refracting Telescope, although its role today is as a public education tool and not research. The telescope, built in 1896 for $20,000, was assembled in Boston by Alvan Clark & Sons and then shipped by train to Flagstaff. Also located on the Mars Hill campus is the 13 in Pluto Discovery Telescope, used by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 to discover the dwarf planet Pluto.\n\nLowell Observatory currently operates four research telescopes at its Anderson Mesa dark sky site, located 20 km southeast of Flagstaff, including the 72 in Perkins Telescope (in partnership with Boston University) and the 42 in John S. Hall Telescope. Lowell is a partner with the United States Naval Observatory and Naval Research Laboratory in the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) also located at that site. The Observatory also operates smaller research telescopes at its historic site on Mars Hill and in Australia and Chile.\n\nPast Anderson Mesa, on the peak of Happy Jack, Lowell Observatory has also built and is commissioning the  Discovery Channel Telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, Inc.\n\nHistory (see discoveries below)\n\nAside from the wide array of research and discoveries listed below, one science program carried out at the Observatory was the measurement of the variability of solar irradiance.  When Harold L. Johnson took over as the director in 1952, the stated objective became to focus on light from the Sun reflecting from Uranus and Neptune. In 1953, the current 21 in telescope was erected. Beginning in 1954, this telescope began monitoring the brightness of these two planets, and comparing these measurements with a reference set of sunlike stars.\n\nFile:Percival_Lowell_observing_Venus_from_the_Lowell_Observatory_in_1914.jpg|Percival Lowell in the observer's chair of the Alvan Clark 24 in refractor \nFile:Lowell Observatory - Clark telescope.jpg|Alvan Clark refractor telescope, the first permanent telescope at Lowell Observatory\nFile:Lowell astrograph.jpg|13 in astrograph used to discover Pluto\n\nDiscovery Channel Telescope (DCT)  \n\nLowell Observatory is building a major new reflecting telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, located near Happy Jack, Arizona. This Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT), located within the Mogollon Rim Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest, is expected to be the fifth-largest telescope in the contiguous United States, and it will enable the astronomers of Lowell Observatory to enter new research areas deeper into outer space.\n\nThe DCT and the research carried out there will be the focus of ongoing informative and educational television programs about astronomy, the sciences, and technology to be telecast on the Discovery channels. The primary mirror of the Discovery Channel Telescope will be  in diameter. It will be supposely notable for its uncommon meniscus design for such a large mirror. This mirror was ground and polished into its parabolic shape at the Optical Fabrication and Engineering Facility of the College of Optical Sciences of the University of Arizona (in Tucson, Arizona).\n\nCurrent research \n\nLowell Observatory's astronomers conduct research on a wide range of solar system and astrophysical topics using ground-based, airborne, and space-based telescopes. Among the many current programs are a search for near-Earth asteroids, a survey of the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, a search for extrasolar planets, a decades-long study of the brightness stability of the sun, and a variety of investigations of star formation and other processes in distant galaxies. In addition, the Observatory staff designs and builds custom instrumentation for use on Lowell's telescopes and elsewhere. For example, Lowell staff built a sophisticated high-speed camera for use on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). SOFIA is a joint project of the United States and German space agencies and consists of a  telescope on board a Boeing 747 SP.\n\nNotable discoveries \n\n*The dwarf planet Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930\n*Large recessional velocities of galaxies by Vesto Melvin Slipher between 1912 and 1914 (that led ultimately to the realization our universe is expanding)\n*Co-discovery of the rings of Uranus in 1977\n*The periodic variation in the activity of Comet Halley during the 1985/1986 apparition \n*The three largest known stars\n*The atmosphere of Pluto\n*Accurate orbits for two of Pluto's moons: Nix and Hydra\n*Oxygen on Jupiter's satellite Ganymede\n*Carbon dioxide ice on three Uranian satellites\n*The first Trojan of Neptune\n*Evidence that the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contains water vapor\nQuestion:\nWhat was first seen at Lowell Observatory in 1930?\nAnswer:\n134340 Pluto.\nPassage:\nTiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn\nTiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn (literally, \"Sch\u00f6nbrunn Zoo\"), or \"Vienna Zoo\", is a zoo located on the grounds of the famous Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria. Founded as an imperial menagerie in 1752, it is the oldest zoo in the world.\nToday, Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn is considered and regards itself as a scientifically administered zoo which sees its main purpose as a centre for species conservation and general nature conservation as well as in the fulfillment of the education mandate given to it by the legislation. The still preserved buildings of the baroque era, which have been complemented in the last years by elements of modern zoo architecture, still convey a good impression of the 18th century menagerie-buildings after the Versailles model.\n\nDescription\n\nTiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn is one of the few zoos worldwide to house giant pandas.  The zoo's pandas are named Yang Yang (F), Long Hui (M), Fu Long (M), and Fu Hu (M).   Fu Long's birth on 23 August 2007 was the first natural insemination panda birth in Europe.   Fu Hu was born exactly 3 years later, and he was also conceived by natural mating.  One more panda cub, Fu Bao (\u798f\u8c79), was born nearly three years later on 14 August 2013 via natural mating. \n\nOther zoo attractions include a rainforest house, in which the spectator is led through a simulation of the Amazon rainforest, an aquarium, which enables  spectators to walk through underneath a simulation of the Amazon in flood, and, more recently, an exhibit of animals in unnatural habitats.  The new polarium for animals of the Arctic region was opened in early 2004.\n\nOn 14 July 1906, the zoo saw the birth of the first elephant in captivity. \n\nFrom its privatization in 1992, it has been led by Helmut Pechlaner, also president of WWF Austria, who managed to modernize most parts of the zoo and sustain its financial situation. Nowadays, as of 2014, the zoo is managed by Dagmar Schratter.\n\nPrivate and corporate sponsorship for the various animals is one of the methods employed by the zoo today, along with bookable night excursions and special children's programs. Zoological research takes place at the zoo.\n\nHistory\n\nThe zoo was constructed in 1752 next to Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn by Adrian van Stekhoven at the order of the then Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I, husband of Maria Theresia, to serve as an imperial menagerie. It was centered around a pavilion meant for imperial breakfasts. Therefore, thirteen animal enclosures in the form of cut cake pieces were established around this central pavilion.\n\nThe central pavilions and the menagerie building were built by Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey. A small zoo had already existed on the premises since 1540, but the complex was opened to the public only in 1779. Initially, there were no entrance fees.\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Joseph II organized expeditions to Africa and the Americas to procure specimens for the zoo. The arrival of the first giraffe in 1828 influenced Viennese fashion and city life. Clothes', accessories', and other items' designs were influenced, and Adolf B\u00e4uerle performed his play titled Giraffes in Vienna ().\n\nAt the onset of World War I, the zoo was home to 712 species and 3,500 specimens. Due to diminishing food supplies during the war, the number of specimens rapidly sank to 900. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the war, the zoo became the responsibility of the Austrian Republic.\n\nBombing raids on February 19 and February 21, 1945, during World War II, had an even greater impact on the zoo. Many buildings were destroyed and specimens killed, reducing the stock of specimens to 400. The new zoo director, Dr. Julius Brachetka, eventually managed to restore the zoo.\n\nThe zoo experienced a financial crisis in the 1980s, but closure of the zoo was prevented by privatization in 1992. Dr. Helmut Pechlaner was assigned as manager of the zoo. After his retirement on 1 January 2007, his deputy, Dr. Dagmar Schratter, took over his post.\n\nPechlaner was able to renovate and extend many of the enclosures thanks to a number of sponsors and significantly increased entrance fees. During his time as manager, the zoo was extended by a number of new buildings, including the rainforest house, the desert house, and the \"Tyrolean farmhouse\". A number of rare and exotic specimens, such as giant pandas and koalas, were attracted to the zoo and contributed to its upswing in popularity.\n\nIn the media\n\nA number of tragic accidents have plagued the zoo. In 2002, a jaguar attacked a caretaker during feeding, killing her in front of zoo visitors. The director tried to help and sustained heavy arm injuries. In February 2005, a young elephant, Abu, lethally crushed his caretaker. In the following press storm, director Pechlaner offered to resign over the issue. \n\nThe zoo is a filming location for the ORF series, Tom Turbo, which is based on a series of children's books by Thomas Brezina. Tom Turbo has its garage at the zoo since 2006, and is, together with its creator, sponsor of a tiger at the zoo. Former zoo director Pechlaner makes cameo appearances in a number of episodes.\n\nThe 250 Years Vienna Zoo Silver Coin\n\nThe zoo is so popular and famous that on its 250th anniversary, it was the topic of one of the most famous silver collectors' coins: the 5 euro 250 Years of Vienna Zoo commemorative coin minted on 8 May 2002.\n\nThe reverse shows the Emperor's Pavilion surrounded by a variety of animals from the zoo. The dates 1752-2002 refer to the anniversary and, of course, date the coin itself.\n\nLiterature \n\n* Ash, Mitchell and Dittrich, Lothar (ed.), Menagerie des Kaisers \u2013 Zoo der Wiener, Pichler Verlag, Vienna, 2002.

In South China Cinnamomum loureiroi and Mandarin orange peel is commonly used as a substitute for Cinnamomum cassia and cloves, respectively, producing a different flavour for southern five-spice powders.\n\nUse\n\nFive spice may be used with fatty meats such as pork, duck or goose. It is used as a spice rub for chicken, duck, pork and seafood, in red cooking recipes, or added to the breading for fried foods. Five spice is used in recipes for Cantonese roasted duck, as well as beef stew. It is used as a marinade for Vietnamese broiled chicken. The five-spice powder mixture has followed the Chinese diaspora and has been incorporated into other national cuisines throughout Asia.\n\nAlthough this mixture is used in restaurant cooking, many Chinese households do not use it in day-to-day cooking.  In Hawaii, some restaurants place a shaker of the spice on each patron's table. A seasoned salt can be easily made by dry-roasting common salt with five-spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.\nQuestion:\nFive spice powder is commonly used in which ethnic cuisine?\nAnswer:\nChine\u017fe\nPassage:\nSinger - Cars By Brand, Manufacturer Marques & Models ...\nSinger - Cars By Brand, Manufacturer Marques & Models | Classic Cars For Sale Magazine\nSinger\nThe first Singer cars - built under licence from Lea-Francis and designed by Alex Craig - were produced in 1905 by George Singer, who had worked for Coventry Machinists before producing cycle, tricycles and then cars.\nSinger died a year after the company went into receivership (in 1908) and the firm was re-established as Singer and Co.

Introduced in late 1964, the upmarket newcomer was powered by the same rev-happy engine as used in the less expensive Hillman. For 1966, the excellent Singer Chamois Sport arrived using the same peppy Imp Sport spec, while there was even a coupe based upon the Sunbeam Stiletto. For 1969, the Chamois featured quadruple headlamps but range was killed off just a year later.\nSinger Gazelle (To 1967)\nQuestion:\nWhich car company made the Chamois and Gazelle models?\nAnswer:\nLead (music)\nPassage:\nSaussurea\nSaussurea is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the thistle tribe within the daisy family, native to cool temperate and arctic regions of Asia, Europe, and North America, with the highest diversity in alpine habitats in the Himalaya and central Asia. Common names include saw-wort and snow lotus, the latter used for a number of high altitude species in central Asia.\n\nThey are perennial herbaceous plants, ranging in height from dwarf alpine species 5\u201310\u00a0cm tall, to tall thistle-like plants up to 3 m tall. The leaves are produced in a dense basal rosette, and then spirally up the flowering stem. The flowers form in a dense head of small capitula, often surrounded by dense white to purple woolly hairs; the individual florets are also white to purple. The wool is densest in the high altitude species, and aid in thermoregulation of the flowers, minimising frost damage at night, and also preventing ultraviolet light damage from the intense high altitude sunlight.\n\nDe Candolle named the genus after Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure (1740-1799) and Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure (1767\u20131845). \n\nUses\n\nA number of the high alpine Himalayan species are grown as ornamental plants for their decorative dense woolly flowerheads; they are among the most challenging plants to grow, being adapted to harsh climates from 3500\u20135000 m altitude, demanding cool temperatures, a very long (up to 8\u201310 months) winter rest period, and very good soil drainage in humus-rich gravel soils.\n\nTraditional uses \n\nCosti amari radix or costus root was an important item of Roman trade with India, and is believed to have been the dried root of Saussurea lappa. \n\nSeveral varieties of snow lotus are used in traditional Tibetan medicine. Saussurea lappa is used a component of the traditional Tibetan medicine Padma 28.  Research conducted on the Himalayan medicinal plants by C.P. Kala reveals that the practitioners of Tibetan medicine living in the Pin Valley of Himachal Pradesh use its root for curing dysentery and ulcer.  Saussurea involucrata flowers and stems have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cough with cold, stomachache, dysmenorrhea, and altitude sickness, and has been found to have antiinflammatory, cardiotonic, abortifacient, anticancer, and antifatigue actions. \n\nSaussurea obvallata, known as \"brahmakamala\" in India is one of the most sacred species, and it has been used for offerings to goddess Nanda Devi for time immemorial.  \n\nPharmacology\n\nSaussurea lappa and has been shown to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS by lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages, thus reducing nitric oxide production.  In rats, high doses of 50-200 milligrams per kilogram of crude ethanolic extract reduced observed inflammation in standard laboratory tests, and 25-100 milligrams per kilogram of the sesquiterpene fraction of the extract reduced several molecular markers of inflammation.    Ethanol extracts were shown to have analgesic and antiinflammatory effects at high doses of 75-300 milligrams per kilogram.  As the slow-growing wild plant is endangered by collections, a substitute grown in tissue culture has been suggested, which is mostly equivalent.  Generally the analgesic and antiinflammatory effects of the plant are much inferior to those of 10 milligrams of indomethacin.\n\nLiterature and culture\n\nIn most Chinese martial arts literature, the snow Lotus was classified a rare herb as precious as lingzhi mushroom, and old ginseng.\n\nSelected species\n\n*Saussurea abnormis.

The development of most significant for economics Japanese ports is financed 2/3 by government means; the remaining part is financed by port-managing organizations. Ministry of land infrastructure and transport in Japan can provide with stock capital for the securities that are issued by port-managing organizations if the project that is being carried into effect is important on the state scale. Port managing organizations prepare port development plans.\nCity municipalities accomplish territorial planning. Port territory utilization, change of purpose or assimilation of new territories is always foreseen in the city detailed plan. Port investment projects are estimated on the economic aspect, most frequently without financial estimation. The aim is not to gain profit from the port activity but broader influence on the economy while estimating the relationship between costs and profit. Impressive projects are being put into practice in all visited ports:\n1. In Kobe port the whole activity is concentrated on made-up islands, i.e. Port Island (the beginning of formation the year 1965 - the first in Japan) and Rokko Island (1982). The territories between piers situated in the old port on the coast are strewed forming new territories that are generally of non-industrial purpose: office buildings, parks, and dwelling houses. The state invests in the main infrastructure, breakwaters, capital dredging, greatest berths; the city - generally in the formation of territory, berths, covers, cranes that load cargo to the ships.\n2. Osaka port develops similarly as in Kobe port (as well as the other major ports - Tokyo, Jokohama): large islands are formed that are used for both port activity and other purposes (entertainments, business and dwelling districts). Contracts concerning the usage of new terminals are signed before the construction works. Tenders are organized where the members of the commission are the representatives of ministries, city and educational institutions. For example, in the case of the terminal that was visited, the winner has become the only one participant (Evergreen), that later invested in the cranes mounted on container reloading sites. Length of berth of the terminal - 300 m, depth of the territory (maximum distance from the berth) 600 m.\n3. Tokyo astonishes with its extensive port development scale: 300 billion yens are invested in the protective berths of one island, it is planned to increase the port island up to 400 hectares.\nDetail of Major Japanese Ports\nDetail of Major Japanese Ports\nPort of Hakata\nA major industrial port on the western side of Japan.

The Telegraph gave the TV series two stars out of five because of its \"grim\" nature and comparing it to the TV series Lost. \n\nCriticisms\n\nThe TV series represents a historic period in Australia that is considered controversial.  Some noted that there are no Indigenous Australian characters, omitting their  perspective on the advent of the colony.\nQuestion:\nWho created and wrote the 2015 TV series Banished?\nAnswer:\nJimmy McGovern\nPassage:\nWhy does the poet say that triumph and disaster are two ...\nWhy does the poet say that triumph and disaster are two imposters in the poem \"If\" by Rudyard Kipling? | eNotes\nWhy does the poet say that triumph and disaster are two imposters in the poem \"If\" by Rudyard Kipling?\ncarol-davis | College Teacher | (Level 1) Educator Emeritus\nPosted on\nOver the Wimbledon Tennis court tunnel which takes the players back to the locker room\u00a0\u00a0is this phrase:\nIf you can meet with Triumph and disaster\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same.\nWhat a wonderful poem! It is one of the most beloved poems in literature,\u00a0and its message is timeless. In the poem, \u201cIf,\u201d \u00a0Rudyard Kipling gives advice to his son on how to become a man; yet his advice rings true for everyone.\nThis poem is labeled a didactic poem because its purpose is to teach.\u00a0 In each stanza, Kipling provides guidance in some aspect of life.\nThe first stanza covers building self-confidence, never giving up, not judging other people too harshly, being patient, and loving not hating.\nIn the second stanza, the poet\u2019s instructions include always dreaming, using his \u00a0intelligence, and ignoring fools.\u00a0\nThe two lines above the Wimbledon tunnel are found in stanza 2.What do the these lines mean? Triumph\u00a0 signifies\u00a0 winning, victory, success, and achievement.Those words are easy to live with.\u00a0\u00a0 However, as the adage states, Winning is not everything.\u00a0 If a person does win a tennis match, the spelling bee, the beauty pageant--never boast\u00a0 but show sportsmanship toward the fellow competitors.\u00a0 Doing the best a person can do\u00a0is winning\u00a0no matter what the outcome.\nOn the other hand, disaster brings a different set of circumstances: tragedy, adversity, loving, misfortune, and defeat.\u00a0 Not situations that anyone finds comforting.\u00a0 With this idea comes losing with grace, remembering that he did the best he could do--\u00a0\u00a0then there is no loser.\nKipling does personify these words.\u00a0 Personification ascribes human qualities to something.\u00a0 Here these two aspects of life are given the ability to be imposters. \u00a0They are pretenders because both situations\u00a0 are fleeting [They do not last!] Winning is great, but it is only temporary.\u00a0 Thankfully, disaster is momentary as well. Everyone wants to win, \u00a0and nobody wants to lose. It is the grace that one shows in either situation that makes these imposters ludicrous.\nRemember that the \u00a0tennis players know both triumph when they\u00a0 win, and disaster when they \u00a0lose.\u00a0 There is only one winner and many losers. Each year, the athletes keep coming back to play the game that they love. These people know that it is not whether you lose or win, it is how you play the game. \u00a0Kipling ends his poem with this \u00a0assurance:\nYours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\nAnd---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!\nSources:\nQuestion:\nIn his poem \u2018If\u2019, what does Kipling describe as \u2018those two impostors\u2019?\nAnswer:\nTRIUMPH and DISASTER\nPassage:\nInterrobang\nThe interrobang (), also known as the interabang,  \u203d (often represented by ?! or !?), is a nonstandard punctuation mark used in various written languages and intended to combine the functions of the question mark (also called the \"interrogative point\")  and the exclamation mark or exclamation point (known in printers' and programmers' jargon as the \"bang\").  The glyph is a superimposition of these two marks. The word itself is an example of a portmanteau that incorporates an onomatopoeia.\n\nApplication\n\nA sentence ending with an interrobang asks a question in an excited manner, expresses excitement or disbelief in the form of a question, or asks a rhetorical question.\n\nFor example:  \n* You call that a hat\u203d\n* You're pregnant\u203d\n\nIn informal English, the same inflection is usually notated by ending a sentence with first a question mark and then an exclamation mark, or vice versa. Many people are unfamiliar with the interrobang, and would be puzzled when first seeing it, although its intention is usually self-evident. The interrobang can be hand-written with a single stroke plus the dot. One common application is in cartoons, as a stand-alone symbol of surprise.\n\nHistory\n\n \n\nMany writers, especially in informal writing, have used multiple punctuation marks to end a sentence expressing surprise and question.\n\nWhat the...?! Neves, Called Dead in Fall, Denies It (headline from San Francisco Examiner, May 9, 1936)\n\nWriters using informal language may use several alternating question marks and exclamation marks for even more emphasis:\n\nHe did what?!?!?!\nLike multiple exclamation marks and multiple question marks, such strings count as poor style in formal writing. \n\nThe combinations \"!?\" and \"?!\" are also used to express judgements of particular chess moves through their use as punctuation in chess annotation. \"!?\" denotes an \"interesting\" move, while \"?!\" denotes a \"dubious\" move.\n\nInvention\n\nAmerican Martin K. Speckter conceptualized the interrobang in 1962. As the head of an advertising agency, Speckter believed that advertisements would look better if copywriters conveyed surprised rhetorical questions using a single mark. He proposed the concept of a single punctuation mark in an article in the magazine TYPEtalks. Speckter solicited possible names for the new character from readers. Contenders included exclamaquest, QuizDing,  rhet, and exclarotive, but he settled on interrobang. He chose the name to reference the punctuation marks that inspired it: interrogatio is Latin for \"a rhetorical question\" or \"cross-examination\";  bang is printers' slang for the exclamation mark. Graphic treatments for the new mark were also submitted in response to the article.Haley, Allan. \n\nEarly interest\n\nIn 1966, Richard Isbell of American Type Founders issued the Americana typeface and included the interrobang as one of the characters. In 1968, an interrobang key was available on some Remington typewriters. During the 1970s, one could buy replacement interrobang keycaps and typefaces for some Smith-Corona typewriters. \nThe interrobang was in vogue for much of the 1960s, with the word interrobang appearing in some dictionaries and the mark itself featuring in magazine and newspaper articles.\n\nContinued support\n\nAlthough most fonts do not include the interrobang, it has not disappeared: Lucida Grande, the default font for many UI elements of legacy versions of Apple's OS X operating system, includes the interrobang, and Microsoft provides several versions of the interrobang character as part of the Wingdings 2 character set (on the right bracket and tilde keys on US keyboard layouts) available with Microsoft Office.  It was accepted into Unicode  and is present in several fonts, including Lucida Sans Unicode, Arial Unicode MS, and Calibri, the default font in the Office 2007, 2010 and 2013 suites. \n\nInverted interrobang\n\nA reverse and upside down interrobang (combining \u00bf and \u00a1, Unicode character: \u2e18), suitable for starting phrases in Spanish, Galician and Asturian, which use inverted question and exclamation marks, is called an \"inverted interrobang\" or a gnaborretni (interrobang written backwards).  In current practice, interrobang-like emphatic ambiguity in Hispanic languages is usually achieved by including both sets of punctuation marks one inside the other (\u00bf\u00a1Verdad!? or \u00a1\u00bfVerdad?! [Really!?]).  Older usage, still official but not widespread, recommended mixing the punctuation marks: \u00a1Verdad? or \u00bfVerdad! \n\nEntering and display\n\nThe interrobang is not a standard punctuation mark. Few modern typefaces or fonts include a glyph for the interrobang character. The standard interrobang is at Unicode code point .  The inverted interrobang is at Unicode code point .  Single-character versions of the double-glyph versions are also available at code points  and .\n\nThe interrobang can be used in some word processors with the alt code  when working in a font that supports the interrobang, or using an operating system that performs font substitution.\n\nDepending on the browser and which fonts the user has installed, some of these may or may not be displayed or may be substituted with a different font.\n\nOn a Linux system supporting the Compose Key, an interrobang can be produced by pressing the compose key followed by the exclamation point and the question mark; reversing the order creates the inverted interrobang.  On Mac OS X, it is found on the Character Palette, obtained by pressing the key combination .\n\nThe interrobang can be displayed in LaTeX by using the package textcomp and the command \\textinterrobang. The inverted interrobang is also provided for in the textcomp package through the command \\textinterrobangdown.\n\nProminent uses\n\nThe State Library of New South Wales, New South Wales, Australia, uses an interrobang as its logo,  as does educational publishing company Pearson, who intend it to convey \"the excitement and fun of learning\". \n\nChief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook used an interrobang in the 2012 Seventh Circuit opinion Robert F. Booth Trust v. Crowley.\nQuestion:\nThe interrobang is a punctuation mark that consist of the superimposition of an exclamation mark and what other punctuation mark?\nAnswer:\nQuestion point\nPassage:\nSpraint\nSpraint is the dung of the otter. \n\nSpraints are typically identified by smell and are known for their distinct aromas, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish.  The European otter's spraints are black and slimy,  long and deposited in groups of up to four in prominent locations near water. They contain scales, shells and bones of water creatures.  Because of the decline of otters in Britain, several surveys have been made to record the distribution of the animal, usually by recording the presence of spraint.\n  Further, there is some evidence that spraint density is correlated with otter density.\nQuestion:\nFinding its spraint means what animal has been there?\nAnswer:\nLutrinae\nPassage:\nDonnie Wahlberg\nDonald Edmond \"Donnie\" Wahlberg, Jr.  (born August 17, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter, actor, record producer, and film producer.

I understand that in this case, Tuesday becomes the public holiday.  In my business, the staff work on all three of these days.  Do I have to pay them time and a half for the Sunday, or the Monday and Tuesday, or all three?\nFirst, determine which of the days would be a normal working day for the employee if it were not Christmas. Once determined, the following applies\nIf the same staff member usually works all three days, Sunday are Monday are the public holidays. For working those two days you pay time and a half, plus allow the two alternative holidays. For them, Tuesday is not a public holiday.\nIf a staff member works just the Sunday and Monday, or just the Monday and Tuesday, then in both these cases, both days are public holidays. Pay time and a half and allow a day in lieu for each day worked.\nIf an employee usually works just the Sunday and Tuesday, then only the Sunday is a public holiday. The Tuesday is not a public holiday for this employee, because the Tuesday only becomes a public holiday if the employee does not usually work on the Sunday.\nIf an employee would only usually work one of the days between Sunday and Tuesday, then irrespective of which day it is, it is to be treated as a public holiday.\nThis is covered by Section 45 which has changed the handling of the four public holidays at Christmas and New Year.\nSection 45\nTransfer of public holidays over Christmas and New Year\n(1)  For the purposes of this subpart, if any of the public holidays listed in section 44(1)(a) to (d) (christmas and new year)\n(a)  falls on a Saturday and the day would otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on that day:\n(b)  falls on a Saturday and the day would not otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Monday:\n(c)  falls on a Sunday and the day would otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on that day:\n(d)  falls on a Sunday and the day would not otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Tuesday.\n(2)  To avoid doubt, this section does not entitle an employee to more than 4 public holidays for the days listed in section 44(1)(a) to (d) (christmas and new year).\nWhat this section effectively says is\nIf the Christmas or New Year holidays fall on a Saturday or Sunday, and the employee normally works on a Saturday or Sunday, then the Saturday or Sunday are public holidays.\nIf an employee does not usually work on the Saturday or Sunday, then the public holidays are the following Monday or Tuesday.\nMy employee works Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  We are closing on Sunday - Christmas Day but will be working every other day. What does the employee get?\nYour employee normally works Sunday, but not Monday or Tuesday.\nTherefore the Monday and Tuesday days are irrelevant.\nThey are not working on Sunday because you are closed.

It was published between 1812 and 1818 and is dedicated to \"Ianthe\". The poem describes the travels and reflections of a world-weary young man who, disillusioned with a life of pleasure and revelry, looks for distraction in foreign lands. In a wider sense, it is an expression of the melancholy and disillusionment felt by a generation weary of the wars of the post-Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. The title comes from the term childe, a medieval title for a young man who was a candidate for knighthood.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe poem contains elements thought to be autobiographical, as Byron generated some of the storyline from experience gained during his travels through Portugal, the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea between 1809 and 1811.. The \"Ianthe\" of the dedication was the term of endearment he used for Lady Charlotte Harley, about 11 years old when  Childe Harold was first published. Charlotte Bacon n\u00e9e Harley was the second daughter of 5th Earl of Oxford and Lady Oxford, Jane Elizabeth Scott. Throughout the poem Byron, in character of Childe Harold, regretted his wasted early youth, hence re-evaluating his life choices and re-designing himself through going on the pilgrimage, during which he lamented on various historical events including the Iberian Peninsular War among others.\n\nDespite Byron's initial hesitation at having the first two cantos of the poem published because he felt it revealed too much of himself,  it was published, at the urging of friends, by John Murray in 1812, and brought both the poem and its author to immediate and unexpected public attention. Byron later wrote, \"I awoke one morning and found myself famous\".  The first two cantos in John Murray's edition were illustrated by Richard Westall, well-known painter and illustrator who was then commissioned to paint portraits of Byron.\n\nByronic hero\n\nThe work provided the first example of the Byronic hero.  The idea of the Byronic hero is one that consists of many different characteristics. The hero must have a rather high level of intelligence and perception as well as be able to easily adapt to new situations and use cunning to his own gain. It is clear from this description that this hero is well-educated and by extension is rather sophisticated in his style. Aside from the obvious charm and attractiveness that this automatically creates, he struggles with his integrity, being prone to mood swings. Generally, the hero has a disrespect for certain figures of authority, thus creating the image of the Byronic hero as an exile or an outcast. The hero also has a tendency to be arrogant and cynical, indulging in self-destructive behaviour which leads to the need to seduce women. Although his sexual attraction through being mysterious is rather helpful, it often gets the hero into trouble. Characters with the qualities of the Byronic hero have appeared in novels, films and plays ever since.\n\nStructure\n\nThe poem has four cantos written in Spenserian stanzas, which consist of eight iambic pentameter lines followed by one alexandrine (a twelve syllable iambic line), and has rhyme pattern ABABBCBCC.\n\nInterpretations\n\nChilde Harold became a vehicle for Byron's own beliefs and ideas, but in the preface to canto four Byron complains that his readers conflate him and Child Harold too much, so he will not speak of Harold as much in the final canto.

Emilius read the first half of the fourth canto of this poem to Lizzie Eustace.\nQuestion:\nWhich lengthy narrative poem by Lord Byron describes the trials and reflections of a world weary young man?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nScottish Blackface\nThe Scottish Blackface is the most common breed of domestic sheep in the United Kingdom. This tough and adaptable breed is often found in the more exposed locations, such as the Scottish Highlands or roaming on the moors of Dartmoor. It is also known as Blackfaced Highland, Kerry, Linton, Scottish Mountain, Scottish Highland, Scotch Blackface and Scotch Horn. \n \nBlackfaces are horned in both sexes, and as their name suggests, they usually have a black face (but sometimes with white markings), and black legs.   This breed is primarily raised for meat. \n\nHistory\n\nThe origins of the breed are uncertain. It was developed on the Anglo-Scottish border but it is not clear exactly when it became a distinct breed. It replaced the earlier Scottish Dunface or Old Scottish Short-wool, a Northern European short-tailed sheep type probably similar to the modern Shetland. \n\nRecords show that in 1503 James IV of Scotland established a flock of 5,000 Scottish Blackface Sheep in Ettrick Forest in the area south of Peebles in the Borders.\n\nToday the Blackface is the most numerous breed in the British Isles.  Roughly thirty percent of all sheep in the UK are Scottish Blackface. The Blackface epitomises the mountain sheep. They have long coarse wool that shields them from moisture and biting winds. They are able to survive the harshest winters in the most extreme parts of Great Britain. \n\nSeveral types of Scottish Blackface have developed over the years, but the most common are the Perth variety, which is large framed, with a longer coat, and mainly found in north-east Scotland, Devon, Cornwall and Northern Ireland, and the medium-framed Lanark type, with shorter wool, commonly found in Scotland and Ireland. \n\nThe introduction of Black Faced Highland sheep to America  first occurred in June, 1861, Hugh Brodie imported one ram and two ewes for Brodie & Campbell, New York Mills, New York. In 1867 this flock and  increase was purchased by T. L. Harison of Morley, St. Lawrence County, New York. Isaac Stickney of New York also imported a small flock about 1867 for his farm in Illinois.\n\nBlackface ewes are excellent mothers and will often attempt to defend their lambs against predators.  They are good milkers and are able to yield a lamb crop and a wool clip even when on marginal pastures. The breed spread from the border areas during the 19th century to the highlands and the Scottish islands. They also crossed to Northern Ireland and the US. There are flocks scattered across the USA but this robust little breed has remained a minor breed in North America. Blackface lambs yield a carcass ideal for the modern consumer. The meat is free of superfluous fat and waste and is known the world over for its distinct flavour. Although they are not large sheep they have enormous potential for the production of high quality lean lamb for today's health conscious consumer. There has never been a case of natural occurring Scrapie in a Scottish Blackface Sheep. In a controlled study in the UK goats and Blackface where infected by researchers but there is not one documented case of naturally spread scrapie in a Blackface raised in the USA or the UK. Scrapie, an invariably fatal disease of sheep and goats, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The putative infectious agent is the host-encoded prion protein, PrP.\n\nScottish Blackface wool\n\nScottish Blackface wool is a speciality wool in a class of its own. There are variations in type of fleece according to the way the sheep were bred. In general, there are a southwest type (short wool) and a central Scotland type (long wool). The southwest type is the finer, with a Bradford count of forty or so, generally classed as short or medium: ewe's fleece of 3 to 4\u00bd\u00a0lb, greasy. The central type is a stronger wool classed as long or deep strong; this type gives a ewe fleece of 5 to 6\u00bd\u00a0lb, greasy. The main markets are the mattress and upholstery trade, carpet and heavy cloth trade. Strong Blackface wool undoubtedly makes the best mattress filling there is: the demand for this is very good. The carpet trade all over the world (even New Zealand and Australia) uses large quantities of the medium class of Scottish Blackface wool.\nThe finer wools are used for blending into many of the strong wearing clothes, over-coating,working tweeds and heavy blankets, The finest Scottish Blackface wool goes to the famous Harris tweed trade.\n \nThe [http://www.sheepusa.org American Sheep Industry Association] reports an average fibre diameter of 38 to 28 micrometres (or microns), and staple length of 10 to. \n\nArtisans have long treasured the horns of the Blackface for the carving of shepherd's crooks and walking sticks. In the US the fleeces are becoming of interest to fibre artists and hand spinners for use in tapestry and the making of rugs and saddle blankets.\nQuestion:\nScottish Blackface is a breed of which animal?\nAnswer:\nSheep\nPassage:\nStompie Moeketsi\nJames Seipei (1974\u20131989), also known as Stompie Moeketsi, was a teenage United Democratic Front (UDF) activist from Parys in South Africa. He and three other boys were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 by members of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United football club. Moeketsi was murdered on 1 January 1989, the only one of the boys to be killed. \n\nActivism\n\nMoeketsi joined the street uprising against apartheid in the mid-1980s at age ten, and soon took on a leading role. He became the country's youngest political detainee when he spent his 12th birthday in jail without trial.  At the age of 13 he was expelled from school.\n\nMurder\n\nMoeketsi, together with Kenny Kgase, Pelo Mekgwe and Thabiso Mono, were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 from the Methodist manse in Orlando, Soweto. Moeketsi was accused of being a police informer and after the 4 boys were kidnapped they were pleading and saying that Stompie isn't a police informer. Jerry Richardson, one of the members of Winnie Mandela's Football Club, was carrying a samurai-like sword before he closed the door and screams were heard as Stompie Moeketsi was murdered at the age of 14. His body was found on waste ground near Winnie Mandela's house on 6 January 1989, and recovered by the police. His throat had been cut. Jerry Richardson, one of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was convicted of the murder. He claimed that she had ordered him, with others, to abduct the four youths from Soweto, of whom Moeketsi was the youngest. The four were severely beaten.\n\nInvolvement of Winnie Mandela\n\nIn 1991, Winnie Mandela was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault,  but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine and a two-year suspended sentence on appeal. In 1992 she was accused of ordering the murder of Dr. Abu-Baker Asvat, a family friend who had examined Seipei at Mandela's house, after Seipei had been abducted but before he had been killed.  Mandela's role was later probed as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, in 1997.  She was said to have paid the equivalent of $8,000 and supplied the firearm used in the killing, which took place on 27 January 1989.  The hearings were later adjourned amid claims that witnesses were being intimidated on Winnie Mandela's orders. \n\nThis incident became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the apartheid government and opponents of the ANC, and Winnie Mandela's iconic status was dealt a heavy blow.\n\nAppearing before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997, she said allegations that she was involved in at least 18 human rights abuses including eight murders were \"ridiculous\" and claimed that her main accuser, former comrade Katiza Cebekhulu, was a former \"mental patient\" and his allegations against her were \"hallucinations\".  The Commission found that the abduction had been carried out on Winnie Mandela's instructions, and that she had \"initiated and participated in the assaults\". However, with regard to the actual murder the Commission found Mandela only \"negligent\".\nQuestion:\nWhich famous name was accused f the abduction of Stompie Seipei?\nAnswer:\nNomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela\nPassage:\nMens sana in corpore sano\nMens sana in corpore sano is a Latin phrase, usually translated as \"a sound mind in a sound body\" or \"a healthy mind in a healthy body\".\n\nIn the western world, the phrase is widely used in sporting and educational contexts to express the theory that physical exercise is an important or essential part of mental and psychological well-being.\n\nHistory\n\nThe phrase comes from Satire X of the Roman poet Juvenal (10.356).  It is the first in a list of what is desirable in life:\n\nTraditional commentators believe that Juvenal's intention was to teach his fellow Roman citizens that in the main, their prayers for such things as long life are misguided. That the gods had provided man with virtues which he then lists for them.\n\nOver time and separated from its context, the phrase has come to have a range of meanings.  It can be construed to mean that only a healthy mind can lead to a healthy body, or equally that only a healthy body can produce or sustain a healthy mind.  Its most general usage is to express the hierarchy of needs: with physical and mental health at the root.\n\nAn earlier, similar saying is attributed to the pre-Socratic philosopher Thales:\n\n\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd, \"\u1f41 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f51\u03b3\u03b9\u03ae\u03c2, \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u03b5\u1f54\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\"\nWhat man is happy? \"He who has a healthy body, a resourceful mind and a docile nature.\" \n\nUsages\n\n* Usage in other writings\n** John Locke (1632\u20131704) uses the phrase in his book Some Thoughts Concerning Education.\n** Heinrich von Treitschke used this phrase in his work titled The Army.

Sometimes they wear a pointed cap or hat and may be smoking a pipe.\nLeprechaun lore\nIn their book \"The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures,\" John and Caitlin Matthews trace leprechaun legends back to eighth-century legends of water spirits called \"luchorp\u00e1n,\" meaning small body. These sprites eventually merged with a mischievous household fairy said to haunt cellars and drink heavily.\nOther researchers say that the word leprechaun may be derived from the Irish leath bhrogan, meaning shoemaker. Indeed, though leprechauns are often associated with riches and gold, in folklore their main vocation is anything but glamorous: they are humble cobblers, or shoemakers. Shoemaking is apparently a lucrative business in the fairy world, since each leprechaun is said to have his own pot of gold, which can often be found at the end of a rainbow.\nAccording to Irish legends, people lucky enough to find a leprechaun and capture him (or, in some stories, steal his magical ring, coin or amulet) can barter his freedom for his treasure. Leprechauns are usually said to be able to grant the person three wishes. But dealing with leprechauns can be a tricky proposition.\nA trickster\nThe leprechaun plays several roles in Irish folklore; he is principally a roguish trickster figure who cannot be trusted and will deceive whenever possible. In her encyclopedia \"Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns, and Goblins,\" folklorist Carol Rose offers a typical tale of leprechaun trickery \"concerning a man who managed to get a leprechaun to show him the bush in the field where his treasure was located. Having no spade [shovel], the man marked the tree with one of his red garters, then kindly released the sprite and went for a spade. Returning almost instantly he found that every one of the numerous trees in the field sported a red garter!\"\nIn the magical world, most spirits, fairies and other creatures have a distinctive sound that is associated with them. Some entities \u2014 such as the Irish fairy banshee and the Hispanic spirit La Llorona \u2014 are said to emit a mournful wail signifying their presence. In the case of the leprechaun, it's the tap-tap-tapping of his tiny cobbler hammer, driving nails into shoes, that announces they are near.\nIn his collection of Irish fairy and folk tales, W.B. Yeats offered an 18th-century poem by William Allingham titled \"The Lepracaun; Or, Fairy Shoemaker\" which describes the sound:\n\"Lay your ear close to the hill.\nDo you not catch the tiny clamour,\nBusy click of an elfin hammer,\nVoice of the Lepracaun singing shrill\nAs he merrily plies his trade?\"\nThe 1825 publication of a book called \"Fairy Legends\" seemingly cemented the character of the modern leprechaun: \"Since that time leprechauns seem to be entirely male and solitary,\" they note.\nIt seems that all leprechauns are not only shoemakers but also old male loners, which makes sense from a cultural standpoint, since that type of fairy is so closely associated with shoemaking, a traditionally male vocation. Though there is something curious about all leprechauns being cobblers (what if they want to be writers, farmers, or doctors?), this designation also fits in well with the traditional folkloric division of labor among fairies.\nLeprechauns in popular culture\nAs with many old legends and traditions, the image and nature of the leprechaun has changed over time and has been updated (and in some cases sanitized) for a modern audience. Lucky the Leprechaun, mascot of the General Mills breakfast cereal Lucky Charms, is probably the best-known fairy of his type.\nOn the other end of the spectrum there's the homicidal leprechaun Lubdan in the \"Leprechaun\" horror/comedy film series (played by \"Willow\" actor Warwick Davis). For generations, some Irish have been annoyed by leprechauns and the ethnic stereotypes they perpetuate, and for most Americans leprechauns only appear around St. Patrick's Day .\nLeprechauns offer a morality tale figure whose fables warn against the folly of trying to get rich quick, take what's not rightfully yours or interfere with \"The Good Folk\" and other magical creatures. Belief in leprechauns and other fairies was once widespread on the Emerald Isle , and real or not they will continue to amuse and delight us for centuries more.\nBenjamin Radford is deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine and author of six books including \"Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore.\" His Web site is www.BenjaminRadford.com.\nAuthor Bio\nBenjamin Radford, Live Science Contributor\nBenjamin Radford is the Bad Science columnist for Live Science.

Lowell Observatory was established in 1894, placing it among the oldest observatories in the United States, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.  In 2011, the Observatory was named one of \"The World's 100 Most Important Places\" by TIME. It was at the Lowell Observatory that the dwarf planet Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh.\n\nThe Observatory's original 24 in Alvan Clark & Sons Telescope is still in use today for public education. Lowell Observatory hosts 85,000 visitors per year at their Steele Visitors Center, who take guided daytime tours and view various wonders of the night sky through the Clark Telescope and other telescopes. It was founded by astronomer Percival Lowell of Boston's well-known Lowell family and is overseen by a sole trustee, a position historically handed down through the family. The first trustee was Lowell's third cousin Guy Lowell (1916\u20131927). Percival's nephew Roger Putnam served from 1927\u20131967, followed by Roger's son Michael (1967\u20131987), Michael's brother William Lowell Putnam III (1987\u20132013), and current trustee W. Lowell Putnam.\n\nThe observatory operates several telescopes at three locations in the Flagstaff area. The main facility, located on Mars Hill just west of downtown Flagstaff, houses the original 24 in Clark Refracting Telescope, although its role today is as a public education tool and not research. The telescope, built in 1896 for $20,000, was assembled in Boston by Alvan Clark & Sons and then shipped by train to Flagstaff. Also located on the Mars Hill campus is the 13 in Pluto Discovery Telescope, used by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 to discover the dwarf planet Pluto.\n\nLowell Observatory currently operates four research telescopes at its Anderson Mesa dark sky site, located 20 km southeast of Flagstaff, including the 72 in Perkins Telescope (in partnership with Boston University) and the 42 in John S. Hall Telescope. Lowell is a partner with the United States Naval Observatory and Naval Research Laboratory in the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) also located at that site. The Observatory also operates smaller research telescopes at its historic site on Mars Hill and in Australia and Chile.\n\nPast Anderson Mesa, on the peak of Happy Jack, Lowell Observatory has also built and is commissioning the  Discovery Channel Telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, Inc.\n\nHistory (see discoveries below)\n\nAside from the wide array of research and discoveries listed below, one science program carried out at the Observatory was the measurement of the variability of solar irradiance.  When Harold L. Johnson took over as the director in 1952, the stated objective became to focus on light from the Sun reflecting from Uranus and Neptune. In 1953, the current 21 in telescope was erected. Beginning in 1954, this telescope began monitoring the brightness of these two planets, and comparing these measurements with a reference set of sunlike stars.\n\nFile:Percival_Lowell_observing_Venus_from_the_Lowell_Observatory_in_1914.jpg|Percival Lowell in the observer's chair of the Alvan Clark 24 in refractor \nFile:Lowell Observatory - Clark telescope.jpg|Alvan Clark refractor telescope, the first permanent telescope at Lowell Observatory\nFile:Lowell astrograph.jpg|13 in astrograph used to discover Pluto\n\nDiscovery Channel Telescope (DCT)  \n\nLowell Observatory is building a major new reflecting telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, located near Happy Jack, Arizona. This Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT), located within the Mogollon Rim Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest, is expected to be the fifth-largest telescope in the contiguous United States, and it will enable the astronomers of Lowell Observatory to enter new research areas deeper into outer space.\n\nThe DCT and the research carried out there will be the focus of ongoing informative and educational television programs about astronomy, the sciences, and technology to be telecast on the Discovery channels. The primary mirror of the Discovery Channel Telescope will be  in diameter. It will be supposely notable for its uncommon meniscus design for such a large mirror. This mirror was ground and polished into its parabolic shape at the Optical Fabrication and Engineering Facility of the College of Optical Sciences of the University of Arizona (in Tucson, Arizona).\n\nCurrent research \n\nLowell Observatory's astronomers conduct research on a wide range of solar system and astrophysical topics using ground-based, airborne, and space-based telescopes. Among the many current programs are a search for near-Earth asteroids, a survey of the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, a search for extrasolar planets, a decades-long study of the brightness stability of the sun, and a variety of investigations of star formation and other processes in distant galaxies. In addition, the Observatory staff designs and builds custom instrumentation for use on Lowell's telescopes and elsewhere. For example, Lowell staff built a sophisticated high-speed camera for use on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). SOFIA is a joint project of the United States and German space agencies and consists of a  telescope on board a Boeing 747 SP.\n\nNotable discoveries \n\n*The dwarf planet Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930\n*Large recessional velocities of galaxies by Vesto Melvin Slipher between 1912 and 1914 (that led ultimately to the realization our universe is expanding)\n*Co-discovery of the rings of Uranus in 1977\n*The periodic variation in the activity of Comet Halley during the 1985/1986 apparition \n*The three largest known stars\n*The atmosphere of Pluto\n*Accurate orbits for two of Pluto's moons: Nix and Hydra\n*Oxygen on Jupiter's satellite Ganymede\n*Carbon dioxide ice on three Uranian satellites\n*The first Trojan of Neptune\n*Evidence that the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contains water vapor\nQuestion:\nWhat was first seen at Lowell Observatory in 1930?\nAnswer:\n134340 Pluto.\nPassage:\nTiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn\nTiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn (literally, \"Sch\u00f6nbrunn Zoo\"), or \"Vienna Zoo\", is a zoo located on the grounds of the famous Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria. Founded as an imperial menagerie in 1752, it is the oldest zoo in the world.\nToday, Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn is considered and regards itself as a scientifically administered zoo which sees its main purpose as a centre for species conservation and general nature conservation as well as in the fulfillment of the education mandate given to it by the legislation. The still preserved buildings of the baroque era, which have been complemented in the last years by elements of modern zoo architecture, still convey a good impression of the 18th century menagerie-buildings after the Versailles model.\n\nDescription\n\nTiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn is one of the few zoos worldwide to house giant pandas.  The zoo's pandas are named Yang Yang (F), Long Hui (M), Fu Long (M), and Fu Hu (M).   Fu Long's birth on 23 August 2007 was the first natural insemination panda birth in Europe.   Fu Hu was born exactly 3 years later, and he was also conceived by natural mating.  One more panda cub, Fu Bao (\u798f\u8c79), was born nearly three years later on 14 August 2013 via natural mating. \n\nOther zoo attractions include a rainforest house, in which the spectator is led through a simulation of the Amazon rainforest, an aquarium, which enables  spectators to walk through underneath a simulation of the Amazon in flood, and, more recently, an exhibit of animals in unnatural habitats.  The new polarium for animals of the Arctic region was opened in early 2004.\n\nOn 14 July 1906, the zoo saw the birth of the first elephant in captivity. \n\nFrom its privatization in 1992, it has been led by Helmut Pechlaner, also president of WWF Austria, who managed to modernize most parts of the zoo and sustain its financial situation. Nowadays, as of 2014, the zoo is managed by Dagmar Schratter.\n\nPrivate and corporate sponsorship for the various animals is one of the methods employed by the zoo today, along with bookable night excursions and special children's programs. Zoological research takes place at the zoo.\n\nHistory\n\nThe zoo was constructed in 1752 next to Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn by Adrian van Stekhoven at the order of the then Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I, husband of Maria Theresia, to serve as an imperial menagerie. It was centered around a pavilion meant for imperial breakfasts. Therefore, thirteen animal enclosures in the form of cut cake pieces were established around this central pavilion.\n\nThe central pavilions and the menagerie building were built by Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey. A small zoo had already existed on the premises since 1540, but the complex was opened to the public only in 1779. Initially, there were no entrance fees.\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Joseph II organized expeditions to Africa and the Americas to procure specimens for the zoo. The arrival of the first giraffe in 1828 influenced Viennese fashion and city life. Clothes', accessories', and other items' designs were influenced, and Adolf B\u00e4uerle performed his play titled Giraffes in Vienna ().\n\nAt the onset of World War I, the zoo was home to 712 species and 3,500 specimens. Due to diminishing food supplies during the war, the number of specimens rapidly sank to 900. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the war, the zoo became the responsibility of the Austrian Republic.\n\nBombing raids on February 19 and February 21, 1945, during World War II, had an even greater impact on the zoo. Many buildings were destroyed and specimens killed, reducing the stock of specimens to 400. The new zoo director, Dr. Julius Brachetka, eventually managed to restore the zoo.\n\nThe zoo experienced a financial crisis in the 1980s, but closure of the zoo was prevented by privatization in 1992. Dr. Helmut Pechlaner was assigned as manager of the zoo. After his retirement on 1 January 2007, his deputy, Dr. Dagmar Schratter, took over his post.\n\nPechlaner was able to renovate and extend many of the enclosures thanks to a number of sponsors and significantly increased entrance fees. During his time as manager, the zoo was extended by a number of new buildings, including the rainforest house, the desert house, and the \"Tyrolean farmhouse\". A number of rare and exotic specimens, such as giant pandas and koalas, were attracted to the zoo and contributed to its upswing in popularity.\n\nIn the media\n\nA number of tragic accidents have plagued the zoo. In 2002, a jaguar attacked a caretaker during feeding, killing her in front of zoo visitors. The director tried to help and sustained heavy arm injuries. In February 2005, a young elephant, Abu, lethally crushed his caretaker. In the following press storm, director Pechlaner offered to resign over the issue. \n\nThe zoo is a filming location for the ORF series, Tom Turbo, which is based on a series of children's books by Thomas Brezina. Tom Turbo has its garage at the zoo since 2006, and is, together with its creator, sponsor of a tiger at the zoo. Former zoo director Pechlaner makes cameo appearances in a number of episodes.\n\nThe 250 Years Vienna Zoo Silver Coin\n\nThe zoo is so popular and famous that on its 250th anniversary, it was the topic of one of the most famous silver collectors' coins: the 5 euro 250 Years of Vienna Zoo commemorative coin minted on 8 May 2002.\n\nThe reverse shows the Emperor's Pavilion surrounded by a variety of animals from the zoo. The dates 1752-2002 refer to the anniversary and, of course, date the coin itself.\n\nLiterature \n\n* Ash, Mitchell and Dittrich, Lothar (ed.), Menagerie des Kaisers \u2013 Zoo der Wiener, Pichler Verlag, Vienna, 2002.

In South China Cinnamomum loureiroi and Mandarin orange peel is commonly used as a substitute for Cinnamomum cassia and cloves, respectively, producing a different flavour for southern five-spice powders.\n\nUse\n\nFive spice may be used with fatty meats such as pork, duck or goose. It is used as a spice rub for chicken, duck, pork and seafood, in red cooking recipes, or added to the breading for fried foods. Five spice is used in recipes for Cantonese roasted duck, as well as beef stew. It is used as a marinade for Vietnamese broiled chicken. The five-spice powder mixture has followed the Chinese diaspora and has been incorporated into other national cuisines throughout Asia.\n\nAlthough this mixture is used in restaurant cooking, many Chinese households do not use it in day-to-day cooking.  In Hawaii, some restaurants place a shaker of the spice on each patron's table. A seasoned salt can be easily made by dry-roasting common salt with five-spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.\nQuestion:\nFive spice powder is commonly used in which ethnic cuisine?\nAnswer:\nChine\u017fe\nPassage:\nSinger - Cars By Brand, Manufacturer Marques & Models ...\nSinger - Cars By Brand, Manufacturer Marques & Models | Classic Cars For Sale Magazine\nSinger\nThe first Singer cars - built under licence from Lea-Francis and designed by Alex Craig - were produced in 1905 by George Singer, who had worked for Coventry Machinists before producing cycle, tricycles and then cars.\nSinger died a year after the company went into receivership (in 1908) and the firm was re-established as Singer and Co.

For 1966, the excellent Singer Chamois Sport arrived using the same peppy Imp Sport spec, while there was even a coupe based upon the Sunbeam Stiletto. For 1969, the Chamois featured quadruple headlamps but range was killed off just a year later.\nSinger Gazelle (To 1967)\nQuestion:\nWhich car company made the Chamois and Gazelle models?\nAnswer:\nLead (music)\nPassage:\nSaussurea\nSaussurea is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the thistle tribe within the daisy family, native to cool temperate and arctic regions of Asia, Europe, and North America, with the highest diversity in alpine habitats in the Himalaya and central Asia. Common names include saw-wort and snow lotus, the latter used for a number of high altitude species in central Asia.\n\nThey are perennial herbaceous plants, ranging in height from dwarf alpine species 5\u201310\u00a0cm tall, to tall thistle-like plants up to 3 m tall. The leaves are produced in a dense basal rosette, and then spirally up the flowering stem. The flowers form in a dense head of small capitula, often surrounded by dense white to purple woolly hairs; the individual florets are also white to purple. The wool is densest in the high altitude species, and aid in thermoregulation of the flowers, minimising frost damage at night, and also preventing ultraviolet light damage from the intense high altitude sunlight.\n\nDe Candolle named the genus after Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure (1740-1799) and Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure (1767\u20131845). \n\nUses\n\nA number of the high alpine Himalayan species are grown as ornamental plants for their decorative dense woolly flowerheads; they are among the most challenging plants to grow, being adapted to harsh climates from 3500\u20135000 m altitude, demanding cool temperatures, a very long (up to 8\u201310 months) winter rest period, and very good soil drainage in humus-rich gravel soils.\n\nTraditional uses \n\nCosti amari radix or costus root was an important item of Roman trade with India, and is believed to have been the dried root of Saussurea lappa. \n\nSeveral varieties of snow lotus are used in traditional Tibetan medicine. Saussurea lappa is used a component of the traditional Tibetan medicine Padma 28.  Research conducted on the Himalayan medicinal plants by C.P. Kala reveals that the practitioners of Tibetan medicine living in the Pin Valley of Himachal Pradesh use its root for curing dysentery and ulcer.  Saussurea involucrata flowers and stems have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cough with cold, stomachache, dysmenorrhea, and altitude sickness, and has been found to have antiinflammatory, cardiotonic, abortifacient, anticancer, and antifatigue actions. \n\nSaussurea obvallata, known as \"brahmakamala\" in India is one of the most sacred species, and it has been used for offerings to goddess Nanda Devi for time immemorial.  \n\nPharmacology\n\nSaussurea lappa and has been shown to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS by lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages, thus reducing nitric oxide production.  In rats, high doses of 50-200 milligrams per kilogram of crude ethanolic extract reduced observed inflammation in standard laboratory tests, and 25-100 milligrams per kilogram of the sesquiterpene fraction of the extract reduced several molecular markers of inflammation.    Ethanol extracts were shown to have analgesic and antiinflammatory effects at high doses of 75-300 milligrams per kilogram.  As the slow-growing wild plant is endangered by collections, a substitute grown in tissue culture has been suggested, which is mostly equivalent.  Generally the analgesic and antiinflammatory effects of the plant are much inferior to those of 10 milligrams of indomethacin.\n\nLiterature and culture\n\nIn most Chinese martial arts literature, the snow Lotus was classified a rare herb as precious as lingzhi mushroom, and old ginseng.\n\nSelected species\n\n*Saussurea abnormis.

The development of most significant for economics Japanese ports is financed 2/3 by government means; the remaining part is financed by port-managing organizations. Ministry of land infrastructure and transport in Japan can provide with stock capital for the securities that are issued by port-managing organizations if the project that is being carried into effect is important on the state scale. Port managing organizations prepare port development plans.\nCity municipalities accomplish territorial planning. Port territory utilization, change of purpose or assimilation of new territories is always foreseen in the city detailed plan. Port investment projects are estimated on the economic aspect, most frequently without financial estimation. The aim is not to gain profit from the port activity but broader influence on the economy while estimating the relationship between costs and profit. Impressive projects are being put into practice in all visited ports:\n1. In Kobe port the whole activity is concentrated on made-up islands, i.e. Port Island (the beginning of formation the year 1965 - the first in Japan) and Rokko Island (1982). The territories between piers situated in the old port on the coast are strewed forming new territories that are generally of non-industrial purpose: office buildings, parks, and dwelling houses. The state invests in the main infrastructure, breakwaters, capital dredging, greatest berths; the city - generally in the formation of territory, berths, covers, cranes that load cargo to the ships.\n2. Osaka port develops similarly as in Kobe port (as well as the other major ports - Tokyo, Jokohama): large islands are formed that are used for both port activity and other purposes (entertainments, business and dwelling districts). Contracts concerning the usage of new terminals are signed before the construction works. Tenders are organized where the members of the commission are the representatives of ministries, city and educational institutions. For example, in the case of the terminal that was visited, the winner has become the only one participant (Evergreen), that later invested in the cranes mounted on container reloading sites. Length of berth of the terminal - 300 m, depth of the territory (maximum distance from the berth) 600 m.\n3. Tokyo astonishes with its extensive port development scale: 300 billion yens are invested in the protective berths of one island, it is planned to increase the port island up to 400 hectares.\nDetail of Major Japanese Ports\nDetail of Major Japanese Ports\nPort of Hakata\nA major industrial port on the western side of Japan.

The seven-part serial first aired on 5 March 2015 on BBC Two and was inspired by events in the eighteenth century when Britain established a penal colony in Australia.  \n\nIt has been announced that Banished will not be returning for a second series.\n\nPlot\n\nSet in the first penal colony founded by the British in New South Wales in the year 1788, in which the British convicts live alongside their Royal Navy marine guards and their officers. A thousand prisoners are guarded by one hundred men, and with five men for every woman, tensions are high when the women are shared among the men.\n\nProduction\n\nThe series, a co-production between RSJ Films and See-Saw Films, was co-commissioned by BBC Two and BBC Worldwide. The commissioners for BBC Two are Ben Stephenson and Janice Hadlow. Filming took place in Sydney in April 2014 and Manchester afterwards.

It was BBC2\u2019s second biggest new drama launch for several years, behind Wolf Hall, which began in January with an overnight audience of 3.9 million. \n\nThe Guardian newspaper has named the series \"I'm a Convict, Get me Out of Here!\" with reference to the reality TV series I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.  The Telegraph gave the TV series two stars out of five because of its \"grim\" nature and comparing it to the TV series Lost. \n\nCriticisms\n\nThe TV series represents a historic period in Australia that is considered controversial.  Some noted that there are no Indigenous Australian characters, omitting their  perspective on the advent of the colony.\nQuestion:\nWho created and wrote the 2015 TV series Banished?\nAnswer:\nJimmy McGovern\nPassage:\nWhy does the poet say that triumph and disaster are two ...\nWhy does the poet say that triumph and disaster are two imposters in the poem \"If\" by Rudyard Kipling? | eNotes\nWhy does the poet say that triumph and disaster are two imposters in the poem \"If\" by Rudyard Kipling?\ncarol-davis | College Teacher | (Level 1) Educator Emeritus\nPosted on\nOver the Wimbledon Tennis court tunnel which takes the players back to the locker room\u00a0\u00a0is this phrase:\nIf you can meet with Triumph and disaster\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same.\nWhat a wonderful poem! It is one of the most beloved poems in literature,\u00a0and its message is timeless. In the poem, \u201cIf,\u201d \u00a0Rudyard Kipling gives advice to his son on how to become a man; yet his advice rings true for everyone.\nThis poem is labeled a didactic poem because its purpose is to teach.\u00a0 In each stanza, Kipling provides guidance in some aspect of life.\nThe first stanza covers building self-confidence, never giving up, not judging other people too harshly, being patient, and loving not hating.\nIn the second stanza, the poet\u2019s instructions include always dreaming, using his \u00a0intelligence, and ignoring fools.\u00a0\nThe two lines above the Wimbledon tunnel are found in stanza 2.What do the these lines mean? Triumph\u00a0 signifies\u00a0 winning, victory, success, and achievement.Those words are easy to live with.\u00a0\u00a0 However, as the adage states, Winning is not everything.\u00a0 If a person does win a tennis match, the spelling bee, the beauty pageant--never boast\u00a0 but show sportsmanship toward the fellow competitors.\u00a0 Doing the best a person can do\u00a0is winning\u00a0no matter what the outcome.\nOn the other hand, disaster brings a different set of circumstances: tragedy, adversity, loving, misfortune, and defeat.\u00a0 Not situations that anyone finds comforting.\u00a0 With this idea comes losing with grace, remembering that he did the best he could do--\u00a0\u00a0then there is no loser.\nKipling does personify these words.\u00a0 Personification ascribes human qualities to something.\u00a0 Here these two aspects of life are given the ability to be imposters. \u00a0They are pretenders because both situations\u00a0 are fleeting [They do not last!] Winning is great, but it is only temporary.\u00a0 Thankfully, disaster is momentary as well. Everyone wants to win, \u00a0and nobody wants to lose. It is the grace that one shows in either situation that makes these imposters ludicrous.\nRemember that the \u00a0tennis players know both triumph when they\u00a0 win, and disaster when they \u00a0lose.\u00a0 There is only one winner and many losers. Each year, the athletes keep coming back to play the game that they love. These people know that it is not whether you lose or win, it is how you play the game. \u00a0Kipling ends his poem with this \u00a0assurance:\nYours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\nAnd---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!\nSources:\nQuestion:\nIn his poem \u2018If\u2019, what does Kipling describe as \u2018those two impostors\u2019?\nAnswer:\nTRIUMPH and DISASTER\nPassage:\nInterrobang\nThe interrobang (), also known as the interabang,  \u203d (often represented by ?! or !?), is a nonstandard punctuation mark used in various written languages and intended to combine the functions of the question mark (also called the \"interrogative point\")  and the exclamation mark or exclamation point (known in printers' and programmers' jargon as the \"bang\").  The glyph is a superimposition of these two marks. The word itself is an example of a portmanteau that incorporates an onomatopoeia.\n\nApplication\n\nA sentence ending with an interrobang asks a question in an excited manner, expresses excitement or disbelief in the form of a question, or asks a rhetorical question.\n\nFor example:  \n* You call that a hat\u203d\n* You're pregnant\u203d\n\nIn informal English, the same inflection is usually notated by ending a sentence with first a question mark and then an exclamation mark, or vice versa. Many people are unfamiliar with the interrobang, and would be puzzled when first seeing it, although its intention is usually self-evident. The interrobang can be hand-written with a single stroke plus the dot. One common application is in cartoons, as a stand-alone symbol of surprise.\n\nHistory\n\n \n\nMany writers, especially in informal writing, have used multiple punctuation marks to end a sentence expressing surprise and question.\n\nWhat the...?! Neves, Called Dead in Fall, Denies It (headline from San Francisco Examiner, May 9, 1936)\n\nWriters using informal language may use several alternating question marks and exclamation marks for even more emphasis:\n\nHe did what?!?!?!\nLike multiple exclamation marks and multiple question marks, such strings count as poor style in formal writing. \n\nThe combinations \"!?\" and \"?!\" are also used to express judgements of particular chess moves through their use as punctuation in chess annotation. \"!?\" denotes an \"interesting\" move, while \"?!\" denotes a \"dubious\" move.\n\nInvention\n\nAmerican Martin K. Speckter conceptualized the interrobang in 1962. As the head of an advertising agency, Speckter believed that advertisements would look better if copywriters conveyed surprised rhetorical questions using a single mark. He proposed the concept of a single punctuation mark in an article in the magazine TYPEtalks. Speckter solicited possible names for the new character from readers. Contenders included exclamaquest, QuizDing,  rhet, and exclarotive, but he settled on interrobang. He chose the name to reference the punctuation marks that inspired it: interrogatio is Latin for \"a rhetorical question\" or \"cross-examination\";  bang is printers' slang for the exclamation mark. Graphic treatments for the new mark were also submitted in response to the article.Haley, Allan. \n\nEarly interest\n\nIn 1966, Richard Isbell of American Type Founders issued the Americana typeface and included the interrobang as one of the characters. In 1968, an interrobang key was available on some Remington typewriters. During the 1970s, one could buy replacement interrobang keycaps and typefaces for some Smith-Corona typewriters. \nThe interrobang was in vogue for much of the 1960s, with the word interrobang appearing in some dictionaries and the mark itself featuring in magazine and newspaper articles.\n\nContinued support\n\nAlthough most fonts do not include the interrobang, it has not disappeared: Lucida Grande, the default font for many UI elements of legacy versions of Apple's OS X operating system, includes the interrobang, and Microsoft provides several versions of the interrobang character as part of the Wingdings 2 character set (on the right bracket and tilde keys on US keyboard layouts) available with Microsoft Office.  It was accepted into Unicode  and is present in several fonts, including Lucida Sans Unicode, Arial Unicode MS, and Calibri, the default font in the Office 2007, 2010 and 2013 suites. \n\nInverted interrobang\n\nA reverse and upside down interrobang (combining \u00bf and \u00a1, Unicode character: \u2e18), suitable for starting phrases in Spanish, Galician and Asturian, which use inverted question and exclamation marks, is called an \"inverted interrobang\" or a gnaborretni (interrobang written backwards).  In current practice, interrobang-like emphatic ambiguity in Hispanic languages is usually achieved by including both sets of punctuation marks one inside the other (\u00bf\u00a1Verdad!? or \u00a1\u00bfVerdad?! [Really!?]).  Older usage, still official but not widespread, recommended mixing the punctuation marks: \u00a1Verdad? or \u00bfVerdad! \n\nEntering and display\n\nThe interrobang is not a standard punctuation mark. Few modern typefaces or fonts include a glyph for the interrobang character. The standard interrobang is at Unicode code point .  The inverted interrobang is at Unicode code point .  Single-character versions of the double-glyph versions are also available at code points  and .\n\nThe interrobang can be used in some word processors with the alt code  when working in a font that supports the interrobang, or using an operating system that performs font substitution.\n\nDepending on the browser and which fonts the user has installed, some of these may or may not be displayed or may be substituted with a different font.\n\nOn a Linux system supporting the Compose Key, an interrobang can be produced by pressing the compose key followed by the exclamation point and the question mark; reversing the order creates the inverted interrobang.  On Mac OS X, it is found on the Character Palette, obtained by pressing the key combination .\n\nThe interrobang can be displayed in LaTeX by using the package textcomp and the command \\textinterrobang. The inverted interrobang is also provided for in the textcomp package through the command \\textinterrobangdown.\n\nProminent uses\n\nThe State Library of New South Wales, New South Wales, Australia, uses an interrobang as its logo,  as does educational publishing company Pearson, who intend it to convey \"the excitement and fun of learning\". \n\nChief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook used an interrobang in the 2012 Seventh Circuit opinion Robert F. Booth Trust v. Crowley.\nQuestion:\nThe interrobang is a punctuation mark that consist of the superimposition of an exclamation mark and what other punctuation mark?\nAnswer:\nQuestion point\nPassage:\nSpraint\nSpraint is the dung of the otter. \n\nSpraints are typically identified by smell and are known for their distinct aromas, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish.  The European otter's spraints are black and slimy,  long and deposited in groups of up to four in prominent locations near water. They contain scales, shells and bones of water creatures.  Because of the decline of otters in Britain, several surveys have been made to record the distribution of the animal, usually by recording the presence of spraint.\n  Further, there is some evidence that spraint density is correlated with otter density.\nQuestion:\nFinding its spraint means what animal has been there?\nAnswer:\nLutrinae\nPassage:\nDonnie Wahlberg\nDonald Edmond \"Donnie\" Wahlberg, Jr.  (born August 17, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter, actor, record producer, and film producer.

I understand that in this case, Tuesday becomes the public holiday.  In my business, the staff work on all three of these days.  Do I have to pay them time and a half for the Sunday, or the Monday and Tuesday, or all three?\nFirst, determine which of the days would be a normal working day for the employee if it were not Christmas. Once determined, the following applies\nIf the same staff member usually works all three days, Sunday are Monday are the public holidays. For working those two days you pay time and a half, plus allow the two alternative holidays. For them, Tuesday is not a public holiday.\nIf a staff member works just the Sunday and Monday, or just the Monday and Tuesday, then in both these cases, both days are public holidays. Pay time and a half and allow a day in lieu for each day worked.\nIf an employee usually works just the Sunday and Tuesday, then only the Sunday is a public holiday. The Tuesday is not a public holiday for this employee, because the Tuesday only becomes a public holiday if the employee does not usually work on the Sunday.\nIf an employee would only usually work one of the days between Sunday and Tuesday, then irrespective of which day it is, it is to be treated as a public holiday.\nThis is covered by Section 45 which has changed the handling of the four public holidays at Christmas and New Year.\nSection 45\nTransfer of public holidays over Christmas and New Year\n(1)  For the purposes of this subpart, if any of the public holidays listed in section 44(1)(a) to (d) (christmas and new year)\n(a)  falls on a Saturday and the day would otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on that day:\n(b)  falls on a Saturday and the day would not otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Monday:\n(c)  falls on a Sunday and the day would otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on that day:\n(d)  falls on a Sunday and the day would not otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Tuesday.\n(2)  To avoid doubt, this section does not entitle an employee to more than 4 public holidays for the days listed in section 44(1)(a) to (d) (christmas and new year).\nWhat this section effectively says is\nIf the Christmas or New Year holidays fall on a Saturday or Sunday, and the employee normally works on a Saturday or Sunday, then the Saturday or Sunday are public holidays.\nIf an employee does not usually work on the Saturday or Sunday, then the public holidays are the following Monday or Tuesday.\nMy employee works Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  We are closing on Sunday - Christmas Day but will be working every other day. What does the employee get?\nYour employee normally works Sunday, but not Monday or Tuesday.\nTherefore the Monday and Tuesday days are irrelevant.\nThey are not working on Sunday because you are closed. Therefore the employee takes that day as a public holiday, and gets paid what they would normally earn on that day.\nPublic Holidays In Ace Payroll\nTo pay an employee for a public holiday, from the Pay Calculation screen click Leave , then select either Public Holiday Taken or Public Holiday Worked.\nFor every employee, there are only three possibilities\nPublic Holiday Taken\nSelect this option if the employee did not work on the public holiday, but would have worked had the day not been a public holiday.\nFor detailed documentation, see the Public Holiday Taken FAQ.\nPublic Holiday Worked\nFor detailed documentation, see the Public Holiday Worked FAQ.\nNot Entitled To Public Holiday\nIf the public holiday falls on a day that would not otherwise have been a working day for the employee, do nothing.\nThe employee is not entitled to any sort of payment in these circumstances.\nQuestion:\nIf Christmas Day falls on a Tuesday, on what day will New Year's Day fall?\nAnswer:\nDay of T\u012bwaz\n", "answers": ["Childe Harold's"], "pred": "Lizzie Eustace.\nLizzie Eustace.\nLizzie Eustace.\nLizzie Eustace.\nLizzie Eustace.\nLizzie", "length": 12408, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d1c7310c2d98d1f1851de8cbdc17064a3a09329496c39233"}
