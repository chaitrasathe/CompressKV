{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\nMarketing: Oh , okay ,\nUser Interface: No , I don't think so .\nMarketing: I think it's a technical thing\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: which our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and those waves have high {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nUser Interface: Twenty five . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: but we have to take this into account .\nUser Interface: Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: So anyway\nUser Interface: One of us {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\nUser Interface: Functions .\nMarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\nProject Manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\nMarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay .\nMarketing: this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .\nUser Interface: I got one question ,\nMarketing: I can go back .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nMarketing: Yeah one question ,\nUser Interface: uh you are a Market Expert\nMarketing: yeah ?\nUser Interface: so\nMarketing: I am . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: should we aim at the young people or not ?\nMarketing: I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , then teletext is used less .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: That's good point .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yep .\nUser Interface: Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: 'Kay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Of the technical function , so {vocalsound} uh\nMarketing: So I think it's you , huh ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's\nMarketing: No ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} That's me .\nProject Manager: what effect {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: techni function of {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , user requiremen\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . Wait a second .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Argh .\nIndustrial Designer: I have to do working design so uh\nProject Manager: So you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's {disfmarker} but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\nProject Manager: Okay . Let's go .\nUser Interface: So next slide please . And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\nMarketing: Makes sense . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: which one would you prefer ? I guess this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\nUser Interface: Sure , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like , between those two\nUser Interface: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple\nIndustrial Designer: li\nProject Manager: Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: simple desires into simple actions .\nMarketing: Nice . Nice sentence .\nUser Interface: Findings .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh sorry .\nUser Interface: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a really good style , it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So {disfmarker} Press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: It's off .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: It's on .\nUser Interface: the T_V_ turns on .\nMarketing: And when does it turn off ?\nUser Interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the {disfmarker} For for enough time\nMarketing: Oh so you have a\nUser Interface: like uh you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: sensing {disfmarker} sensor machine that uh knows {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's a question to our technical design , our {vocalsound} two engineers .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\nProject Manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's easy to do ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: you just control the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: According to your distance to {disfmarker} and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\nIndustrial Designer: Distance .\nUser Interface: According to the distance . {gap} Yeah yeah yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\nUser Interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . {gap}\nUser Interface: So , its main purpose in fact is a back light ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: which change colours ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: which makes it easier to find , and each can {disfmarker} it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: So basically that's it .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\nUser Interface: Can be easily done ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Just few actions , a few actions for everything .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . S\nUser Interface: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\nProject Manager: Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah and it {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: Okay , but it's quite universal you know .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: We can just extend it to any device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So for instance if I want to go to {disfmarker} directly to channel twenty five , how would I do {disfmarker} can I do that with this ?\nUser Interface: Uh twenty five .\nMarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact I would propose another solution .\nMarketing: Or is it ?\nUser Interface: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ?\nMarketing: Most people {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\nMarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: B yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number\nMarketing: Go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: and then it go\nMarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\nIndustrial Designer: t because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But still {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .\nProject Manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And it's only next .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah\nUser Interface: Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\nMarketing: so {disfmarker} but you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah. .\nUser Interface: Or say this can be back .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press {disfmarker} suppose two five they just press two and five\nMarketing: So it would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and you can change mode {disfmarker} zapping mode or\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Alright .\nProject Manager: uh current chan\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Listening more .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\nMarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Although I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright ? Thanks for your attention .\nProject Manager: Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry .\nProject Manager: You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .\nProject Manager: Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nProject Manager: On {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so that we just use simple recog\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Too complex .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: no but but {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\nMarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And what about the price of this component ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\nProject Manager: It mm {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: Hmm . Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,\nMarketing: Millions . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so we can make really simp\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we want to make really simple device\nMarketing: Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .\nMarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\nIndustrial Designer: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm .\nIndustrial Designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nMarketing: Couple of words .\nIndustrial Designer: then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nMarketing: Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\nProject Manager: No , in no not only speech , yeah .\nMarketing: It's on top of using the button .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I it's an option .\nUser Interface: Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .\nMarketing: Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key .\nUser Interface: Okay. .\nIndustrial Designer: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nMarketing: T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sho to to train , okay .\nUser Interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: roll 'em up\nIndustrial Designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nUser Interface: or roll 'em down .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer: because it's it's very expensive\nMarketing: no ?\nIndustrial Designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nProject Manager: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm why ?\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: And volume control .\nIndustrial Designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nMarketing: So but uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Wouldn't that make uh {vocalsound} arguments ?\nIndustrial Designer: They can make {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about the working design of the remote control.\nAnswer:", "input": "Summarize the discussion about the working design of the remote control.", "context": "Project Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\nMarketing: Oh , okay ,\nUser Interface: No , I don't think so .\nMarketing: I think it's a technical thing\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: which our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and those waves have high {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nUser Interface: Twenty five . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: but we have to take this into account .\nUser Interface: Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: So anyway\nUser Interface: One of us {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\nUser Interface: Functions .\nMarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\nProject Manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\nMarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay .\nMarketing: this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .\nUser Interface: I got one question ,\nMarketing: I can go back .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nMarketing: Yeah one question ,\nUser Interface: uh you are a Market Expert\nMarketing: yeah ?\nUser Interface: so\nMarketing: I am . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: should we aim at the young people or not ?\nMarketing: I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , then teletext is used less .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: That's good point .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yep .\nUser Interface: Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: 'Kay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Of the technical function , so {vocalsound} uh\nMarketing: So I think it's you , huh ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's\nMarketing: No ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} That's me .\nProject Manager: what effect {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: techni function of {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , user requiremen\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . Wait a second .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Argh .\nIndustrial Designer: I have to do working design so uh\nProject Manager: So you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's {disfmarker} but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\nProject Manager: Okay . Let's go .\nUser Interface: So next slide please . And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\nMarketing: Makes sense . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: which one would you prefer ? I guess this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\nUser Interface: Sure , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like , between those two\nUser Interface: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple\nIndustrial Designer: li\nProject Manager: Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: simple desires into simple actions .\nMarketing: Nice . Nice sentence .\nUser Interface: Findings .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh sorry .\nUser Interface: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a really good style , it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So {disfmarker} Press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: It's off .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: It's on .\nUser Interface: the T_V_ turns on .\nMarketing: And when does it turn off ?\nUser Interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the {disfmarker} For for enough time\nMarketing: Oh so you have a\nUser Interface: like uh you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: sensing {disfmarker} sensor machine that uh knows {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's a question to our technical design , our {vocalsound} two engineers .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\nProject Manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's easy to do ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: you just control the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: According to your distance to {disfmarker} and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\nIndustrial Designer: Distance .\nUser Interface: According to the distance . {gap} Yeah yeah yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\nUser Interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . {gap}\nUser Interface: So , its main purpose in fact is a back light ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: which change colours ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: which makes it easier to find , and each can {disfmarker} it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: So basically that's it .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\nUser Interface: Can be easily done ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Just few actions , a few actions for everything .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . S\nUser Interface: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\nProject Manager: Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah and it {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: Okay , but it's quite universal you know .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: We can just extend it to any device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So for instance if I want to go to {disfmarker} directly to channel twenty five , how would I do {disfmarker} can I do that with this ?\nUser Interface: Uh twenty five .\nMarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact I would propose another solution .\nMarketing: Or is it ?\nUser Interface: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ?\nMarketing: Most people {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\nMarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: B yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number\nMarketing: Go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: and then it go\nMarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\nIndustrial Designer: t because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But still {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .\nProject Manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And it's only next .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah\nUser Interface: Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\nMarketing: so {disfmarker} but you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah. .\nUser Interface: Or say this can be back .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press {disfmarker} suppose two five they just press two and five\nMarketing: So it would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and you can change mode {disfmarker} zapping mode or\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Alright .\nProject Manager: uh current chan\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Listening more .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\nMarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Although I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright ? Thanks for your attention .\nProject Manager: Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry .\nProject Manager: You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .\nProject Manager: Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nProject Manager: On {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so that we just use simple recog\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Too complex .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: no but but {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\nMarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And what about the price of this component ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\nProject Manager: It mm {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: Hmm . Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,\nMarketing: Millions . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so we can make really simp\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we want to make really simple device\nMarketing: Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .\nMarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\nIndustrial Designer: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm .\nIndustrial Designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nMarketing: Couple of words .\nIndustrial Designer: then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nMarketing: Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\nProject Manager: No , in no not only speech , yeah .\nMarketing: It's on top of using the button .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I it's an option .\nUser Interface: Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .\nMarketing: Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key .\nUser Interface: Okay. .\nIndustrial Designer: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nMarketing: T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sho to to train , okay .\nUser Interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: roll 'em up\nIndustrial Designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nUser Interface: or roll 'em down .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer: because it's it's very expensive\nMarketing: no ?\nIndustrial Designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nProject Manager: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm why ?\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: And volume control .\nIndustrial Designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nMarketing: So but uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Wouldn't that make uh {vocalsound} arguments ?\nIndustrial Designer: They can make {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}", "answers": ["The industrial designer described the product as a portable device with some energy source, an interface which included some pressing buttons and keys, a processor, some infrared source which could send the information to the main device, and different encryption codes for different TVs. Since the Marketing and the user interface designer mentioned speech recognition, the industrial designer also took that into account. All these components would cost 5 Euros or even less than that. As for gesture recognition and automatic power control, the group gave them up due to price issues. At the end of the meeting, the group also talked about how to enable the users to find the controller."], "pred": " Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum. Sum.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager: That's great .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: Perfect .\nProject Manager: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is {disfmarker} I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about {disfmarker} I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some {disfmarker} you know , say our {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind {disfmarker} before we launch {disfmarker} can we see how they're received ?\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker} It's an option , uh but actually there's {disfmarker} I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now\nProject Manager: Okay . Okay .\nMarketing: which actually might even come into play beforehand ,\nProject Manager: Okay , perfect .\nMarketing: it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .\nProject Manager: Great , thank you very much Nathan .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , you're welcome .\nProject Manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You waiting for me ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Fascinating , compelling even .\nMarketing: I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . {vocalsound} Right . So\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now {disfmarker} basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting {disfmarker} they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um {disfmarker} that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tomatoes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: a different shape\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or {vocalsound} okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of {disfmarker} and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I like it , I like it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: uh not something I I've come up with a {gap} though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use {disfmarker} we can use a rubber as part of the case ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Slick , slick .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nMarketing: Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new {disfmarker} I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager: Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's {disfmarker} tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause so many {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nIndustrial Designer: you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .\nMarketing: Very true . Very true .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's like , yep {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you ,\nMarketing: Very much so {vocalsound} . Um\nIndustrial Designer: you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .\nProject Manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it ?\nUser Interface: We can have a duck tape casing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We could .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It could go with the granola crowd .\nMarketing: but worth a shot .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , it could be , it could be ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Great ,\nMarketing: um . Yeah that's what I know .\nProject Manager: thanks for that Sarah .\nMarketing: No problem .\nProject Manager: Ron ?\nUser Interface: Phew . Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look .\nProject Manager: Yeah\nUser Interface: Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um {disfmarker} with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} On the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: at the {gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: right .\nMarketing: Yeah . Very true , very true .\nUser Interface: Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: which I am sure most of you know about .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern {gap} a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your {disfmarker} for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I {disfmarker} again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I can see . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , again probably not what we're going for\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so I {disfmarker} I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh {disfmarker} our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it\nMarketing: Mm , right .\nUser Interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: has jokes when it's ready .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager: Great .\nUser Interface: And uh that is about it .\nProject Manager: Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . {vocalsound} Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um {vocalsound} various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?\nMarketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . 'Kay .\nMarketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: right ?\nIndustrial Designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote ,\nProject Manager: To produce each one .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Per ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's just an estimate though .\nMarketing: Piece .\nUser Interface: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: You industrial designers . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I know .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's fun . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?\nProject Manager: Well .\nMarketing: Do we remember ?\nIndustrial Designer: I thought there was some flexibility with that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: There is , it's just , it is a question of {disfmarker} and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .\nMarketing: Can we justify it ?\nProject Manager: Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin {vocalsound} um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?\nIndustrial Designer: That's just off the top of my head ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} From the board ,\nIndustrial Designer: it is pending further emails . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: um , well {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's true , I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It is the new {disfmarker} it would be in a class of its own .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And that's {disfmarker} to be fair the um the per cent of the market {disfmarker} we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make {disfmarker} I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros ,\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh {disfmarker} on the third floor suggested that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: See if we can cut some corners .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's true .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right . It's a starting point anyway , so .\nProject Manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we {disfmarker} yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} our main selling point here .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition {disfmarker} I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} The voice rec thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , {vocalsound} if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec .\nMarketing: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house ,\nMarketing: Price-wise .\nUser Interface: I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: we're using it for our coffee machines already .\nMarketing: We've already got it .\nUser Interface: I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh {disfmarker} guy down the hall . Sounds good .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?\nIndustrial Designer: I think if we {disfmarker} we do both the {disfmarker} obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into {disfmarker} it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice .\nMarketing: Pretty much .\nUser Interface: I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .\nMarketing: Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Does having both really up our costs ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , 'cause you {disfmarker} you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .\nProject Manager: It's just impossible .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just {disfmarker} it just becomes cost prohibitive . What {disfmarker} which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?\nMarketing: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .\nIndustrial Designer: I would have to side with that ,\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the {disfmarker} all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well my p {vocalsound} is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nathan ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would {disfmarker} they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: we're not gonna have to do as much design work\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .\nProject Manager: Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment .\nMarketing: And we're still not {disfmarker} then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: we can stick with what we've already got . In a lot other ways too .\nProject Manager: Okay . So I'm getting {disfmarker} alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay .\nMarketing: I think it's our lower risk option\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: which for right now {disfmarker} we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .\nProject Manager: Okay . Sorted .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .\nUser Interface: It's you and me outside a little here . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's {disfmarker} you guys's next step right ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it {disfmarker} what {vocalsound} f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ?\nProject Manager: Yes . We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement ,\nProject Manager: Mm . Yep .\nMarketing: like what if {disfmarker} wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light ,\nUser Interface: Calculator .\nMarketing: Yeah . True . True .\nIndustrial Designer: um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: What do you think Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?\nUser Interface: Just a thought .\nIndustrial Designer: What's the uh idea ?\nUser Interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .\nMarketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Do you think people that are {disfmarker} people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .\nMarketing: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,\nProject Manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well .\nMarketing: right .\nProject Manager: But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have {disfmarker} or like um {vocalsound} who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well .\nMarketing: With the bu yeah .\nProject Manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , I think you're on to something\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is {disfmarker} would be good , even though {disfmarker} and hand-held the same time .\nMarketing: True . Way to go .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things .\nMarketing: Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: you know like that little pod looking thing ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , those are nice .\nUser Interface: Exactly .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I mean a nice {disfmarker} although we do um wh uh is {disfmarker} I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: and get back to it\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh {disfmarker} using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: um you know\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit {disfmarker} gives just a bit . You know\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Just kind of the squishy feel .\nMarketing: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it {disfmarker} literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good .\nMarketing: Handy .\nProject Manager: Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , {vocalsound} um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We'll have more of an idea when the prototype {disfmarker} have more of a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and I'm just having to guess .\nProject Manager: we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . {vocalsound} Um , so\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we {disfmarker} wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um {vocalsound} a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .\nMarketing: Mm . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Like maybe have menu things .\nMarketing: Take precedence ,\nIndustrial Designer: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out\nMarketing: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .\nMarketing: And they slide .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah\nMarketing: True ,\nProject Manager: we've also got the the me the thing of ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: we're still not making it easier then .\nProject Manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: B But no I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group talk about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the group talk about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget?", "context": "Marketing: {vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager: That's great .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: Perfect .\nProject Manager: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is {disfmarker} I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about {disfmarker} I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some {disfmarker} you know , say our {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind {disfmarker} before we launch {disfmarker} can we see how they're received ?\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker} It's an option , uh but actually there's {disfmarker} I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now\nProject Manager: Okay . Okay .\nMarketing: which actually might even come into play beforehand ,\nProject Manager: Okay , perfect .\nMarketing: it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .\nProject Manager: Great , thank you very much Nathan .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , you're welcome .\nProject Manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You waiting for me ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Fascinating , compelling even .\nMarketing: I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . {vocalsound} Right . So\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now {disfmarker} basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting {disfmarker} they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um {disfmarker} that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tomatoes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: a different shape\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or {vocalsound} okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of {disfmarker} and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I like it , I like it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: uh not something I I've come up with a {gap} though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use {disfmarker} we can use a rubber as part of the case ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Slick , slick .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nMarketing: Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new {disfmarker} I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager: Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's {disfmarker} tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause so many {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nIndustrial Designer: you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .\nMarketing: Very true . Very true .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's like , yep {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you ,\nMarketing: Very much so {vocalsound} . Um\nIndustrial Designer: you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .\nProject Manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it ?\nUser Interface: We can have a duck tape casing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We could .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It could go with the granola crowd .\nMarketing: but worth a shot .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , it could be , it could be ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Great ,\nMarketing: um . Yeah that's what I know .\nProject Manager: thanks for that Sarah .\nMarketing: No problem .\nProject Manager: Ron ?\nUser Interface: Phew . Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look .\nProject Manager: Yeah\nUser Interface: Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um {disfmarker} with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} On the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: at the {gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: right .\nMarketing: Yeah . Very true , very true .\nUser Interface: Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: which I am sure most of you know about .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern {gap} a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your {disfmarker} for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I {disfmarker} again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I can see . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , again probably not what we're going for\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so I {disfmarker} I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh {disfmarker} our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it\nMarketing: Mm , right .\nUser Interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: has jokes when it's ready .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager: Great .\nUser Interface: And uh that is about it .\nProject Manager: Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . {vocalsound} Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um {vocalsound} various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?\nMarketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . 'Kay .\nMarketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: right ?\nIndustrial Designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote ,\nProject Manager: To produce each one .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Per ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's just an estimate though .\nMarketing: Piece .\nUser Interface: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: You industrial designers . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I know .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's fun . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?\nProject Manager: Well .\nMarketing: Do we remember ?\nIndustrial Designer: I thought there was some flexibility with that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: There is , it's just , it is a question of {disfmarker} and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .\nMarketing: Can we justify it ?\nProject Manager: Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin {vocalsound} um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?\nIndustrial Designer: That's just off the top of my head ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} From the board ,\nIndustrial Designer: it is pending further emails . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: um , well {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's true , I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It is the new {disfmarker} it would be in a class of its own .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And that's {disfmarker} to be fair the um the per cent of the market {disfmarker} we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make {disfmarker} I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros ,\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh {disfmarker} on the third floor suggested that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: See if we can cut some corners .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's true .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right . It's a starting point anyway , so .\nProject Manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we {disfmarker} yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} our main selling point here .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition {disfmarker} I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} The voice rec thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , {vocalsound} if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec .\nMarketing: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house ,\nMarketing: Price-wise .\nUser Interface: I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: we're using it for our coffee machines already .\nMarketing: We've already got it .\nUser Interface: I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh {disfmarker} guy down the hall . Sounds good .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?\nIndustrial Designer: I think if we {disfmarker} we do both the {disfmarker} obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into {disfmarker} it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice .\nMarketing: Pretty much .\nUser Interface: I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .\nMarketing: Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Does having both really up our costs ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , 'cause you {disfmarker} you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .\nProject Manager: It's just impossible .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just {disfmarker} it just becomes cost prohibitive . What {disfmarker} which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?\nMarketing: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .\nIndustrial Designer: I would have to side with that ,\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the {disfmarker} all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well my p {vocalsound} is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nathan ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would {disfmarker} they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: we're not gonna have to do as much design work\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .\nProject Manager: Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment .\nMarketing: And we're still not {disfmarker} then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: we can stick with what we've already got . In a lot other ways too .\nProject Manager: Okay . So I'm getting {disfmarker} alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay .\nMarketing: I think it's our lower risk option\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: which for right now {disfmarker} we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .\nProject Manager: Okay . Sorted .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .\nUser Interface: It's you and me outside a little here . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's {disfmarker} you guys's next step right ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it {disfmarker} what {vocalsound} f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ?\nProject Manager: Yes . We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement ,\nProject Manager: Mm . Yep .\nMarketing: like what if {disfmarker} wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light ,\nUser Interface: Calculator .\nMarketing: Yeah . True . True .\nIndustrial Designer: um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: What do you think Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?\nUser Interface: Just a thought .\nIndustrial Designer: What's the uh idea ?\nUser Interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .\nMarketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Do you think people that are {disfmarker} people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .\nMarketing: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,\nProject Manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well .\nMarketing: right .\nProject Manager: But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have {disfmarker} or like um {vocalsound} who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well .\nMarketing: With the bu yeah .\nProject Manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , I think you're on to something\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is {disfmarker} would be good , even though {disfmarker} and hand-held the same time .\nMarketing: True . Way to go .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things .\nMarketing: Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: you know like that little pod looking thing ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , those are nice .\nUser Interface: Exactly .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I mean a nice {disfmarker} although we do um wh uh is {disfmarker} I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: and get back to it\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh {disfmarker} using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: um you know\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit {disfmarker} gives just a bit . You know\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Just kind of the squishy feel .\nMarketing: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it {disfmarker} literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good .\nMarketing: Handy .\nProject Manager: Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , {vocalsound} um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We'll have more of an idea when the prototype {disfmarker} have more of a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and I'm just having to guess .\nProject Manager: we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . {vocalsound} Um , so\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we {disfmarker} wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um {vocalsound} a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .\nMarketing: Mm . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Like maybe have menu things .\nMarketing: Take precedence ,\nIndustrial Designer: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out\nMarketing: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .\nMarketing: And they slide .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah\nMarketing: True ,\nProject Manager: we've also got the the me the thing of ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: we're still not making it easier then .\nProject Manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: B But no I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .", "answers": ["The group found that if they would use the touch screen as well as the voice recognition technique, the cost would up to 17 euros.

Yes . OK .\nGrad E: OK , so for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} For people wearing the wireless mikes , like {disfmarker} like this one , I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this {disfmarker} this sorta like that .\nPhD H: This is {disfmarker} chan channel channel one one two three\nGrad F: Channel five , channel five .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Mm - hmm . What do you do ,\nGrad E: It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples ,\nGrad F: Test , test test .\nProfessor B: you do it higher ?\nGrad E: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , I think we 're supposed to {disfmarker} that 's right .\nGrad E: And then also , for {disfmarker} for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth ,\nGrad F: Test test .\nPhD A: By the way , there was a bug . Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper\nPhD D: Oh it was .\nGrad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth ,\nPhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: so about like I 'm wearing it now .\nPhD D: Oh that 's interesting . So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nGrad E: so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth ,\nPhD H: It 's not always possible .\nPhD A: Hmm ?\nPhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nPostdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: Is that @ @ ? OK , thank you .\nGrad F: Adam , I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD D: O Oh oh I see .\nGrad F: uh , looks kinda low on channel five {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I see , I see .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad F: no ?\nGrad E: Channel five , s speak again .\nGrad F: Maybe not .\nPostdoc G: Hello .\nPhD A: Basically there were no counts\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's alright .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad E: I mean , we could {disfmarker} we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to .\nGrad F: It 's OK ?\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad F: Is this OK ?\nPhD H: OK .\nPhD D: I see what you mean .\nPhD C: Who 's channel B ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker} Uh , channel B is probably Liz .\nPhD C: Uh oh .\nPhD H: Uh channel B {disfmarker} I am channel B .\nProfessor B: You wanna close this ,\nPostdoc G: Channel eight , eight .\nProfessor B: or\nPhD C: No I\nGrad E: Thank you .\nPhD H: No , channel B .\nPhD A: Hello , hello .\nPhD C: yeah , yeah , you 're channel B .\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah .\nPhD C: So can you talk a bit ? I thought it might be too\nPhD H: OK , yeah , channel B , one two three four five .\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's alright . So , the gain isn't real good .\nProfessor B: We 're recording ,\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor B: right ?\nGrad E: OK , so we are recording .\nPhD H: Ah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: Um we {disfmarker} we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it . And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .\nPhD H: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: We {disfmarker} we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank . Um I {disfmarker} I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: so\nPhD D: California .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: California .\nPhD H: California .\nPhD A: Um may I make one suggestion ? Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth\nGrad E: Sure .\nPhD A: because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .\nGrad E: Oh .\nPhD C: A actually , wait a minute ,\nGrad E: Birth year ?\nPostdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around ?\nPhD D: Not for me .\nPostdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the other side ,\nPhD A: Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: O yeah .\nPhD D: But there 's no other date on the form .\nPhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nPostdoc G: Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .\nGrad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .\nPhD A: Anyway .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , that 's true .\nPhD C: I still don't see the problem .\nGrad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is alright\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: so , anyway . And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time , the speaker form only once , the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting . OK ? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form . And that should just be one person whose name I don't know . OK ?\nGrad F: Do you want this {pause} Adam ?\nGrad E: Uh sure . Thank you .\nProfessor B: So uh\nGrad E: OK so should we do agenda items ?\nProfessor B: Uh oh that 's a good idea . I shouldn't run the meeting .\nGrad E: Uh well I have {disfmarker} I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results . Anything else ?\nPhD C: I guess {disfmarker} what time do we have to leave ? Three thirty ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nGrad E: Why don't you go first then .\nPhD C: so .\nProfessor B: Yeah , good idea .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Um Well , I {disfmarker} I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams {disfmarker} a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who {disfmarker} Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um {vocalsound} you know separated {disfmarker} used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so {disfmarker} so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that {disfmarker} that 's twenty minutes or so ? Um yeah because I guess there 's some ,\nGrad E: Or so .\nPhD C: and Don can talk to Jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm {disfmarker} we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} was that {disfmarker} did that {disfmarker} did that recording have the glitch in the middle ?\nPostdoc G: I 'm puzzled by that . I {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} oh , I see .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Oh there was a glitch somewhere .\nPhD C: yeah , so that actually um\nGrad F: Was it twenty minutes in ,\nPhD C: if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know\nPostdoc G: I forgot about that .\nGrad F: I thought {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well it was interesting ,\nPostdoc G: Well , I mean , they {disfmarker}\nPhD A: suddenly {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent\nGrad E: I don't remember when it is .\nPostdoc G: but I was able to can transcribe\nPhD A: but i looking at {disfmarker} the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the {disfmarker} it was actually recognized\nPhD C: Wel\nGrad E: Oh no .\nGrad F: Yeah , that might be {disfmarker} that might be {disfmarker} that might be my fault .\nPostdoc G: Wow .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .\nGrad F: I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: No actually it was {disfmarker} yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um\nGrad F: yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time ,\nPostdoc G: Oh . That 's not good .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: so that 's what we have\nGrad E: Alright .\nGrad F: so\nPhD C: but that {disfmarker} that will be completely gone if this synch time problem\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: The {disfmarker} the glitch\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to\nPostdoc G: And the only glitch {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: yeah .\nPhD C: So you guys know .\nProfessor B: S sorry I haven't seen the email ,\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Th - the\nPostdoc G: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} wait\nProfessor B: what was the score ?\nPhD C: So here 's the actual copy of the email\nPostdoc G: we should say something about the glitch . He {disfmarker} he can say something about the glitch .\nPhD C: um oh OK\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Cuz it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} h it 's {disfmarker} it 's very small {disfmarker}\nPhD C: so does this glitch occur at other {disfmarker}\nGrad E: There {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized\nPostdoc G: very small . Yep .\nPhD C: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad E: so the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad E: and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing {disfmarker} doing click sounds .\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And is it only once that that happens ?\nGrad E: But yeah\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: it {disfmarker} right once in the middle .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong\nProfessor B: so {disfmarker} so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice ,\nPhD C: but\nGrad E: Um But that shouldn't affect anything\nPhD C: OK so that 's actually\nPostdoc G: S and it {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: you see this here ?\nPhD C: It {disfmarker} y it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah yeah \" bah \"\nPhD C: OK no {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: What happens is it actually affects the script that Don {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Huh .\nPhD C: I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it\nGrad E: Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything .\nPhD C: but they\nGrad F: Yeah , I don't know exactly what affected it\nPostdoc G: I agree . I agree .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I have {disfmarker}\nGrad F: but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you about it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: But I {disfmarker} I do remember {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: I 'll show you the point .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . It {disfmarker} it had no effect on my transcription ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: you know , I mean I {disfmarker} I had no trouble hearing it and {disfmarker} and having time bins\nGrad E: I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .\nPostdoc G: but there was a {disfmarker} Oh .\nPhD C: Well , the {disfmarker} the synch time {disfmarker} the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should ,\nGrad F: That 's what happened .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad E: Where {disfmarker} where they weren't monotonic .\nGrad F: There was {disfmarker} yeah , I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: right ? There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh , interesting .\nPhD C: And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right\nGrad E: Oh OK so that 's\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: so anyway it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah sounds like a bug .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Non - zero ? Um there are like more {disfmarker} cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran ,\nGrad E: The other one I saw was that it yeah .\nGrad F: I mean but there were there was a point .\nPhD C: Yeah that was fine . That {disfmarker} that was OK .\nGrad E: The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: and that definitely indicra indicates a bug .\nGrad F: Uh .\nPhD C: Well that would really be a problem , yeah . So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: um and what 's {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So that 's very encouraging .\nPhD C: this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Cool .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which\nPhD D: Trent Lott .\nPhD C: um I mean these are sort of funny ones ,\nPhD D: It 'll get those though .\nPhD C: there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see\nGrad E: I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: but um it 's pretty good .\nGrad E: because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ?\nPhD C: Well so I guess we can generate\nGrad E: Sounds likes ?\nPhD A: There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where {disfmarker} got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Yeah , and who cares ? And {disfmarker} and there were lots of {disfmarker} of course the \" uh uh \" - s , \" in on \" - s \" of uh \" - s .\nPhD A: Mmm , so if {disfmarker}\nPhD C: there 's {disfmarker} No those are actually\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or\nGrad E: Right . Ri - ri right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Did you say there 's no language for PZM ?\nPhD C: No language model , I mean those {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean {disfmarker} so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings .\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet .\nProfessor B: Well , we don't even know what that means ,\nPhD C: so {vocalsound} but this is really encouraging because\nProfessor B: so I\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right .\nPhD C: so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of {disfmarker} of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained {disfmarker} mostly trained recognizer\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and Switchboard - two is {disfmarker} got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic\nGrad E: Excellent .\nPhD C: and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did {disfmarker} had the ninety - three workshop\nPhD C: Um\nProfessor B: and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Oh yeah\nProfessor B: you know\nPhD C: I mean this is really ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: Well especially for the very first run , I mean you {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh it 's the {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: eh um\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: yeah\nGrad E: the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but\nPhD C: So and what al also this means is that\nPostdoc G: Right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Not Switchboard ,\nPhD A: Well it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people\nGrad E: uh Broadcast News .\nPhD C: especially I guess um with Jane that {disfmarker} that would help for {disfmarker} since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring . I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so you know the language model was straight from {disfmarker} from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or {disfmarker} or\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nGrad E: Yeah , so that 's great .\nPhD C: No .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: And actually {disfmarker} we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nPhD A: Well that 's {disfmarker} those are the only we ones there are ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: which I guess\nPhD D: I was just gonna say ,\nPhD C: so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of\nPhD D: yeah .\nPhD A: I mean\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: and I guess Ramana , so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: it 's {disfmarker} it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech .\nPhD D: It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech\nPhD C: So .\nPhD A: Oh yeah .\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah ,\nPhD C: Right , so it 's {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: but for Broadcast News when we {disfmarker} we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss .\nGrad E: Right , it was not a big deal .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: I should {disfmarker} I should say that {disfmarker} the language model is not just Switchboard\nPhD C: so I wou so that 's good .\nGrad E: Although combining em worked well .\nPhD A: it 's also {disfmarker} I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: uh because\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Like Trent Lott must have been from\nPhD A: mm - hmm , right .\nPhD C: I guess {vocalsound} Switchboard was before\nPhD A: Um By the way just {disfmarker} for fun we also ran ,\nPhD C: uh .\nProfessor B: Good point .\nPhD A: I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: so just for the heck of it I ran that\nGrad E: And it said a hundred percent male ?\nPhD A: um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .\nPhD C: The j\nPhD A: Yeah so\nGrad E: Oh it did ?\nPostdoc G: Oh that 's {disfmarker} I 'm glad .\nGrad E: It got all two genders ?\nPhD C: Yeah but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance\nPhD A: Yeah . Yes .\nPhD C: and uh and that 's interesting cuz I think the {disfmarker} their language models are quite different so and I {disfmarker} I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Right .\nPostdoc G: That makes a lot of sense ,\nPhD C: So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when {disfmarker} when we get new microphones\nPostdoc G: yeah . Very possible .\nProfessor B: Yeah I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would bet on that too\nPhD C: that would be worth it\nProfessor B: cuz he certainly in that {disfmarker} when as a {disfmarker} as a burp user he was {disfmarker} he was a pretty uh strong one .\nPhD C: um Yeah\nGrad E: Sheep .\nPhD C: he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he sounded to me just from {disfmarker} he sounded like a ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: what 's it a sheep or a goat ?\nProfessor B: Sheep .\nGrad E: A sheep .\nPhD C: Sheep ,\nGrad E: Baah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Sheep is good .\nPhD C: right . Sounded good .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right so um so I guess the good news is that\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker} and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no {disfmarker} no tailoring at all .\nPhD A: I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . The voca the vocabulary especially\nGrad E: Or just dictionary .\nPhD C: yeah .\nPhD A: Not that much the vocabulary actually\nPhD C: Yeah , so .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker} um well we have to see but {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . It 's pretty good um so then\nProfessor B: Have to add PZM and so on\nGrad E: And I have to try it on the far field mike\nProfessor B: but\nPhD C: PZM\nGrad E: yeah .\nPhD C: and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL . there 's things like that where , you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but in general it was really good and I 'm hoping {disfmarker} and this is {disfmarker} this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments , I mean it 's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information . For example about , you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times . Um so that 'll be something that actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place . Because it 's just gonna give us time marks\nPhD D: But you know {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Well we 've done that for one meeting .\nPhD C: so . For forced alignment .\nGrad E: Uh oh oh f not for words\nPhD C: Ye - right .\nGrad E: I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not {disfmarker} not for words .\nPhD C: Right . So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and then I was thinking it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription . Maybe actually mark the word boundaries .\nPhD C: Oh or {disfmarker} i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy .\nGrad E: Right , right .\nPhD C: It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around , if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good . So that 's about it .\nProfessor B: I r\nPhD D: I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though , I mean if we 're pr\nGrad E: That we 're starting so well ?\nPhD D: yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody 's gonna do well on\nProfessor B: Oh\nGrad E: Don't worry about it w d that 's that 's the close talking mikes . Try it on the P Z Ms and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor B: Yeah , which {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} well n n n n\nPhD D: So the real value of the database is these ?\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , abso well no but\nProfessor B: I mean there 's still just the w the percentages and , I mean they 're not {disfmarker} a as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps\nPhD C: This i yeah . This is not that good .\nProfessor B: there 's probably overlaps in {disfmarker} in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so but {disfmarker} but there 's other phenomena , it 's a meeting , it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes but uh yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could , I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor B: and uh see if it 's , you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it 's not maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something and {disfmarker} and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: No I think it 's really , I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the {disfmarker} the text um yeah they 're pretty good so and {disfmarker} and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard so that 's good . And um let 's see there was one more thing I wanted to {disfmarker} to mention {disfmarker} I can't remember um Sorry can't remember . anyway it 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Congratulations is really great .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's really good .\nPhD C: so Andreas set up this recognizer and {disfmarker} by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there so I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um so\nPhD A: We {disfmarker} we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . That 's {disfmarker} you know if {disfmarker} if there are more machines um uh here plus people can {disfmarker} could run their own uh you know variants of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the recognition {pause} runs um certainly doable . Um .\nProfessor B: Yeah and {disfmarker} well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Seems reasonable .\nPostdoc G: I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Which is um so this issue {vocalsound} of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted {disfmarker} Yeah , well , so what I mean is um the {disfmarker} uh the data that you take into SRI , first {disfmarker} first question , you 're maintaining it in {disfmarker} in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that {disfmarker} that kind of stuff , right ?\nPhD A: U um\nPhD C: From the outside world or\nPostdoc G: By uh people uh who are not associated with this project .\nPhD A: Oh .\nGrad E: It 's human subjects issues , I told you about that .\nPhD C: Um oh .\nPostdoc G: Exactly .\nPhD C: Well OK we have n no names . Although I sh um\nGrad E: That {disfmarker} that 's not the issue ,\nPhD C: de audio data itself ?\nGrad E: it 's just the audio data itself , until people have a chance to edit it .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm , exactly .\nPhD C: Uh so well I can {disfmarker} I can protect my directories through there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right now they 're not {disfmarker} they 're in the speech group directories which {disfmarker} so I will {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: I didn't know that actually .\nProfessor B: Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,\nPhD C: Yeah OK .\nProfessor B: say it 's OK .\nPhD C: Right OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , we had to get them to approve em and then i cuz {disfmarker} cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's but this {disfmarker} this meeting that you have , no problem cuz I {disfmarker} I well I mean I {disfmarker} I speak for myself\nGrad E: It 's us .\nPostdoc G: but {disfmarker} but I think that we didn't do anything that but well anyway so {vocalsound} uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects\nPhD C: That 's true .\nPostdoc G: and I don't know how that stands , I mean if you {disfmarker} if you get fantastic results and it 's involving {comment} data which {disfmarker} which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know but I wanted to raise that issue ,\nProfessor B: Well we ,\nPostdoc G: that 's all .\nProfessor B: I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it {disfmarker} hopefully it will be fairly quick but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on it 's just that we 're\nGrad E: Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: and get back any bleeps that they want\nPhD C: Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought .\nProfessor B: It 's gonna be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part .\nPhD A: U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling , um I don't know who , I mean how this was done but is {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} are there any um {vocalsound} issues with downsampling\nPhD C: Don did this .\nPhD A: because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly um so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand . And is there any um i are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ?\nGrad F: There are lots of w {vocalsound} there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on ,\nPhD A: OK . Right . OK .\nGrad F: like anti - aliasing stuff .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} th\nGrad E: I don't think we even know which one I assume you 're using syncat to do it ?\nGrad F: No , I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample .\nGrad E: Or sound resample ?\nPhD C: Re - re ref\nGrad E: Resample .\nPhD C: yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms .\nGrad F: RSMP . Yeah , I don't really .\nPhD C: Missing all the vowels .\nGrad F: I just {disfmarker} yeah I found it .\nPhD C: Some of the vowels ,\nGrad E: Not all of them .\nPhD C: almost all the vowels , that 's the hard part .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,\nGrad E: And a few of the consonants .\nPhD A: I mean segment them but not downsample them .\nPhD C: Yeah we could {disfmarker} we could try that and {disfmarker} and compare\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and feed them to {disfmarker} feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if {disfmarker} if the SRI front - end does something .\nGrad F: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I suspect that 's sort of premature optimization , but Sure .\nPhD C: We can try it . I {disfmarker} I only downsampled them first cuz I was\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I mean that 's just one line {disfmarker} that 's one line of code to comment at\nPhD C: yeah\nPhD A: Right and {disfmarker} and it doesn't {disfmarker} is no more work {vocalsound} for um you know for us .\nGrad F: so\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: Well they 're just bigger to transfer , that 's why I s downsampled them before but\nPhD A: Well but they 're only twice as big so\nPhD C: Well I mean that was {disfmarker} if it 's the same then we can downsample here\nPhD A: I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a\nPhD C: but if it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: so , but no , I mean it 's not {disfmarker} i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it {disfmarker}\nPhD C: We could try that .\nPhD A: Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know\nGrad F: it would {disfmarker}\nPhD A: minus the transfer time it would {disfmarker} it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's about a fifty minute drive , right ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why\nPhD C: Well it takes more disk space too so I was just {disfmarker}\nPhD A: and , you know , what {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad F: Mmm . In the front - end we could do that .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So you just train {disfmarker} just different filters\nGrad F: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is\nGrad F: Yeah , I can imagine it would be {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD C: So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences .\nGrad F: I mean I guess there 's some {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD A: So in other words right ,\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that . I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other I don't think that gives you any information .\nPhD C: Well it 's just as easy to {disfmarker} to give you the sixteen K individual ,\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: it was just more disk space you know for storing them\nProfessor B: Are you {disfmarker} are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ?\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: Mel cepstrum .\nProfessor B: So probably doesn't matter .\nPhD C: Well we could try .\nGrad F: There 's {disfmarker} there 's your answer .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but it wouldn't hurt to try ,\nPhD C: Could easily try\nPhD A: That 's what I would assume but you never know ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: you know .\nProfessor B: Sure . No the reason I say this\nPostdoc G: Just {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not {disfmarker} b you wouldn't expect to be so much but\nPhD C: Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti stick them somewhere\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really not a problem .\nPhD A: Actually , no .\nPhD C: and I 'll rerun it with\nPhD A: Don't stop . Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters ,\nGrad F: Keep going . Yeah .\nPhD A: so shouldn't use {disfmarker} you should s you know , get\nGrad F: Yeah , I mean I 'll {disfmarker} I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same ,\nPhD C: OK .\nPhD A:  Right .\nGrad F: it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right . Right .\nGrad F: and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory ,\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: I mean I corrected all {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: that 's not a problem .\nPhD C: I mean I hand - edited the whole {disfmarker} the whole meeting so that can be run it 's just {disfmarker} Once we get the {disfmarker} the bug out .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: One {disfmarker} one question which is I {disfmarker} I had the impression {comment} from this {disfmarker} from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc G: is that I thought that in order to\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: so it was {disfmarker} so it 's like there 's already down\nGrad E: There 's one level that 's already happening right here .\nProfessor B: This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs\nPostdoc G: OK .\nGrad E: Right .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: And it gets downsampled to sixteen .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: And that 's actually said in your meeting ,\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh OK .\nPhD C: that 's how I know that .\nPostdoc G: That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} It 's like are we downsampling to sixteen ?\nProfessor B: It 's a digital audio orientation for the board\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor B: it 's in the monitor so it 's\nPhD C: Thank God it 's not {vocalsound} more than that .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And I have no idea what filter it 's using ,\nGrad F: Is eight kilohertz {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ?\nGrad E: so\nProfessor B: For telephone stuff .\nGrad E: Telephone .\nPhD D: Telephone .\nGrad F: Yeah that 's what I was gonna say , I mean like {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database\nGrad F: so Oh , I see , so .\nProfessor B: and so that was a standard for that sixteen s\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing .\nProfessor B: Sixteen is more common for {disfmarker} for uh broadband stuff that isn't {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: That isn't music .\nProfessor B: that isn't music and isn't telephone ,\nPhD C: And I guess if you 're comparing like {disfmarker} uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: Why is that ?\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: right ? Well I don I mean if it 's any better\nProfessor B: No actually I would think that you would {disfmarker} you would get better {disfmarker} you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike .\nGrad E: All the way around I 'd think .\nProfessor B: Uh but who knows ? I mean we do {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna find all this stuff out ,\nPhD C: Yeah well we could try it .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: we don't know .\nGrad E: We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans .\nPhD C: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um well {disfmarker} well it 's sort of related but um good news also uh I got {disfmarker} well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on {disfmarker} on\nPhD A: They 're less animated .\nPhD C: Well but he has fewer {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he won't have more than eight and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU , so that sounds interesting . As a compliment to our front - end meeting\nGrad E: Dot EDU ?\nPhD C: and um so that 's gonna start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it or {disfmarker} or put a {vocalsound} push a button or something when they wanna make a note about \" oh boy you should probably erase those last few \" or uh \" wait I want this not to be recorded now \" or uh something like that s\nProfessor B: Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ?\nPostdoc G: The cross pads ?\nGrad E: Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads .\nPhD C: Cuz I was thinking you know if {disfmarker} if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know um and this came up talking to {disfmarker} to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate {disfmarker} to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: so I don't know if anyone has ideas or {disfmarker} you could even write down \" oh it 's about three twenty five and \" {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well what I was just suggesting is {disfmarker} is we have these {disfmarker} this cross pad just for this purpose\nGrad E: Yeah , and use that .\nProfessor B: and just use that\nGrad E: Not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: and if we sink it in {disfmarker}\nPhD C: That would be great .\nProfessor B: The other thing is eh\nPhD C: That be great .\nProfessor B: I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ?\nGrad E: I don't know . I don't know . I 'll send mail to Dan and ask . I {disfmarker} I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it 's one board with two digital channels .\nProfessor B: Oh it is one board .\nGrad E: E eight each . So it {disfmarker} it takes two fibers in to the one board . And so w I think if we wanna do that {disfmarker} more than that we 'd have to have two boards , and then you have the synchronization issue .\nProfessor B: But that 's a question because that would {disfmarker} if it was possible cuz it is i you know already we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor B: and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store , right it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: What is the limit on each of those f fiber channels , is it the\nGrad E: Eight .\nPhD D: It just {disfmarker} it 's eight channels come in , does it have do with the sampling rate ?\nGrad E: It 's eight . I have no idea . But each {disfmarker} each fiber channel has eight {disfmarker} eight channels and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card .\nProfessor B: It might be a hard limitation ,\nGrad E: So\nProfessor B: I mean one thing is it {disfmarker} the whole thing as I said is {disfmarker} is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes requirements up a bit\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: but\nPhD D: I was just wondering if {disfmarker} if that could change .\nGrad E: I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff .\nPhD D: If we could drop that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: So I {disfmarker} I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK on the uh are we done with that ? So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes , so I got a quote um We can fit {disfmarker} we have room for one more wireless and the wireless , this unit here is three fifty {disfmarker} three hundred fifty dollars , it {disfmarker} I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner {disfmarker} the receiver {disfmarker} the other end , that 's uh four thirty um and then also\nPhD C: For {disfmarker} for each ?\nPhD D: Wow .\nPhD C: I mean the tuner is four thirty for each .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: Wow .\nGrad E: And we just need one more so {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: Yeah at least w we got the good ones .\nGrad E: Yeah . So that 's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these .\nProfessor B: Yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: So if we wanna use a different set {disfmarker} headset the solution that the guy suggested and they {disfmarker} apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . And that 's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece and the {disfmarker} he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece .\nProfessor B: There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in , you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ?\nGrad E: Becau - the reason is the only {disfmarker} only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector .\nProfessor B: No I understand . The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this .\nGrad E: Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us ,\nPhD D: Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too ,\nGrad E: so .\nProfessor B: Well\nPhD D: they 'd\nProfessor B: no they 'll just charge us more , so it 's {disfmarker} this\nPhD D: Mmm .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker} so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?\nProfessor B: Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .\nGrad E: So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And {disfmarker} and see if that works .\nProfessor B: And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more .\nPhD C: Comfort .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK it 's just the {disfmarker} the\nGrad E: Right , it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: Could make our own handbands and\nGrad E: Um , and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA and so it will take about a week to get here .\nProfessor B: Yeah well it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um so OK to just go order ?\nProfessor B: We 're in this for the long term , yeah . Just order it .\nGrad E: OK\nPhD C: It 's a lot of money for a handband .\nGrad E: and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: cuz I think that 's how we did it before .\nProfessor B: Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a long time to get from LA .\nGrad E: OK . And then nine channels is the maximum we can do , so .\nProfessor B: Uh y right cuz {disfmarker} so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen\nGrad E: Without getting more stuff .\nProfessor B: and there 's six on the table so that 's nine .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Can I ask a really dumb question ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is there any way we can have you know like a {disfmarker} a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk that {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Probably .\nProfessor B: That 's a good idea .\nPhD C: I mean {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: That 's not a dumb question , it 's a good idea ,\nPhD C: Well I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the\nGrad F: That 's like the Conch .\nPhD C: Well but {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Like at conferences\nPhD A: you know r\nPhD C: well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people\nGrad F: See , look .\nPhD C: um and I don't know identifying somehow ?\nPhD D: so nail the chairs down .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , somehow .\nPhD C: You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer .\nGrad E: It 's not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: No that {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} no\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: that 's a very {disfmarker} if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work .\nPhD D: The Springer mike .\nPhD C: I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that .\nProfessor B: Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: A hand - held , yeah .\nProfessor B: that 's a good idea\nPhD D: Infinite expansion .\nProfessor B: Right . Kind of rules out overlap but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but uh\nPhD C: Well or also for you know if people are not\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Well we could just hand around the lapel .\nProfessor B: Uh no {disfmarker} no that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Rather than get a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No not the lapel .\nGrad E: do you want a handset ?\nProfessor B: No .\nGrad E: Well I mean is the {disfmarker} is the hand - held really any better ?\nPhD D: Liz hates the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yes .\nPhD C: I don't know\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: but I d I know the lapel is really suboptimal .\nProfessor B: No it {disfmarker} no it depends on the hand - held\nGrad E: Is awful ?\nProfessor B: but hand {disfmarker} many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it {disfmarker} it is less uh susceptible to hand noises . If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Right . I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of OK .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nGrad E: So I wonder if they have one that will hook up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . They have {disfmarker} What ?\nGrad E: I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves .\nPhD D: Well , you wouldn't want it to hook there you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room , right ?\nProfessor B: No that 's uh {disfmarker} you need a transmitter .\nGrad E: What ?\nPhD D: Is th isn't that built into the mike ?\nProfessor B: Oh I see . Get a {disfmarker} get a different radio , yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless\nProfessor B: Yeah . But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .\nPhD D: Have a little antenna coming out the bottom .\nGrad E: It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike , isn't it ?\nPhD D: But then the mike has to h\nPhD A: Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of\nProfessor B: No no {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: so right , so this is a good point , so yeah you have these {disfmarker} these mikes with a little antenna on the end right ?\nGrad E: OK . And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?\nProfessor B: I don't know . You 'll have to check with them ,\nGrad E: OK I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll ask .\nProfessor B: yeah . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's a great idea\nPhD D: It 's just a frequency .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then just sort of have that as the {disfmarker} and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and {disfmarker} and uh\nPhD C: Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large {disfmarker} the larger the group the less interaction {disfmarker} the less people are talking um over each other {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Pretty soon .\nPhD D: Mmm , yeah .\nPhD C: it just {disfmarker} there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: Um Gotta go .\nProfessor B: Off you go , yeah .\nGrad E: OK so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?\nPostdoc G: I {disfmarker} I thought of some extra {disfmarker} a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention .\nGrad E: OK .\nPostdoc G: One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine\nGrad E: uh Yep ,\nPostdoc G: and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month , I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten .\nPhD C: Uh it 's great {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Pretty close ,\nPostdoc G: So they 're still working .\nProfessor B: that 's good .\nPhD C: I j and this {disfmarker} I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something\nPhD D: Wow .\nGrad E: that 's good .\nPhD C: so it 's really great\nPostdoc G: It 's working out , thanks .\nPhD C: It 's really great .\nPostdoc G: Thanks . And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data It 's sort of a {disfmarker} a little bit {disfmarker} a little bit\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nProfessor B: Super idea .\nGrad E: Yep , that 'd be very interesting .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things ,\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'd love to hear what they have to say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's a great idea .\nPhD D: So if we got them to talk about this meeting , it would be a meta {disfmarker} meta meeting .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah , exa {vocalsound} exactly I guess {disfmarker} nested several layers ,\nProfessor B: Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us\nPostdoc G: but\nProfessor B: so how do we do this , is the only thing .\nPhD C: Or just have them talk amongst themselves .\nPhD D: Have them have their own meeting .\nPhD C: And have\nPostdoc G: Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,\nProfessor B: Oh .\nPostdoc G: yeah . Have them talk about the data and they {disfmarker} and they 've made observations to me\nPhD C: that would be great .\nPostdoc G: like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , you know it 's part of it 's {disfmarker} it 's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nGrad E: Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Be great .\nProfessor B: So maybe we could {disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Give us a status .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh good . OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .\nGrad E: Great .\nGrad J: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be {disfmarker} I 'll be working on this .\nGrad E: And are you staying at Berkeley or is {disfmarker} are you just here a semester ?\nGrad J: This is my second semester and last .\nGrad E: Ah second and last ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad J: So I leave\nProfessor B: He 's in the {disfmarker} he 's in the cour two two five D course .\nGrad J: Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course ,\nProfessor B: So , yeah .\nGrad J: yeah .\nGrad E: Good .\nPhD D: Welcome .\nPostdoc G: Then you {disfmarker} then you go back to Norway , that 's OK .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nGrad F: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the {vocalsound} echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK ,\nGrad E: Digits ?\nProfessor B: let 's do digits . OK .\nGrad E: And stop .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the general discussion?\nAnswer:", "input": "What was the general discussion?", "context": "Grad F: Test .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: Let 's see , I should be Two .\nPhD D: Up high {disfmarker}\nGrad E: As close to your mouth as you can get it .\nProfessor B: La\nPhD D: high as you can get .\nProfessor B: Is this channel one ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah , on your upper lip .\nPhD H: Channel one one one .\nProfessor B: Gee , OK . Yes . OK .\nGrad E: OK , so for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} For people wearing the wireless mikes , like {disfmarker} like this one , I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this {disfmarker} this sorta like that .\nPhD H: This is {disfmarker} chan channel channel one one two three\nGrad F: Channel five , channel five .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Mm - hmm . What do you do ,\nGrad E: It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples ,\nGrad F: Test , test test .\nProfessor B: you do it higher ?\nGrad E: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , I think we 're supposed to {disfmarker} that 's right .\nGrad E: And then also , for {disfmarker} for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth ,\nGrad F: Test test .\nPhD A: By the way , there was a bug . Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper\nPhD D: Oh it was .\nGrad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth ,\nPhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: so about like I 'm wearing it now .\nPhD D: Oh that 's interesting . So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nGrad E: so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth ,\nPhD H: It 's not always possible .\nPhD A: Hmm ?\nPhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nPostdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: Is that @ @ ? OK , thank you .\nGrad F: Adam , I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD D: O Oh oh I see .\nGrad F: uh , looks kinda low on channel five {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I see , I see .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad F: no ?\nGrad E: Channel five , s speak again .\nGrad F: Maybe not .\nPostdoc G: Hello .\nPhD A: Basically there were no counts\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's alright .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad E: I mean , we could {disfmarker} we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to .\nGrad F: It 's OK ?\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad F: Is this OK ?\nPhD H: OK .\nPhD D: I see what you mean .\nPhD C: Who 's channel B ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker} Uh , channel B is probably Liz .\nPhD C: Uh oh .\nPhD H: Uh channel B {disfmarker} I am channel B .\nProfessor B: You wanna close this ,\nPostdoc G: Channel eight , eight .\nProfessor B: or\nPhD C: No I\nGrad E: Thank you .\nPhD H: No , channel B .\nPhD A: Hello , hello .\nPhD C: yeah , yeah , you 're channel B .\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah .\nPhD C: So can you talk a bit ? I thought it might be too\nPhD H: OK , yeah , channel B , one two three four five .\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's alright . So , the gain isn't real good .\nProfessor B: We 're recording ,\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor B: right ?\nGrad E: OK , so we are recording .\nPhD H: Ah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: Um we {disfmarker} we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it . And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .\nPhD H: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: We {disfmarker} we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank . Um I {disfmarker} I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: so\nPhD D: California .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: California .\nPhD H: California .\nPhD A: Um may I make one suggestion ? Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth\nGrad E: Sure .\nPhD A: because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .\nGrad E: Oh .\nPhD C: A actually , wait a minute ,\nGrad E: Birth year ?\nPostdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around ?\nPhD D: Not for me .\nPostdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the other side ,\nPhD A: Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: O yeah .\nPhD D: But there 's no other date on the form .\nPhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nPostdoc G: Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .\nGrad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .\nPhD A: Anyway .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , that 's true .\nPhD C: I still don't see the problem .\nGrad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is alright\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: so , anyway . And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time , the speaker form only once , the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting . OK ? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form . And that should just be one person whose name I don't know . OK ?\nGrad F: Do you want this {pause} Adam ?\nGrad E: Uh sure . Thank you .\nProfessor B: So uh\nGrad E: OK so should we do agenda items ?\nProfessor B: Uh oh that 's a good idea . I shouldn't run the meeting .\nGrad E: Uh well I have {disfmarker} I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results . Anything else ?\nPhD C: I guess {disfmarker} what time do we have to leave ? Three thirty ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nGrad E: Why don't you go first then .\nPhD C: so .\nProfessor B: Yeah , good idea .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Um Well , I {disfmarker} I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams {disfmarker} a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who {disfmarker} Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um {vocalsound} you know separated {disfmarker} used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so {disfmarker} so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that {disfmarker} that 's twenty minutes or so ? Um yeah because I guess there 's some ,\nGrad E: Or so .\nPhD C: and Don can talk to Jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm {disfmarker} we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} was that {disfmarker} did that {disfmarker} did that recording have the glitch in the middle ?\nPostdoc G: I 'm puzzled by that . I {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} oh , I see .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Oh there was a glitch somewhere .\nPhD C: yeah , so that actually um\nGrad F: Was it twenty minutes in ,\nPhD C: if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know\nPostdoc G: I forgot about that .\nGrad F: I thought {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well it was interesting ,\nPostdoc G: Well , I mean , they {disfmarker}\nPhD A: suddenly {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent\nGrad E: I don't remember when it is .\nPostdoc G: but I was able to can transcribe\nPhD A: but i looking at {disfmarker} the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the {disfmarker} it was actually recognized\nPhD C: Wel\nGrad E: Oh no .\nGrad F: Yeah , that might be {disfmarker} that might be {disfmarker} that might be my fault .\nPostdoc G: Wow .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .\nGrad F: I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: No actually it was {disfmarker} yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um\nGrad F: yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time ,\nPostdoc G: Oh . That 's not good .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: so that 's what we have\nGrad E: Alright .\nGrad F: so\nPhD C: but that {disfmarker} that will be completely gone if this synch time problem\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: The {disfmarker} the glitch\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to\nPostdoc G: And the only glitch {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: yeah .\nPhD C: So you guys know .\nProfessor B: S sorry I haven't seen the email ,\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Th - the\nPostdoc G: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} wait\nProfessor B: what was the score ?\nPhD C: So here 's the actual copy of the email\nPostdoc G: we should say something about the glitch . He {disfmarker} he can say something about the glitch .\nPhD C: um oh OK\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Cuz it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} h it 's {disfmarker} it 's very small {disfmarker}\nPhD C: so does this glitch occur at other {disfmarker}\nGrad E: There {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized\nPostdoc G: very small . Yep .\nPhD C: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad E: so the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad E: and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing {disfmarker} doing click sounds .\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And is it only once that that happens ?\nGrad E: But yeah\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: it {disfmarker} right once in the middle .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong\nProfessor B: so {disfmarker} so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice ,\nPhD C: but\nGrad E: Um But that shouldn't affect anything\nPhD C: OK so that 's actually\nPostdoc G: S and it {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: you see this here ?\nPhD C: It {disfmarker} y it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah yeah \" bah \"\nPhD C: OK no {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: What happens is it actually affects the script that Don {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Huh .\nPhD C: I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it\nGrad E: Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything .\nPhD C: but they\nGrad F: Yeah , I don't know exactly what affected it\nPostdoc G: I agree . I agree .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I have {disfmarker}\nGrad F: but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you about it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: But I {disfmarker} I do remember {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: I 'll show you the point .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . It {disfmarker} it had no effect on my transcription ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: you know , I mean I {disfmarker} I had no trouble hearing it and {disfmarker} and having time bins\nGrad E: I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .\nPostdoc G: but there was a {disfmarker} Oh .\nPhD C: Well , the {disfmarker} the synch time {disfmarker} the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should ,\nGrad F: That 's what happened .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad E: Where {disfmarker} where they weren't monotonic .\nGrad F: There was {disfmarker} yeah , I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: right ? There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh , interesting .\nPhD C: And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right\nGrad E: Oh OK so that 's\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: so anyway it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah sounds like a bug .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Non - zero ? Um there are like more {disfmarker} cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran ,\nGrad E: The other one I saw was that it yeah .\nGrad F: I mean but there were there was a point .\nPhD C: Yeah that was fine . That {disfmarker} that was OK .\nGrad E: The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: and that definitely indicra indicates a bug .\nGrad F: Uh .\nPhD C: Well that would really be a problem , yeah . So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: um and what 's {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So that 's very encouraging .\nPhD C: this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Cool .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which\nPhD D: Trent Lott .\nPhD C: um I mean these are sort of funny ones ,\nPhD D: It 'll get those though .\nPhD C: there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see\nGrad E: I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: but um it 's pretty good .\nGrad E: because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ?\nPhD C: Well so I guess we can generate\nGrad E: Sounds likes ?\nPhD A: There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where {disfmarker} got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Yeah , and who cares ? And {disfmarker} and there were lots of {disfmarker} of course the \" uh uh \" - s , \" in on \" - s \" of uh \" - s .\nPhD A: Mmm , so if {disfmarker}\nPhD C: there 's {disfmarker} No those are actually\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or\nGrad E: Right . Ri - ri right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Did you say there 's no language for PZM ?\nPhD C: No language model , I mean those {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean {disfmarker} so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings .\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet .\nProfessor B: Well , we don't even know what that means ,\nPhD C: so {vocalsound} but this is really encouraging because\nProfessor B: so I\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right .\nPhD C: so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of {disfmarker} of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained {disfmarker} mostly trained recognizer\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and Switchboard - two is {disfmarker} got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic\nGrad E: Excellent .\nPhD C: and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did {disfmarker} had the ninety - three workshop\nPhD C: Um\nProfessor B: and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Oh yeah\nProfessor B: you know\nPhD C: I mean this is really ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: Well especially for the very first run , I mean you {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh it 's the {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: eh um\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: yeah\nGrad E: the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but\nPhD C: So and what al also this means is that\nPostdoc G: Right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Not Switchboard ,\nPhD A: Well it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people\nGrad E: uh Broadcast News .\nPhD C: especially I guess um with Jane that {disfmarker} that would help for {disfmarker} since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring . I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so you know the language model was straight from {disfmarker} from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or {disfmarker} or\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nGrad E: Yeah , so that 's great .\nPhD C: No .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: And actually {disfmarker} we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nPhD A: Well that 's {disfmarker} those are the only we ones there are ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: which I guess\nPhD D: I was just gonna say ,\nPhD C: so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of\nPhD D: yeah .\nPhD A: I mean\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: and I guess Ramana , so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: it 's {disfmarker} it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech .\nPhD D: It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech\nPhD C: So .\nPhD A: Oh yeah .\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah ,\nPhD C: Right , so it 's {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: but for Broadcast News when we {disfmarker} we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss .\nGrad E: Right , it was not a big deal .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: I should {disfmarker} I should say that {disfmarker} the language model is not just Switchboard\nPhD C: so I wou so that 's good .\nGrad E: Although combining em worked well .\nPhD A: it 's also {disfmarker} I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: uh because\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Like Trent Lott must have been from\nPhD A: mm - hmm , right .\nPhD C: I guess {vocalsound} Switchboard was before\nPhD A: Um By the way just {disfmarker} for fun we also ran ,\nPhD C: uh .\nProfessor B: Good point .\nPhD A: I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: so just for the heck of it I ran that\nGrad E: And it said a hundred percent male ?\nPhD A: um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .\nPhD C: The j\nPhD A: Yeah so\nGrad E: Oh it did ?\nPostdoc G: Oh that 's {disfmarker} I 'm glad .\nGrad E: It got all two genders ?\nPhD C: Yeah but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance\nPhD A: Yeah . Yes .\nPhD C: and uh and that 's interesting cuz I think the {disfmarker} their language models are quite different so and I {disfmarker} I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Right .\nPostdoc G: That makes a lot of sense ,\nPhD C: So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when {disfmarker} when we get new microphones\nPostdoc G: yeah . Very possible .\nProfessor B: Yeah I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would bet on that too\nPhD C: that would be worth it\nProfessor B: cuz he certainly in that {disfmarker} when as a {disfmarker} as a burp user he was {disfmarker} he was a pretty uh strong one .\nPhD C: um Yeah\nGrad E: Sheep .\nPhD C: he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he sounded to me just from {disfmarker} he sounded like a ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: what 's it a sheep or a goat ?\nProfessor B: Sheep .\nGrad E: A sheep .\nPhD C: Sheep ,\nGrad E: Baah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Sheep is good .\nPhD C: right . Sounded good .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right so um so I guess the good news is that\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker} and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no {disfmarker} no tailoring at all .\nPhD A: I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . The voca the vocabulary especially\nGrad E: Or just dictionary .\nPhD C: yeah .\nPhD A: Not that much the vocabulary actually\nPhD C: Yeah , so .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker} um well we have to see but {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . It 's pretty good um so then\nProfessor B: Have to add PZM and so on\nGrad E: And I have to try it on the far field mike\nProfessor B: but\nPhD C: PZM\nGrad E: yeah .\nPhD C: and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL . there 's things like that where , you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but in general it was really good and I 'm hoping {disfmarker} and this is {disfmarker} this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments , I mean it 's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information . For example about , you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times . Um so that 'll be something that actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place . Because it 's just gonna give us time marks\nPhD D: But you know {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Well we 've done that for one meeting .\nPhD C: so . For forced alignment .\nGrad E: Uh oh oh f not for words\nPhD C: Ye - right .\nGrad E: I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not {disfmarker} not for words .\nPhD C: Right . So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and then I was thinking it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription . Maybe actually mark the word boundaries .\nPhD C: Oh or {disfmarker} i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy .\nGrad E: Right , right .\nPhD C: It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around , if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good . So that 's about it .\nProfessor B: I r\nPhD D: I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though , I mean if we 're pr\nGrad E: That we 're starting so well ?\nPhD D: yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody 's gonna do well on\nProfessor B: Oh\nGrad E: Don't worry about it w d that 's that 's the close talking mikes . Try it on the P Z Ms and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor B: Yeah , which {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} well n n n n\nPhD D: So the real value of the database is these ?\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , abso well no but\nProfessor B: I mean there 's still just the w the percentages and , I mean they 're not {disfmarker} a as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps\nPhD C: This i yeah . This is not that good .\nProfessor B: there 's probably overlaps in {disfmarker} in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so but {disfmarker} but there 's other phenomena , it 's a meeting , it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes but uh yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could , I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor B: and uh see if it 's , you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it 's not maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something and {disfmarker} and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: No I think it 's really , I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the {disfmarker} the text um yeah they 're pretty good so and {disfmarker} and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard so that 's good . And um let 's see there was one more thing I wanted to {disfmarker} to mention {disfmarker} I can't remember um Sorry can't remember . anyway it 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Congratulations is really great .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's really good .\nPhD C: so Andreas set up this recognizer and {disfmarker} by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there so I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um so\nPhD A: We {disfmarker} we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . That 's {disfmarker} you know if {disfmarker} if there are more machines um uh here plus people can {disfmarker} could run their own uh you know variants of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the recognition {pause} runs um certainly doable . Um .\nProfessor B: Yeah and {disfmarker} well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Seems reasonable .\nPostdoc G: I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Which is um so this issue {vocalsound} of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted {disfmarker} Yeah , well , so what I mean is um the {disfmarker} uh the data that you take into SRI , first {disfmarker} first question , you 're maintaining it in {disfmarker} in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that {disfmarker} that kind of stuff , right ?\nPhD A: U um\nPhD C: From the outside world or\nPostdoc G: By uh people uh who are not associated with this project .\nPhD A: Oh .\nGrad E: It 's human subjects issues , I told you about that .\nPhD C: Um oh .\nPostdoc G: Exactly .\nPhD C: Well OK we have n no names . Although I sh um\nGrad E: That {disfmarker} that 's not the issue ,\nPhD C: de audio data itself ?\nGrad E: it 's just the audio data itself , until people have a chance to edit it .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm , exactly .\nPhD C: Uh so well I can {disfmarker} I can protect my directories through there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right now they 're not {disfmarker} they 're in the speech group directories which {disfmarker} so I will {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: I didn't know that actually .\nProfessor B: Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,\nPhD C: Yeah OK .\nProfessor B: say it 's OK .\nPhD C: Right OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , we had to get them to approve em and then i cuz {disfmarker} cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's but this {disfmarker} this meeting that you have , no problem cuz I {disfmarker} I well I mean I {disfmarker} I speak for myself\nGrad E: It 's us .\nPostdoc G: but {disfmarker} but I think that we didn't do anything that but well anyway so {vocalsound} uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects\nPhD C: That 's true .\nPostdoc G: and I don't know how that stands , I mean if you {disfmarker} if you get fantastic results and it 's involving {comment} data which {disfmarker} which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know but I wanted to raise that issue ,\nProfessor B: Well we ,\nPostdoc G: that 's all .\nProfessor B: I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it {disfmarker} hopefully it will be fairly quick but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on it 's just that we 're\nGrad E: Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: and get back any bleeps that they want\nPhD C: Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought .\nProfessor B: It 's gonna be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part .\nPhD A: U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling , um I don't know who , I mean how this was done but is {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} are there any um {vocalsound} issues with downsampling\nPhD C: Don did this .\nPhD A: because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly um so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand . And is there any um i are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ?\nGrad F: There are lots of w {vocalsound} there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on ,\nPhD A: OK . Right . OK .\nGrad F: like anti - aliasing stuff .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} th\nGrad E: I don't think we even know which one I assume you 're using syncat to do it ?\nGrad F: No , I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample .\nGrad E: Or sound resample ?\nPhD C: Re - re ref\nGrad E: Resample .\nPhD C: yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms .\nGrad F: RSMP . Yeah , I don't really .\nPhD C: Missing all the vowels .\nGrad F: I just {disfmarker} yeah I found it .\nPhD C: Some of the vowels ,\nGrad E: Not all of them .\nPhD C: almost all the vowels , that 's the hard part .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,\nGrad E: And a few of the consonants .\nPhD A: I mean segment them but not downsample them .\nPhD C: Yeah we could {disfmarker} we could try that and {disfmarker} and compare\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and feed them to {disfmarker} feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if {disfmarker} if the SRI front - end does something .\nGrad F: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I suspect that 's sort of premature optimization , but Sure .\nPhD C: We can try it . I {disfmarker} I only downsampled them first cuz I was\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I mean that 's just one line {disfmarker} that 's one line of code to comment at\nPhD C: yeah\nPhD A: Right and {disfmarker} and it doesn't {disfmarker} is no more work {vocalsound} for um you know for us .\nGrad F: so\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: Well they 're just bigger to transfer , that 's why I s downsampled them before but\nPhD A: Well but they 're only twice as big so\nPhD C: Well I mean that was {disfmarker} if it 's the same then we can downsample here\nPhD A: I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a\nPhD C: but if it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: so , but no , I mean it 's not {disfmarker} i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it {disfmarker}\nPhD C: We could try that .\nPhD A: Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know\nGrad F: it would {disfmarker}\nPhD A: minus the transfer time it would {disfmarker} it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's about a fifty minute drive , right ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why\nPhD C: Well it takes more disk space too so I was just {disfmarker}\nPhD A: and , you know , what {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad F: Mmm . In the front - end we could do that .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So you just train {disfmarker} just different filters\nGrad F: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is\nGrad F: Yeah , I can imagine it would be {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD C: So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences .\nGrad F: I mean I guess there 's some {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD A: So in other words right ,\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that . I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other I don't think that gives you any information .\nPhD C: Well it 's just as easy to {disfmarker} to give you the sixteen K individual ,\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: it was just more disk space you know for storing them\nProfessor B: Are you {disfmarker} are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ?\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: Mel cepstrum .\nProfessor B: So probably doesn't matter .\nPhD C: Well we could try .\nGrad F: There 's {disfmarker} there 's your answer .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but it wouldn't hurt to try ,\nPhD C: Could easily try\nPhD A: That 's what I would assume but you never know ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: you know .\nProfessor B: Sure . No the reason I say this\nPostdoc G: Just {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not {disfmarker} b you wouldn't expect to be so much but\nPhD C: Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti stick them somewhere\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really not a problem .\nPhD A: Actually , no .\nPhD C: and I 'll rerun it with\nPhD A: Don't stop . Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters ,\nGrad F: Keep going . Yeah .\nPhD A: so shouldn't use {disfmarker} you should s you know , get\nGrad F: Yeah , I mean I 'll {disfmarker} I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same ,\nPhD C: OK .\nPhD A:  Right .\nGrad F: it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right . Right .\nGrad F: and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory ,\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: I mean I corrected all {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: that 's not a problem .\nPhD C: I mean I hand - edited the whole {disfmarker} the whole meeting so that can be run it 's just {disfmarker} Once we get the {disfmarker} the bug out .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: One {disfmarker} one question which is I {disfmarker} I had the impression {comment} from this {disfmarker} from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc G: is that I thought that in order to\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: so it was {disfmarker} so it 's like there 's already down\nGrad E: There 's one level that 's already happening right here .\nProfessor B: This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs\nPostdoc G: OK .\nGrad E: Right .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: And it gets downsampled to sixteen .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: And that 's actually said in your meeting ,\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh OK .\nPhD C: that 's how I know that .\nPostdoc G: That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} It 's like are we downsampling to sixteen ?\nProfessor B: It 's a digital audio orientation for the board\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor B: it 's in the monitor so it 's\nPhD C: Thank God it 's not {vocalsound} more than that .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And I have no idea what filter it 's using ,\nGrad F: Is eight kilohertz {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ?\nGrad E: so\nProfessor B: For telephone stuff .\nGrad E: Telephone .\nPhD D: Telephone .\nGrad F: Yeah that 's what I was gonna say , I mean like {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database\nGrad F: so Oh , I see , so .\nProfessor B: and so that was a standard for that sixteen s\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing .\nProfessor B: Sixteen is more common for {disfmarker} for uh broadband stuff that isn't {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: That isn't music .\nProfessor B: that isn't music and isn't telephone ,\nPhD C: And I guess if you 're comparing like {disfmarker} uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: Why is that ?\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: right ? Well I don I mean if it 's any better\nProfessor B: No actually I would think that you would {disfmarker} you would get better {disfmarker} you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike .\nGrad E: All the way around I 'd think .\nProfessor B: Uh but who knows ? I mean we do {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna find all this stuff out ,\nPhD C: Yeah well we could try it .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: we don't know .\nGrad E: We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans .\nPhD C: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um well {disfmarker} well it 's sort of related but um good news also uh I got {disfmarker} well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on {disfmarker} on\nPhD A: They 're less animated .\nPhD C: Well but he has fewer {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he won't have more than eight and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU , so that sounds interesting . As a compliment to our front - end meeting\nGrad E: Dot EDU ?\nPhD C: and um so that 's gonna start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it or {disfmarker} or put a {vocalsound} push a button or something when they wanna make a note about \" oh boy you should probably erase those last few \" or uh \" wait I want this not to be recorded now \" or uh something like that s\nProfessor B: Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ?\nPostdoc G: The cross pads ?\nGrad E: Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads .\nPhD C: Cuz I was thinking you know if {disfmarker} if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know um and this came up talking to {disfmarker} to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate {disfmarker} to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: so I don't know if anyone has ideas or {disfmarker} you could even write down \" oh it 's about three twenty five and \" {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well what I was just suggesting is {disfmarker} is we have these {disfmarker} this cross pad just for this purpose\nGrad E: Yeah , and use that .\nProfessor B: and just use that\nGrad E: Not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: and if we sink it in {disfmarker}\nPhD C: That would be great .\nProfessor B: The other thing is eh\nPhD C: That be great .\nProfessor B: I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ?\nGrad E: I don't know . I don't know . I 'll send mail to Dan and ask . I {disfmarker} I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it 's one board with two digital channels .\nProfessor B: Oh it is one board .\nGrad E: E eight each . So it {disfmarker} it takes two fibers in to the one board . And so w I think if we wanna do that {disfmarker} more than that we 'd have to have two boards , and then you have the synchronization issue .\nProfessor B: But that 's a question because that would {disfmarker} if it was possible cuz it is i you know already we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor B: and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store , right it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: What is the limit on each of those f fiber channels , is it the\nGrad E: Eight .\nPhD D: It just {disfmarker} it 's eight channels come in , does it have do with the sampling rate ?\nGrad E: It 's eight . I have no idea . But each {disfmarker} each fiber channel has eight {disfmarker} eight channels and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card .\nProfessor B: It might be a hard limitation ,\nGrad E: So\nProfessor B: I mean one thing is it {disfmarker} the whole thing as I said is {disfmarker} is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes requirements up a bit\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: but\nPhD D: I was just wondering if {disfmarker} if that could change .\nGrad E: I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff .\nPhD D: If we could drop that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: So I {disfmarker} I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK on the uh are we done with that ? So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes , so I got a quote um We can fit {disfmarker} we have room for one more wireless and the wireless , this unit here is three fifty {disfmarker} three hundred fifty dollars , it {disfmarker} I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner {disfmarker} the receiver {disfmarker} the other end , that 's uh four thirty um and then also\nPhD C: For {disfmarker} for each ?\nPhD D: Wow .\nPhD C: I mean the tuner is four thirty for each .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: Wow .\nGrad E: And we just need one more so {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: Yeah at least w we got the good ones .\nGrad E: Yeah . So that 's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these .\nProfessor B: Yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: So if we wanna use a different set {disfmarker} headset the solution that the guy suggested and they {disfmarker} apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . And that 's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece and the {disfmarker} he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece .\nProfessor B: There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in , you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ?\nGrad E: Becau - the reason is the only {disfmarker} only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector .\nProfessor B: No I understand . The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this .\nGrad E: Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us ,\nPhD D: Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too ,\nGrad E: so .\nProfessor B: Well\nPhD D: they 'd\nProfessor B: no they 'll just charge us more , so it 's {disfmarker} this\nPhD D: Mmm .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker} so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?\nProfessor B: Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .\nGrad E: So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And {disfmarker} and see if that works .\nProfessor B: And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more .\nPhD C: Comfort .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK it 's just the {disfmarker} the\nGrad E: Right , it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: Could make our own handbands and\nGrad E: Um , and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA and so it will take about a week to get here .\nProfessor B: Yeah well it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um so OK to just go order ?\nProfessor B: We 're in this for the long term , yeah . Just order it .\nGrad E: OK\nPhD C: It 's a lot of money for a handband .\nGrad E: and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: cuz I think that 's how we did it before .\nProfessor B: Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a long time to get from LA .\nGrad E: OK . And then nine channels is the maximum we can do , so .\nProfessor B: Uh y right cuz {disfmarker} so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen\nGrad E: Without getting more stuff .\nProfessor B: and there 's six on the table so that 's nine .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Can I ask a really dumb question ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is there any way we can have you know like a {disfmarker} a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk that {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Probably .\nProfessor B: That 's a good idea .\nPhD C: I mean {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: That 's not a dumb question , it 's a good idea ,\nPhD C: Well I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the\nGrad F: That 's like the Conch .\nPhD C: Well but {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Like at conferences\nPhD A: you know r\nPhD C: well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people\nGrad F: See , look .\nPhD C: um and I don't know identifying somehow ?\nPhD D: so nail the chairs down .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , somehow .\nPhD C: You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer .\nGrad E: It 's not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: No that {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} no\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: that 's a very {disfmarker} if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work .\nPhD D: The Springer mike .\nPhD C: I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that .\nProfessor B: Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: A hand - held , yeah .\nProfessor B: that 's a good idea\nPhD D: Infinite expansion .\nProfessor B: Right . Kind of rules out overlap but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but uh\nPhD C: Well or also for you know if people are not\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Well we could just hand around the lapel .\nProfessor B: Uh no {disfmarker} no that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Rather than get a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No not the lapel .\nGrad E: do you want a handset ?\nProfessor B: No .\nGrad E: Well I mean is the {disfmarker} is the hand - held really any better ?\nPhD D: Liz hates the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yes .\nPhD C: I don't know\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: but I d I know the lapel is really suboptimal .\nProfessor B: No it {disfmarker} no it depends on the hand - held\nGrad E: Is awful ?\nProfessor B: but hand {disfmarker} many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it {disfmarker} it is less uh susceptible to hand noises . If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Right . I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of OK .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nGrad E: So I wonder if they have one that will hook up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . They have {disfmarker} What ?\nGrad E: I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves .\nPhD D: Well , you wouldn't want it to hook there you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room , right ?\nProfessor B: No that 's uh {disfmarker} you need a transmitter .\nGrad E: What ?\nPhD D: Is th isn't that built into the mike ?\nProfessor B: Oh I see . Get a {disfmarker} get a different radio , yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless\nProfessor B: Yeah . But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .\nPhD D: Have a little antenna coming out the bottom .\nGrad E: It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike , isn't it ?\nPhD D: But then the mike has to h\nPhD A: Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of\nProfessor B: No no {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: so right , so this is a good point , so yeah you have these {disfmarker} these mikes with a little antenna on the end right ?\nGrad E: OK . And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?\nProfessor B: I don't know . You 'll have to check with them ,\nGrad E: OK I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll ask .\nProfessor B: yeah . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's a great idea\nPhD D: It 's just a frequency .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then just sort of have that as the {disfmarker} and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and {disfmarker} and uh\nPhD C: Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large {disfmarker} the larger the group the less interaction {disfmarker} the less people are talking um over each other {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Pretty soon .\nPhD D: Mmm , yeah .\nPhD C: it just {disfmarker} there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: Um Gotta go .\nProfessor B: Off you go , yeah .\nGrad E: OK so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?\nPostdoc G: I {disfmarker} I thought of some extra {disfmarker} a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention .\nGrad E: OK .\nPostdoc G: One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine\nGrad E: uh Yep ,\nPostdoc G: and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month , I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten .\nPhD C: Uh it 's great {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Pretty close ,\nPostdoc G: So they 're still working .\nProfessor B: that 's good .\nPhD C: I j and this {disfmarker} I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something\nPhD D: Wow .\nGrad E: that 's good .\nPhD C: so it 's really great\nPostdoc G: It 's working out , thanks .\nPhD C: It 's really great .\nPostdoc G: Thanks . And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data It 's sort of a {disfmarker} a little bit {disfmarker} a little bit\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nProfessor B: Super idea .\nGrad E: Yep , that 'd be very interesting .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things ,\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'd love to hear what they have to say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's a great idea .\nPhD D: So if we got them to talk about this meeting , it would be a meta {disfmarker} meta meeting .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah , exa {vocalsound} exactly I guess {disfmarker} nested several layers ,\nProfessor B: Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us\nPostdoc G: but\nProfessor B: so how do we do this , is the only thing .\nPhD C: Or just have them talk amongst themselves .\nPhD D: Have them have their own meeting .\nPhD C: And have\nPostdoc G: Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,\nProfessor B: Oh .\nPostdoc G: yeah . Have them talk about the data and they {disfmarker} and they 've made observations to me\nPhD C: that would be great .\nPostdoc G: like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , you know it 's part of it 's {disfmarker} it 's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nGrad E: Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Be great .\nProfessor B: So maybe we could {disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Give us a status .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh good . OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .\nGrad E: Great .\nGrad J: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be {disfmarker} I 'll be working on this .\nGrad E: And are you staying at Berkeley or is {disfmarker} are you just here a semester ?\nGrad J: This is my second semester and last .\nGrad E: Ah second and last ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad J: So I leave\nProfessor B: He 's in the {disfmarker} he 's in the cour two two five D course .\nGrad J: Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course ,\nProfessor B: So , yeah .\nGrad J: yeah .\nGrad E: Good .\nPhD D: Welcome .\nPostdoc G: Then you {disfmarker} then you go back to Norway , that 's OK .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nGrad F: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the {vocalsound} echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK ,\nGrad E: Digits ?\nProfessor B: let 's do digits . OK .\nGrad E: And stop .", "answers": ["The group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data. Recognition performance was very good, indicating promising results for forced alignment procedures and the ability to analyze other important signal information, e.g. prosody and overlapping speech. It was decided that close-talking data should be downsampled and fed to the SRI recognizer to compare recognition performance, and that data from the far-field microphones should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible. The group also discussed recording setup and equipment issues. "], "pred": " What was the general discussion? Answer: What was the general discussion? Answer: What was the general discussion?

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Uh fourth meeting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We have to do what ?\nProject Manager: Some extra deciding .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} W what ? Alri alright . We'll see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: And the video button . The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .\nProject Manager: Well if I look at it , the side the side view {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , at the back {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then you can add suggestions .\nProject Manager: Oh yeah alright . Yeah {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I I don't want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ?\nUser Interface: No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the back . Yeah . {vocalsound} We thought about {disfmarker} Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . {vocalsound} And we thought about the logo big in the middle .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe that's too much\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way .\nUser Interface: No I don't think {disfmarker} And the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: That's basically what we were thinking about ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: W\nUser Interface: And about the side view um {disfmarker} This the front won't be as thick ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I see , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course ,\nProject Manager: Well . Yeah I see it .\nIndustrial Designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .\nUser Interface: Well , it won't be visible . Mm ?\nProject Manager: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Why ? {vocalsound} Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mean uh the the the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: {gap} If y {vocalsound} If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} In the middle in the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: You you have it a bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .\nProject Manager: And how large is it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , that's the question .\nIndustrial Designer: That's the question .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well {disfmarker} Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? {gap} This was Mike's prototype ,\nProject Manager: Well uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it .\nProject Manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: But now you have a totally different {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well , they lay there all the time .\nIndustrial Designer: The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They the the the the the side view ,\nIndustrial Designer: Side ? Uh oh the side ?\nProject Manager: we didn't uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we we he drew the s the side ,\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But you you hold it like this .\nUser Interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it ,\nIndustrial Designer: You're not holding it like this or something .\nUser Interface: you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this .\nProject Manager: No no no .\nIndustrial Designer: You have it more like this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way .\nMarketing: Like you're holding your telephone .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .\nUser Interface: Hmm . That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree on this .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No but but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree\nProject Manager: Yeah well\nUser Interface: and only Nils {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .\nUser Interface: But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . So uh I c I c\nIndustrial Designer: If necessary .\nProject Manager: Well , we'll we we'll do it like this .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable .\nProject Manager: No {disfmarker} No ,\nIndustrial Designer: But do you\nProject Manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} In the market uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think .\nProject Manager: No not totally .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Not totally , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh {vocalsound} every everyone into account . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: And you might be uh {disfmarker} You might be target customer .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't know .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we don't know ,\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe a thousand people ,\nProject Manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research .\nIndustrial Designer: or a million people .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Let it be .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . So that's that .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh any other suggestions ?\nProject Manager: No , I think it's great .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But what about the redesigning ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Comes to that later .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um you . Uh c You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Walter . {vocalsound} You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You're very personal again .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Great .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's more useful than just {vocalsound} speaking .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , this is just a short intro .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this .\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I know , but {vocalsound} I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire .\nProject Manager: To the customers ?\nIndustrial Designer: So and we ha we have answer now ?\nProject Manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , but I can't can s\nProject Manager: Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: But um {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but uh , you know {disfmarker} We dis we di {vocalsound} we designed it to be perfect .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we {vocalsound} we know where we stand .\nProject Manager: Well , one .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten .\nProject Manager: Well so it's point four . Easy to find t\nIndustrial Designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right , so {disfmarker} Right . Uh is it good-looking ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well , I guess uh I think uh {vocalsound} it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . {gap}\nProject Manager: Two . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um {vocalsound} uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: The titanium might be uh f for older people .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It you put uh put a black front on it or something .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh no . {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also {disfmarker} Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and not only for youth uh young people .\nUser Interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . I totally agree .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , the fourteen yeah .\nProject Manager: We we have to get get on , go through this .\nMarketing: Right , a number please .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so .\nMarketing: So the last one is seven .\nUser Interface: Um , no it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Easy to change channels ?\nProject Manager: No , not false . It's one .\nMarketing: Oh , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nProject Manager: Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it {gap} .\nMarketing: Change channels ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: So I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . You {disfmarker} How can you make it any easier ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} With two huge buttons .\nMarketing: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , huge is a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nMarketing: Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?\nProject Manager: Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s\nUser Interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well six then . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: because of the colour . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Six ? Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so ,\nProject Manager: Are the functions easy to learn ?\nIndustrial Designer: but um um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} We have so few functions , so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nUser Interface: Well , I should {disfmarker} I think two ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: because {vocalsound} the voice recorder is n not self learning . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Alright . Two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , but just do some {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} We we {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I th I th I think this is too time consuming .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we take too much time ?\nProject Manager: Uh not not towards you ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: but towards this all .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Th this is {gap} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: We you have to put it to the customers .\nMarketing: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? {vocalsound} R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nProject Manager: Uh well well a bit , so four .\nMarketing: Four . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , very much . One .\nProject Manager: One . And features included also one . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Device fancy feeling .\nIndustrial Designer: And I think fancy-feeling too ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , cool man .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the titanium back . Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's great .\nProject Manager: Is the device easy to use ?\nUser Interface: The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes we have {vocalsound} not many buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: So well maybe two\nProject Manager: Two , three .\nUser Interface: Two {vocalsound} two .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the voice recorder .\nMarketing: Well , with the uh {disfmarker} Three .\nProject Manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?\nUser Interface: T\nIndustrial Designer: F\nProject Manager: Well in our covers , in our fronts .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So yes , one .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . One or two . Yeah .\nUser Interface: One or two , another two .\nMarketing: Nah f four I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Four ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} If you look at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Oh okay . Okay {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well three .\nMarketing: Three , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can also have {gap} front with uh with fruit on it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , that's true .\nProject Manager: Is the material attractive ?\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: This is the last meeting ?\nProject Manager: Yes , but we we have to design much more ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: The average will uh come later .\nProject Manager: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly .\nProject Manager: Oh . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point .\nIndustrial Designer: My god .\nProject Manager: I had to fit it in .\nMarketing: It has to go to twelve , right ?\nProject Manager: I twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four .\nIndustrial Designer: The what ?\nProject Manager: The sample speaker ,\nIndustrial Designer: The {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Out .\nProject Manager: the s sensor .\nMarketing: That's easy . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: Kick it out .\nUser Interface: The what ?\nProject Manager: We have to go to twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Yeah . The speaker .\nProject Manager: The speaker costs far , by far the most .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option .\nMarketing: That's some wrong info , man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It it isn't worth it .\nIndustrial Designer: No . No , d th No .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: We could make two different versions , one with and one without .\nMarketing: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But for this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's just extra . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: So , zero .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we go to fourteen point six .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually .\nMarketing: What more ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Batteries are uh quite {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh no , no no no .\nProject Manager: w a remote control has a battery .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think .\nUser Interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nMarketing: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Can't we do that with a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: Why not ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh that uh y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: because my information says it .\nProject Manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yeah . Regular is normal .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And simple ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Simple .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nothing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Elementary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Your part .\nIndustrial Designer: I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report .\nProject Manager: What happens if we do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Single {disfmarker} Well you have to use a chip . So {disfmarker} Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: How much do we win ? One .\nUser Interface: We we we {disfmarker} Why ?\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: We have very little options furthermore , for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface: Uh well we have to put that in .\nMarketing: Yeah , we need to have the {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: That that's a fact . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there ,\nMarketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but it's only one half .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Nah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it d it doesn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , that's n It's not relevant .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah , you must change the chip uh back .\nProject Manager: then you s then you only have one half left .\nUser Interface: You must change the chip back , Nils .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nMarketing: No , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Then the whole concept is uh\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} we oh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} You can make you can make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: You have to use it .\nMarketing: But if you don't sell\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? No , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Y we don't need both .\nProject Manager: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Says {gap} .\nProject Manager: Says , his {disfmarker} Uh that was in the second meeting , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I I did single curve to {disfmarker} Well you said s double curved ,\nUser Interface: I ?\nProject Manager: uh he ,\nUser Interface: {gap} ?\nProject Manager: because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We can also make it flat .\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} No\nIndustrial Designer: But what what did what do n\nMarketing: no no no .\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What do they mean with the curves ?\nProject Manager: Curved ?\nIndustrial Designer: Is th Is this a curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes , that's curved .\nIndustrial Designer: One curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .\nProject Manager: No , it's one curve .\nIndustrial Designer: It's how you {disfmarker} It's how you look at it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} One curve . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: One curve , simple .\nIndustrial Designer: Well then we have a huge problem I think .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: We have a big financial problem .\nUser Interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy .\nProject Manager: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But {disfmarker} Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah or we could replace it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you if you make it cool to have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: By the way , we also have this one .\nMarketing: Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: Oh , costs nothing . That's nice . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .\nProject Manager: Plastic is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes , but I just got it .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well that's pretty uh l\nUser Interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium ,\nMarketing: That is pretty stupid . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: N not very practical . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: uh titanium-coloured plastic ?\nProject Manager: Who ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You want to dump the titanium ?\nUser Interface: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper .\nProject Manager: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But I'm n I don't agree .\nUser Interface: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again .\nIndustrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .\nUser Interface: Ah no no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same .\nProject Manager: No , I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Well , I do think so .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Y\nProject Manager: Yes . And the feel ,\nUser Interface: {gap} feel .\nProject Manager: and th that it is strong , and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people .\nProject Manager: We still {vocalsound} we had to focus to get more people from the younger group ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but not lose the one {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think the titanium is very important .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then .\nUser Interface: We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think .\nMarketing: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Well what else ?\nUser Interface: No , nothing .\nIndustrial Designer: W I mean uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or you shou {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Amen .\nMarketing: Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Because you have lots of functions {vocalsound} in it too .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well yeah . Alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Why can't I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I agree with that . So we u we use uh {disfmarker} Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic .\nProject Manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back .\nProject Manager: I I'll talk to the managers . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No no no no . W Titanium stays there .\nProject Manager: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah this is good ,\nMarketing: Osl {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but it it's not good enough . {vocalsound} So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .\nProject Manager: Ah those {gap} those account managers , what do th d what do they know ?\nUser Interface: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Come on . Riot . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: What do we {disfmarker} Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes , yes .\nUser Interface: No because we did not know anything about it .\nProject Manager: One and a half Euros . Hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah al alright , yeah .\nMarketing: If you don't have the money , you can't make it .\nIndustrial Designer: But we have to deal with it now . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive .\nProject Manager: So ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So we have to make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: Titanium gone and add plastic .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but then we've got money left .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?\nProject Manager: Well , no it's just uh all plastic .\nIndustrial Designer: No {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well alright . Huh .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh six . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's just free , man .\nIndustrial Designer: A lot of plastic , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Four . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: No two for the to make it clear .\nProject Manager: But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And we still have money left .\nUser Interface: Yeah . W\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do we want , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: I want gold plating .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No no um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah right . I want chrome . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I think uh the case is double curved then .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Because you y have that curve\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have we have to uh fill {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and you have that curve .\nProject Manager: Y Oh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well , th that that is the problem .\nUser Interface: Yeah well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we ha {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: No no no , but th that's not f um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Safe .\nUser Interface: Well y we have curves in all directions .\nIndustrial Designer: Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped ,\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} alright .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so it it can be done . {vocalsound} But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven .\nProject Manager: Finance ?\nUser Interface: I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it .\nProject Manager: Well , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Guys ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We have to dump our titanium ,\nMarketing: Shoot .\nProject Manager: and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Objection .\nUser Interface: Pro project . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project . {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I think it's uh {disfmarker} Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , me too .\nProject Manager: That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason ,\nIndustrial Designer: Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: And uh unrealistic .\nProject Manager: but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .\nUser Interface: Well we we we used our creativity ,\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: but we just had to adapt it to the costs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Which isn't very practical ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nei . Uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but {vocalsound} that's the way .\nProject Manager: Well , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh leadership next .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Terrible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh teamwork ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leadership .\nUser Interface: Leadership ? Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It was very democratic . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh yeah well {vocalsound} I think so also .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But o alright , the teamwork ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess .\nProject Manager: No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Right yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah , think so too .\nProject Manager: Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It was a complete disaster .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} Uh it it it uh it is uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen .\nProject Manager: It's also a It's both the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Or not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard .\nProject Manager: I liked this SMARTboard ,\nIndustrial Designer: That's the digital panel .\nProject Manager: but I hated that one .\nMarketing: This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ?\nProject Manager: Well it's both a SMARTboard .\nIndustrial Designer: That's that's the smart\nMarketing: Yeah right . B but you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh they're both SMARTboards . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: This is just a large t large television .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A televi Yeah .\nMarketing: You u you use the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .\nMarketing: Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , wi w which one did you like ?\nUser Interface: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Left or right ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That one isn't accurate . {vocalsound} It just doesn't work .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .\nMarketing: You can {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes . Th that is so .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I didn't use uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the {vocalsound} these th\nProject Manager: We're now talking about the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't need a SMARTboard .\nUser Interface: {gap} Well we we used that one ,\nIndustrial Designer: Nei It it's much m {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we needed it . I think .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an {disfmarker} I I like it .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay , alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh you can uh {disfmarker} I I sent it about three times now . Uh {vocalsound} a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah , it is .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The simple uh sch school board .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I agree .\nProject Manager: And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ?\nIndustrial Designer: I I didn't use it .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop .\nProject Manager: I used it uh just to check it out , but uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself ,\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} It isn't practical . Right .\nProject Manager: and then you're going to send it , yeah . Well , no .\nIndustrial Designer: W {vocalsound} But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block .\nMarketing: Your notepad . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's , no , it it's useless .\nUser Interface: Well I I drew this . {gap} Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah alright . For drawings ,\nProject Manager: For drawings , yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: but not for personal notes . I think that's not very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} N notes mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I mean {vocalsound} you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: If you've {disfmarker} If you've {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict {disfmarker} Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I understand .\nMarketing: That Stefan use .\nIndustrial Designer: But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . {vocalsound} You can't {disfmarker} It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . It's it's only useful if you have to draw something .\nUser Interface: Yeah . But then uh it's really useful , I think .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep . Alright . Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mu Yeah right .\nProject Manager: Of course great .\nMarketing: Yeah , great . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Can we keep them ? Uh .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: B by my {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wireless uh wireless things .\nUser Interface: Thanks Project Manager . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Other uh things we used here ? I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well these chairs , man . {vocalsound} Really great .\nIndustrial Designer: Well did you really uh {disfmarker} Did you really take uh take those in account ? {vocalsound} I {vocalsound} half of time I didn't notice they were there . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No . I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . {vocalsound} I don't care about it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we shouldn't talk about that .\nUser Interface: Well I did .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Because {vocalsound} this is a realistic environment .\nProject Manager: Well w why not ? Uh etcetera {gap} {disfmarker} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} N new ideas found ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule {vocalsound} {disfmarker} What ? {vocalsound} For future um meetings {vocalsound} you have got ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I missed uh the option to uh to email ,\nMarketing: Communicate in between .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: Chatting and emailing .\nUser Interface: Email or chat or something .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , right . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but that's one n new idea . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: Well , new ideas found by this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Not . Nothing .\nMarketing: Well , more more information in the beginning .\nProject Manager: We don't want this . We hate this .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Digital pen is useless . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No it isn't .\nProject Manager: Yeah , for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . So it isn't useless .\nProject Manager: But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker} No {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's still an expensive uh expensive {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Because this is huge\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: uh this v very very uh expensive paper .\nUser Interface: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: With the mouse it is {disfmarker} No . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: But if w Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Well and if {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching .\nUser Interface: Uh indeed .\nIndustrial Designer: And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? {vocalsound} A\nProject Manager: Well no . I hated to draw like that . You you can't draw anything uh neat .\nIndustrial Designer: Really ?\nMarketing: Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , {vocalsound} yeah , very precise {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Anything you want . Any b b Yeah . L li li\nProject Manager: I if it if it would be perfect following .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green {gap} uh {gap} school board .\nIndustrial Designer: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is uh is {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , mu\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , board , a school board , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I it has {disfmarker} It is useful . Yeah .\nMarketing: It saves time .\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work ,\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I think then it's pretty useful .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then you can save it immediately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , they are now .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: Celebration .\nProject Manager: It is . So , congratulations crew .\nIndustrial Designer: Did you type that ?\nUser Interface: Hmm . Celebration . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Se {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our {vocalsound} newly earned money . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Finally my beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map .\nUser Interface: But Nils you've got some work left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what you have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: Map , is it a good word ? The folder , yeah .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I have to go to a physiotherapy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh it worked . Two times quick . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Wow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So it is useful , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} It is handy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} This is nice .\nIndustrial Designer: No but uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh great , man .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .\nIndustrial Designer: Radical . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: D design .\nIndustrial Designer: Do you believe it yourself ?\nProject Manager: S Oh . He saved them all ten . Well alright . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well they they wanted everything we produced , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} My big bird . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Your big beautiful bird .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where is this {gap} ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of or the other way around uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you are broken .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I think so too .\nUser Interface: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know . I think she's listening . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I also think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Who is she you're talking about ?\nProject Manager: She already knows . She ? Big brother .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach .\nProject Manager: Our manager .\nIndustrial Designer: Is she also our accountant ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Close your laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Because then we have to confront her with our {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So she can see we're ready .\nMarketing: I feel watched . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics ,\nUser Interface: Yeah . Let's take this remote into uh production .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but we couldn't because of the costs . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That that's the title of our uh end document .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: That that's our new slogan .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Blame our accountants .\nMarketing: Do that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's a nice title . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we couldn't , yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Very catching . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I th Yeah .\nMarketing: I'm sure management would like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: She's on the move .\nProject Manager: I'm going to resign after this project anyway , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the Project Manager's perspective on the prototype.\nAnswer:", "input": "Summarize the Project Manager's perspective on the prototype.", "context": "Project Manager: Uh fourth meeting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We have to do what ?\nProject Manager: Some extra deciding .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} W what ? Alri alright . We'll see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: And the video button . The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .\nProject Manager: Well if I look at it , the side the side view {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , at the back {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then you can add suggestions .\nProject Manager: Oh yeah alright . Yeah {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I I don't want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ?\nUser Interface: No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the back . Yeah . {vocalsound} We thought about {disfmarker} Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . {vocalsound} And we thought about the logo big in the middle .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe that's too much\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way .\nUser Interface: No I don't think {disfmarker} And the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: That's basically what we were thinking about ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: W\nUser Interface: And about the side view um {disfmarker} This the front won't be as thick ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I see , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course ,\nProject Manager: Well . Yeah I see it .\nIndustrial Designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .\nUser Interface: Well , it won't be visible . Mm ?\nProject Manager: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Why ? {vocalsound} Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mean uh the the the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: {gap} If y {vocalsound} If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} In the middle in the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: You you have it a bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .\nProject Manager: And how large is it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , that's the question .\nIndustrial Designer: That's the question .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well {disfmarker} Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? {gap} This was Mike's prototype ,\nProject Manager: Well uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it .\nProject Manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: But now you have a totally different {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well , they lay there all the time .\nIndustrial Designer: The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They the the the the the side view ,\nIndustrial Designer: Side ? Uh oh the side ?\nProject Manager: we didn't uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we we he drew the s the side ,\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But you you hold it like this .\nUser Interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it ,\nIndustrial Designer: You're not holding it like this or something .\nUser Interface: you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this .\nProject Manager: No no no .\nIndustrial Designer: You have it more like this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way .\nMarketing: Like you're holding your telephone .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .\nUser Interface: Hmm . That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree on this .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No but but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree\nProject Manager: Yeah well\nUser Interface: and only Nils {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .\nUser Interface: But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . So uh I c I c\nIndustrial Designer: If necessary .\nProject Manager: Well , we'll we we'll do it like this .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable .\nProject Manager: No {disfmarker} No ,\nIndustrial Designer: But do you\nProject Manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} In the market uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think .\nProject Manager: No not totally .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Not totally , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh {vocalsound} every everyone into account . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: And you might be uh {disfmarker} You might be target customer .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't know .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we don't know ,\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe a thousand people ,\nProject Manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research .\nIndustrial Designer: or a million people .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Let it be .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . So that's that .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh any other suggestions ?\nProject Manager: No , I think it's great .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But what about the redesigning ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Comes to that later .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um you . Uh c You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Walter . {vocalsound} You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You're very personal again .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Great .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's more useful than just {vocalsound} speaking .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , this is just a short intro .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this .\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I know , but {vocalsound} I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire .\nProject Manager: To the customers ?\nIndustrial Designer: So and we ha we have answer now ?\nProject Manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , but I can't can s\nProject Manager: Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: But um {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but uh , you know {disfmarker} We dis we di {vocalsound} we designed it to be perfect .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we {vocalsound} we know where we stand .\nProject Manager: Well , one .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten .\nProject Manager: Well so it's point four . Easy to find t\nIndustrial Designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right , so {disfmarker} Right . Uh is it good-looking ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well , I guess uh I think uh {vocalsound} it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . {gap}\nProject Manager: Two . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um {vocalsound} uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: The titanium might be uh f for older people .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It you put uh put a black front on it or something .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh no . {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also {disfmarker} Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and not only for youth uh young people .\nUser Interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . I totally agree .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , the fourteen yeah .\nProject Manager: We we have to get get on , go through this .\nMarketing: Right , a number please .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so .\nMarketing: So the last one is seven .\nUser Interface: Um , no it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Easy to change channels ?\nProject Manager: No , not false . It's one .\nMarketing: Oh , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nProject Manager: Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it {gap} .\nMarketing: Change channels ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: So I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . You {disfmarker} How can you make it any easier ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} With two huge buttons .\nMarketing: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , huge is a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nMarketing: Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?\nProject Manager: Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s\nUser Interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well six then . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: because of the colour . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Six ? Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so ,\nProject Manager: Are the functions easy to learn ?\nIndustrial Designer: but um um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} We have so few functions , so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nUser Interface: Well , I should {disfmarker} I think two ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: because {vocalsound} the voice recorder is n not self learning . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Alright . Two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , but just do some {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} We we {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I th I th I think this is too time consuming .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we take too much time ?\nProject Manager: Uh not not towards you ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: but towards this all .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Th this is {gap} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: We you have to put it to the customers .\nMarketing: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? {vocalsound} R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nProject Manager: Uh well well a bit , so four .\nMarketing: Four . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , very much . One .\nProject Manager: One . And features included also one . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Device fancy feeling .\nIndustrial Designer: And I think fancy-feeling too ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , cool man .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the titanium back . Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's great .\nProject Manager: Is the device easy to use ?\nUser Interface: The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes we have {vocalsound} not many buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: So well maybe two\nProject Manager: Two , three .\nUser Interface: Two {vocalsound} two .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the voice recorder .\nMarketing: Well , with the uh {disfmarker} Three .\nProject Manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?\nUser Interface: T\nIndustrial Designer: F\nProject Manager: Well in our covers , in our fronts .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So yes , one .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . One or two . Yeah .\nUser Interface: One or two , another two .\nMarketing: Nah f four I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Four ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} If you look at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Oh okay . Okay {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well three .\nMarketing: Three , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can also have {gap} front with uh with fruit on it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , that's true .\nProject Manager: Is the material attractive ?\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: This is the last meeting ?\nProject Manager: Yes , but we we have to design much more ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: The average will uh come later .\nProject Manager: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly .\nProject Manager: Oh . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point .\nIndustrial Designer: My god .\nProject Manager: I had to fit it in .\nMarketing: It has to go to twelve , right ?\nProject Manager: I twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four .\nIndustrial Designer: The what ?\nProject Manager: The sample speaker ,\nIndustrial Designer: The {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Out .\nProject Manager: the s sensor .\nMarketing: That's easy . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: Kick it out .\nUser Interface: The what ?\nProject Manager: We have to go to twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Yeah . The speaker .\nProject Manager: The speaker costs far , by far the most .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option .\nMarketing: That's some wrong info , man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It it isn't worth it .\nIndustrial Designer: No . No , d th No .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: We could make two different versions , one with and one without .\nMarketing: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But for this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's just extra . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: So , zero .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we go to fourteen point six .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually .\nMarketing: What more ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Batteries are uh quite {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh no , no no no .\nProject Manager: w a remote control has a battery .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think .\nUser Interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nMarketing: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Can't we do that with a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: Why not ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh that uh y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: because my information says it .\nProject Manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yeah . Regular is normal .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And simple ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Simple .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nothing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Elementary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Your part .\nIndustrial Designer: I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report .\nProject Manager: What happens if we do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Single {disfmarker} Well you have to use a chip . So {disfmarker} Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: How much do we win ? One .\nUser Interface: We we we {disfmarker} Why ?\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: We have very little options furthermore , for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface: Uh well we have to put that in .\nMarketing: Yeah , we need to have the {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: That that's a fact . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there ,\nMarketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but it's only one half .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Nah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it d it doesn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , that's n It's not relevant .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah , you must change the chip uh back .\nProject Manager: then you s then you only have one half left .\nUser Interface: You must change the chip back , Nils .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nMarketing: No , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Then the whole concept is uh\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} we oh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} You can make you can make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: You have to use it .\nMarketing: But if you don't sell\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? No , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Y we don't need both .\nProject Manager: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Says {gap} .\nProject Manager: Says , his {disfmarker} Uh that was in the second meeting , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I I did single curve to {disfmarker} Well you said s double curved ,\nUser Interface: I ?\nProject Manager: uh he ,\nUser Interface: {gap} ?\nProject Manager: because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We can also make it flat .\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} No\nIndustrial Designer: But what what did what do n\nMarketing: no no no .\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What do they mean with the curves ?\nProject Manager: Curved ?\nIndustrial Designer: Is th Is this a curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes , that's curved .\nIndustrial Designer: One curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .\nProject Manager: No , it's one curve .\nIndustrial Designer: It's how you {disfmarker} It's how you look at it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} One curve . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: One curve , simple .\nIndustrial Designer: Well then we have a huge problem I think .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: We have a big financial problem .\nUser Interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy .\nProject Manager: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But {disfmarker} Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah or we could replace it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you if you make it cool to have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: By the way , we also have this one .\nMarketing: Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: Oh , costs nothing . That's nice . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .\nProject Manager: Plastic is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes , but I just got it .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well that's pretty uh l\nUser Interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium ,\nMarketing: That is pretty stupid . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: N not very practical . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: uh titanium-coloured plastic ?\nProject Manager: Who ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You want to dump the titanium ?\nUser Interface: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper .\nProject Manager: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But I'm n I don't agree .\nUser Interface: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again .\nIndustrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .\nUser Interface: Ah no no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same .\nProject Manager: No , I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Well , I do think so .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Y\nProject Manager: Yes . And the feel ,\nUser Interface: {gap} feel .\nProject Manager: and th that it is strong , and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people .\nProject Manager: We still {vocalsound} we had to focus to get more people from the younger group ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but not lose the one {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think the titanium is very important .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then .\nUser Interface: We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think .\nMarketing: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Well what else ?\nUser Interface: No , nothing .\nIndustrial Designer: W I mean uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or you shou {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Amen .\nMarketing: Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Because you have lots of functions {vocalsound} in it too .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well yeah . Alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Why can't I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I agree with that . So we u we use uh {disfmarker} Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic .\nProject Manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back .\nProject Manager: I I'll talk to the managers . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No no no no . W Titanium stays there .\nProject Manager: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah this is good ,\nMarketing: Osl {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but it it's not good enough . {vocalsound} So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .\nProject Manager: Ah those {gap} those account managers , what do th d what do they know ?\nUser Interface: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Come on . Riot . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: What do we {disfmarker} Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes , yes .\nUser Interface: No because we did not know anything about it .\nProject Manager: One and a half Euros . Hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah al alright , yeah .\nMarketing: If you don't have the money , you can't make it .\nIndustrial Designer: But we have to deal with it now . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive .\nProject Manager: So ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So we have to make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: Titanium gone and add plastic .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but then we've got money left .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?\nProject Manager: Well , no it's just uh all plastic .\nIndustrial Designer: No {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well alright . Huh .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh six . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's just free , man .\nIndustrial Designer: A lot of plastic , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Four . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: No two for the to make it clear .\nProject Manager: But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And we still have money left .\nUser Interface: Yeah . W\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do we want , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: I want gold plating .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No no um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah right . I want chrome . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I think uh the case is double curved then .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Because you y have that curve\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have we have to uh fill {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and you have that curve .\nProject Manager: Y Oh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well , th that that is the problem .\nUser Interface: Yeah well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we ha {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: No no no , but th that's not f um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Safe .\nUser Interface: Well y we have curves in all directions .\nIndustrial Designer: Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped ,\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} alright .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so it it can be done . {vocalsound} But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven .\nProject Manager: Finance ?\nUser Interface: I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it .\nProject Manager: Well , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Guys ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We have to dump our titanium ,\nMarketing: Shoot .\nProject Manager: and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Objection .\nUser Interface: Pro project . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project . {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I think it's uh {disfmarker} Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , me too .\nProject Manager: That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason ,\nIndustrial Designer: Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: And uh unrealistic .\nProject Manager: but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .\nUser Interface: Well we we we used our creativity ,\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: but we just had to adapt it to the costs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Which isn't very practical ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nei . Uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but {vocalsound} that's the way .\nProject Manager: Well , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh leadership next .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Terrible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh teamwork ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leadership .\nUser Interface: Leadership ? Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It was very democratic . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh yeah well {vocalsound} I think so also .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But o alright , the teamwork ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess .\nProject Manager: No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Right yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah , think so too .\nProject Manager: Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It was a complete disaster .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} Uh it it it uh it is uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen .\nProject Manager: It's also a It's both the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Or not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard .\nProject Manager: I liked this SMARTboard ,\nIndustrial Designer: That's the digital panel .\nProject Manager: but I hated that one .\nMarketing: This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ?\nProject Manager: Well it's both a SMARTboard .\nIndustrial Designer: That's that's the smart\nMarketing: Yeah right . B but you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh they're both SMARTboards . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: This is just a large t large television .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A televi Yeah .\nMarketing: You u you use the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .\nMarketing: Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , wi w which one did you like ?\nUser Interface: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Left or right ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That one isn't accurate . {vocalsound} It just doesn't work .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .\nMarketing: You can {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes . Th that is so .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I didn't use uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the {vocalsound} these th\nProject Manager: We're now talking about the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't need a SMARTboard .\nUser Interface: {gap} Well we we used that one ,\nIndustrial Designer: Nei It it's much m {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we needed it . I think .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an {disfmarker} I I like it .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay , alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh you can uh {disfmarker} I I sent it about three times now . Uh {vocalsound} a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah , it is .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The simple uh sch school board .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I agree .\nProject Manager: And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ?\nIndustrial Designer: I I didn't use it .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop .\nProject Manager: I used it uh just to check it out , but uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself ,\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} It isn't practical . Right .\nProject Manager: and then you're going to send it , yeah . Well , no .\nIndustrial Designer: W {vocalsound} But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block .\nMarketing: Your notepad . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's , no , it it's useless .\nUser Interface: Well I I drew this . {gap} Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah alright . For drawings ,\nProject Manager: For drawings , yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: but not for personal notes . I think that's not very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} N notes mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I mean {vocalsound} you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: If you've {disfmarker} If you've {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict {disfmarker} Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I understand .\nMarketing: That Stefan use .\nIndustrial Designer: But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . {vocalsound} You can't {disfmarker} It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . It's it's only useful if you have to draw something .\nUser Interface: Yeah . But then uh it's really useful , I think .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep . Alright . Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mu Yeah right .\nProject Manager: Of course great .\nMarketing: Yeah , great . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Can we keep them ? Uh .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: B by my {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wireless uh wireless things .\nUser Interface: Thanks Project Manager . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Other uh things we used here ? I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well these chairs , man . {vocalsound} Really great .\nIndustrial Designer: Well did you really uh {disfmarker} Did you really take uh take those in account ? {vocalsound} I {vocalsound} half of time I didn't notice they were there . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No . I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . {vocalsound} I don't care about it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we shouldn't talk about that .\nUser Interface: Well I did .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Because {vocalsound} this is a realistic environment .\nProject Manager: Well w why not ? Uh etcetera {gap} {disfmarker} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} N new ideas found ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule {vocalsound} {disfmarker} What ? {vocalsound} For future um meetings {vocalsound} you have got ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I missed uh the option to uh to email ,\nMarketing: Communicate in between .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: Chatting and emailing .\nUser Interface: Email or chat or something .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , right . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but that's one n new idea . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: Well , new ideas found by this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Not . Nothing .\nMarketing: Well , more more information in the beginning .\nProject Manager: We don't want this . We hate this .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Digital pen is useless . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No it isn't .\nProject Manager: Yeah , for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . So it isn't useless .\nProject Manager: But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker} No {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's still an expensive uh expensive {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Because this is huge\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: uh this v very very uh expensive paper .\nUser Interface: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: With the mouse it is {disfmarker} No . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: But if w Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Well and if {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching .\nUser Interface: Uh indeed .\nIndustrial Designer: And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? {vocalsound} A\nProject Manager: Well no . I hated to draw like that . You you can't draw anything uh neat .\nIndustrial Designer: Really ?\nMarketing: Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , {vocalsound} yeah , very precise {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Anything you want . Any b b Yeah . L li li\nProject Manager: I if it if it would be perfect following .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green {gap} uh {gap} school board .\nIndustrial Designer: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is uh is {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , mu\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , board , a school board , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I it has {disfmarker} It is useful . Yeah .\nMarketing: It saves time .\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work ,\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I think then it's pretty useful .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then you can save it immediately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , they are now .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: Celebration .\nProject Manager: It is . So , congratulations crew .\nIndustrial Designer: Did you type that ?\nUser Interface: Hmm . Celebration . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Se {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our {vocalsound} newly earned money . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Finally my beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map .\nUser Interface: But Nils you've got some work left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what you have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: Map , is it a good word ? The folder , yeah .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I have to go to a physiotherapy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh it worked . Two times quick . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Wow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So it is useful , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} It is handy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} This is nice .\nIndustrial Designer: No but uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh great , man .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .\nIndustrial Designer: Radical . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: D design .\nIndustrial Designer: Do you believe it yourself ?\nProject Manager: S Oh . He saved them all ten . Well alright . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well they they wanted everything we produced , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} My big bird . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Your big beautiful bird .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where is this {gap} ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of or the other way around uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you are broken .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I think so too .\nUser Interface: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know . I think she's listening . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I also think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Who is she you're talking about ?\nProject Manager: She already knows . She ? Big brother .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach .\nProject Manager: Our manager .\nIndustrial Designer: Is she also our accountant ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Close your laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Because then we have to confront her with our {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So she can see we're ready .\nMarketing: I feel watched . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad B: \nGrad D: How many batteries do you go through ?\nGrad B: Thank you .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: Sure .\nProfessor C: Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done .\nGrad E: Yeah , I think so too . Um . The {disfmarker} we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . \" It actually says , \" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So uh ,\nProfessor C: It doesn't know \" I \" .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: Um , the uh\nGrad B: Oh , Am Spartacus . \"\nGrad D: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it 's saying .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad B: Verstehe . OK .\nGrad D: I gue\nGrad E: The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this {disfmarker} uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some {disfmarker} some sentences . No , right ?\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , for a couple {disfmarker}\nGrad D: So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a {disfmarker} er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like {disfmarker} the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a {disfmarker} basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so it just starts {disfmarker} uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .\nGrad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the {disfmarker} the syntax trees for three or four .\nGrad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the {disfmarker} from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , \" noun goes to \" , you know , Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .\nGrad B: OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright .\nGrad E: And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we {disfmarker} we worked around that . The , uh {disfmarker} the system , um {disfmarker} I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was {disfmarker} It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .\nGrad D: Why {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in {disfmarker} in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,\nGrad E: You have to switch it on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \" , when I build the {disfmarker} built the tree .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: Like .\nProfessor C: So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: um\nGrad B: I {disfmarker} I still don't {disfmarker} I still don't really understand e like {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Well Tilman s\nGrad B: I mean we sort of say , um {disfmarker} You know , I {disfmarker} I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in {disfmarker} in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user , and then magically it sort of s\nProfessor C: Yeah {disfmarker}\nGrad B: I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ?\nProfessor C: I thi Yeah . So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group ,\nGrad B: R uh Sure .\nProfessor C: but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it .\nGrad B: Yeah , soon . OK .\nProfessor C: And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together .\nGrad B: That 's fine .\nProfessor C: It 's eee {comment} messy but once you understand it you understand it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} There 's nothing really complicated about it .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: No .\nGrad B: And I remember one thing that {disfmarker} that came up in the talk last Wednesday . Um , was this , I {disfmarker} I think he talked about the idea of like , um {disfmarker} He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of {disfmarker} for each word you , um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK , you know how to do it ?\nGrad B: For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . That 's , you know , that 's {disfmarker} that 's HPSG or whatever .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Now , we 're {disfmarker} we 're not committed for our research to {pause} do any of those things .\nGrad B: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So uh we are committed for our funding .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: OK ? to {pause} uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Make our stuff fit to that .\nProfessor C: Yeah , to {disfmarker} n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need .\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: OK ? So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great .\nGrad D: You should probably move the microphone closer to your face .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts\nGrad D: There 's like a little {disfmarker} The twisty thing , you can move it with .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and , s deliberately . So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . It 's just for closure . So that if we come up with a question of \" could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? \" or something . You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us we just need to really understand what 's there . Is there anything we can make use of ? Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ? But none of that has a short time fuse .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something . And then {disfmarker} So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement .\nGrad B: Oh OK .\nProfessor C: That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: but it means we can not think about it for six months .\nGrad B: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: So . The plan for this summer uh , really is to step back from the applied project ,\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor C: keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues .\nGrad B: Hmm . Oh OK .\nProfessor C: And , so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation . But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other {disfmarker} anything lik any other constraints for the time being .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK . Got it .\nProfessor C: It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then {disfmarker} and get the constructions in their form and stuff .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: And , I don I don't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints .\nGrad B: Right , OK .\nProfessor C: Um . And similarly with the parsing , uh we 're gonna worry about parsing uh , the general case you know , construction parser for general constructions . And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well .\nGrad B: So I mean , the {disfmarker} the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been {disfmarker} sort of been geared towards this demo ,\nProfessor C: Right . Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad B: and then that 's going to go away pretty soon .\nProfessor C: But {disfmarker} but we we 're swit\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: huh ?\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's got . What I {disfmarker} what I think is {disfmarker} is a good idea that I can {disfmarker} can show to anyone who 's interested , we can even make a {disfmarker} sort of an internal demo , and I {disfmarker} I show you what I do ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I speak into it and you hear it talk ,\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: and I can sort of walk f through the information . So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes . Just fun .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And so you {disfmarker} when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ? Just give a talk in the big room , and {disfmarker} and so peo people know what 's going on ? when you 're ready ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing {disfmarker} That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say \" this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it \" and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK . Well d we {disfmarker} we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: Indeed .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . Makes sense .\nProfessor C: But any so that {disfmarker} e e It 's clear , then , I think . Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where {disfmarker} Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . Now before we do that , let 's get back in {disfmarker} Oh ! But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can {disfmarker} can see what {disfmarker} what it is that {disfmarker} that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK , right .\nProfessor C: And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the {disfmarker} looked at the SmartKom stuff .\nGrad D: Wa uh {disfmarker} To some de uh what {disfmarker} what part of th the SmartKom stuff ?\nProfessor C: Well , the parser , and that stuff .\nGrad D: Oh yeah {disfmarker} yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . Anyway . So , the trip {disfmarker} the report on these {disfmarker} the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week .\nGrad B: Yeah . It 's alright .\nGrad E: Um . {vocalsound} Well it was just amazing to {disfmarker} to see uh how {disfmarker} how instable the whole thing is ,\nProfessor C: Maybe you 're done , then .\nGrad E: and if you just take the {disfmarker} And I g I got the feeling that we are {pause} the only ones right now who have a running system . I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version {disfmarker} that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . And so it 's {disfmarker} And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said \" yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version \" . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , the system {disfmarker} the integration group . And it was , uh {disfmarker} It was fun to some extent , but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman {disfmarker} um , I know that they enjoyed it here , and they r they {disfmarker} they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , what {disfmarker} what we have been thinking about , and they 're more than willing to {disfmarker} to um , cooperate , by all means . And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal \" group - ware \" server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and {disfmarker} and generating and constructions w we {disfmarker} we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . And um , the , uh {disfmarker} If I find someone at {disfmarker} in EML that is interested in that , um I {disfmarker} I may even think that we could look {disfmarker} take constructions and {disfmarker} and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that {disfmarker} that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline .\nProfessor C: Anyth - any other {vocalsound} {comment} uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? uh we {disfmarker} so we now know I think , what the landscape is like .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And so we just push on and {disfmarker} and uh , do what we need to do . And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight {disfmarker} tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So . Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions . OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? That is {disfmarker} {comment} So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . Yeah {comment} we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't . So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be uh , \" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do \" . And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks . So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh {disfmarker} hopefully a belief - net that does these things . And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual semantics . OK ? What all {disfmarker} you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate . So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out . Is {disfmarker} is that right ? I mean that 's {disfmarker} that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad G: So , I guess , um {disfmarker} Is there like a latest version of the belief - net {disfmarker} of the proposed belief - net ? Like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: We had um decided {disfmarker}\nGrad G: like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Well , no , we didn't decide . We wanted to look into maybe getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer , but I think if we do it , um , sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them , that should suffice .\nGrad G: Mm - hmm . Yeah , that should be fine .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem .\nGrad D: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: That 's separable , yeah .\nGrad D: I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag\nProfessor C: Yep . Right .\nGrad D: JavaBayes does not support that . I can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that . It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it ,\nProfessor C: Not {disfmarker} not at this point .\nGrad D: and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad D: and I couldn't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and , with this thing that we want .\nProfessor C: Well , we can p If it 's {disfmarker} If we can pay {disfmarker} Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that . OK ? So {disfmarker} so don't view free as {disfmarker} as a absolute constraint .\nGrad D: OK . OK , so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK . And you can ask Kevin .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , the one that uh people seem to use is uh Hugin or whatever ?\nProfessor C: Hugin , yeah that 's free .\nGrad G: How exp I don't think it 's {disfmarker} Is it free ? Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I {disfmarker} it seems to {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh , it may be free to academics . Like I {disfmarker} I don't know . I have a co {comment} I have a copy {comment} that I l I downloaded .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: So , at one point it was free .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um ,\nGrad D: How do you spell that ?\nProfessor C: HUGIN .\nGrad F: Why\nProfessor C: And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . So then , in any case , um {disfmarker} But paying a lit You know , if i if it 's uh {disfmarker} Probably for university , it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be real cheap anyway . But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it . I 'm mean , we have no need for that .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in changing the {disfmarker} the JavaBayes code .\nProfessor C: No ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: he 's not gonna do that .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that , it 's sort of a fish - eye . You {disfmarker} you have a node , and you click on it , and it shows you all the connections ,\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle . And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two . If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we {disfmarker} we need to solve right now . What I 'm {disfmarker} what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of {disfmarker} of the internal structure . Maybe node by node , or something like this ? Or should I collect it all\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Doesn't matter .\nGrad G: Um , just any like {disfmarker} like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best .\nGrad E: OK . And um you 're gonna be around ? t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? As usual ? Or will that change ?\nGrad G: Yeah {disfmarker} I mean , yeah , I can {disfmarker} like I c Um . This week I guess um , kind of {disfmarker} I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . So yes , I might {disfmarker} I can be around . And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: Yeah and this is not a crisis that {disfmarker} I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and then we 'll dig {disfmarker} d dig down on this .\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker} Yeah . OK . No , that 's good . That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it . So .\nGrad G: OK .\nGrad B: How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff . Right ? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Right . Well there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there There 're two different things you do .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: One is you design and the other is you learn . OK ? So uh what we 're gonna do initially is {disfmarker} is do design , and , i if you will , guess .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of {disfmarker} of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: If it 's done right , and if you have data then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although that takes a lot more data , and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . So uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it .\nGrad B: Alright .\nGrad E: Yeah . Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So but this is the {pause} {vocalsound} {comment} {pause} long run .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning .\nGrad B: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there I could swore {disfmarker} uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a {disfmarker} um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the {disfmarker} with the system ? Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to {disfmarker} to look at what {disfmarker} look at the stuff , and see what people are saying .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah make yourself a note . So and {disfmarker} and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , so whatever you guys can get .\nGrad E: The German . Oh yeah , of course , German . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , the y your native language , right ? You remember that one .\nGrad E: OK . That 's important , yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: So he 'll get you some data .\nGrad B: u OK . Yeah , I mean I {disfmarker} I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nGrad B: It was just {disfmarker} Strange , but .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad E: We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs .\nGrad B: Oh yeah , OK .\nGrad E: Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already .\nGrad B: OK , yeah , I mean .\nGrad E: So . {disfmarker} Transcribed . I will send you that . OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that we oughta talk about today ?\nGrad E: Ho - how was your thingy .\nGrad B: Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff ,\nProfessor C: Oh right .\nGrad B: and that was pretty interesting and you know , I mean , seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh {disfmarker} to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know , \" What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , \" or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . So , um , now that was {disfmarker} the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction {disfmarker} he 'd {disfmarker} what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , \" your bike is parked across the street \" and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , \" well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike \" , but um in {disfmarker} in Japanese the {disfmarker} the more conventionalized tendency is to use a {disfmarker} sort of a description of \" where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree \" . Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , \" there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river \" , or something like that . So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . But um {disfmarker} But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like \" right where you start to go up the hill \" , or \" just when you get off the train \" , or something like that to {disfmarker} uh , to indicate where something is .\nProfessor C: Mmm .\nGrad B: So we 'll have to think about {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: So {disfmarker} how much is that used in German ?\nGrad E: Um . The uh {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} I wa I was on a uh {disfmarker} on a {disfmarker} on a different sidetrack .\nProfessor C: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: I mean , the {disfmarker} the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at {disfmarker} at the moment , but this is a {disfmarker} a three language project : German , English , Japanese .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , we have a uh , uh {disfmarker} I have taken care that we have the {disfmarker} the Japanese generation and stuff . And so I looked into uh spatial description . So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . And {disfmarker} and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh {disfmarker} differences in spatial descriptions . Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , so how {disfmarker} how , I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So . Um .\nProfessor C: So , where is this huge project ?\nGrad E: It 's KLEIST . It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: \nProfessor C: Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: But um , I {disfmarker} I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for {disfmarker} for now ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: but um definitely it 's interesting to look at {disfmarker} at cross the bordered there .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Are {disfmarker} are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the direction relative {disfmarker} relative to the speaker ? For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English . We can say um \" park in front of the car \" as you come beh you drive behind the car . In Hebrew it means \" park behind the car \" , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Intrinsic , yeah .\nPhD A: While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So .\nGrad B: Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So , i i i is German uh closer to {disfmarker} to E uh , uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} to E I mean uh\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I don't think it {disfmarker} it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different .\nGrad E: Um , as a matter of fact {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: No , it 's not .\nGrad B: Right .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Um . Did you ever get to look at the {disfmarker} the rou paper that I sent you on the {disfmarker} on that problem in English and German ?\nGrad B: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Carroll , ninety - three . Um . I {disfmarker} There is a {disfmarker} a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad E: So it 's {disfmarker} they actually say \" the monkey in front of the car , where 's the monkey ? \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that {disfmarker} that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors .\nPhD A: That {disfmarker} but it wasn't {disfmarker} was {disfmarker}\nGrad E: That syntactic facto factors do {disfmarker} do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames .\nPhD A: Right . Mm - hmm . Right .\nGrad B: I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in {disfmarker} in English depending o\nProfessor C: Hmm .\nGrad B: You know , like , \" in front of the car \" could you know {disfmarker} Like , here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . I could see that ,\nProfessor C: Absolutely .\nGrad B: but {disfmarker} But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was {disfmarker} this was a {disfmarker} a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . So uh .\nGrad E: I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the {disfmarker} the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames .\nGrad B: Alright ! Cool !\nGrad E: So .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: Not really .\nProfessor C: Great . No , I 've not seen that .\nPhD A: What do you mean . Um . \" reference frames \" ?\nGrad E: It 's called a {disfmarker}\nPhD A: uh uh\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker} it 's spatial reference frames . You actually have only {disfmarker} Um . If you wanna have a {disfmarker} This is usually um {disfmarker} I should {disfmarker} there should be an \" L \" , though . Well actually you have {disfmarker} only have two choices . You can either do a two - point or a three - point which is you You 're familiar with th with the \" origo \" ? where that 's the center {disfmarker} \" Origo \" is the center of the f frame of reference .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: OK ? In some cases the origo is the same as the reference object .\nProfessor C: So that would be \" origin \" in English ,\nGrad F: This was like {disfmarker}\nGrad B: The origin .\nPhD A: Right\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: right ?\nGrad E: \" Origo \" is a Terminus technikus . in that sense , that 's even used in the English literature . \" Origo . \"\nGrad B: Oh , OK . I never heard it .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , so , this video tape is in front of me .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad E: Those are two - point .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , reference object and {disfmarker} Um . No , from {disfmarker} from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair .\nGrad B: Right . You {disfmarker} you can actually say things like , um , \" it 's behind the tree from me \" or something like that , I think , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in certain circumstances in English , right ? As sort of \" from where I 'm standing it would appear that \" {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . Yeah . So ,\nGrad F: Looks a little bit like Reichenbach for time .\nProfessor C: Yeah , it sounds like it , doesn't it ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a lot like it .\nGrad E: And then {disfmarker} and then here you {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Um .\nGrad E: On this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And that 's {comment} {disfmarker} that 's basically it . So . Egocentric two - point , egocentric three - point , or you can have allocentric .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: So , \" as seen from the church , the town hall is right of that um , fire station \" . aa - huh {comment} It 's hardly ever used but it 's w\nPhD A: I 'd love to see it if you {disfmarker} if you have a copy kind of . Uh .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . I see this is {disfmarker} this is getting into Ami 's thing .\nPhD A: Here\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: He 's {disfmarker} he 's very interested in that .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: So .\nGrad B: Me too .\nProfessor C: Uh . Yeah . Well , why don't you just put it on the web page ? There 's this EDU {disfmarker} Right ?\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or just {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor C: Or a link to it .\nGrad E: It 's also all on my {disfmarker} my home page at EML . It 's called \" An Anatomy of a Spatial Description \" .\nProfessor C: Just\nGrad E: But I 'll send that link .\nPhD A: OK , great .\nProfessor C: Maybe just put a link on . Yeah .\nGrad E: Yep .\nProfessor C: By the way , there {disfmarker} something that I didn't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .\nGrad E: Yep .\nGrad B: Huh .\nProfessor C: So there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know , near and far , or yon and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So this is all {disfmarker} This is {disfmarker} There 's this linguistic facts . But apparently , the {disfmarker} Uh . Here 's the way the findings go . That , you know they do MRI , and {disfmarker} and if you 're uh {disfmarker} got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up , and if something 's out of reach uh a different one . But here 's the {disfmarker} the amazing result , um , they say . You get someone with a {disfmarker} with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . So the s typical task is subdivision . So there 's a {disfmarker} a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , \" Where 's the midpoint ? \" And they do fine . If you give them the line , and they have to touch it , they can't . There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that . Here 's the real experiment . The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , \" where is it ? \" ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: they do it . Give them a stick , long stick , and say \" do it \" , they can't do it . So there 's a remapping of distant space into nearby space .\nPhD A: Right . So they doubled {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the end {disfmarker} the end of this {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Because it 's within reach now ?\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach uh , mechanism .\nGrad B: yeah .\nGrad F: Oh . Wow .\nGrad B: Circuits .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And so this doe This is , uh {disfmarker} First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about and I 'll do this {disfmarker} this test on you guys as well . So . Uh . How - I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , I start feeling the tip directly . Not indirectly , but you actually can feel the tip .\nGrad B: Yeah yeah .\nProfessor C: And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of , physical sensation , of the end affector .\nGrad B: Yeah . What 's going on at the end of the tool ,\nPhD A: The ext the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} The extension ,\nGrad B: yeah .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nGrad B: What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever .\nProfessor C: Yeah , within {disfmarker}\nPhD A: right .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nPhD A: The extension of {disfmarker} of your hand , right .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right . Have you hav y h had this ?\nPhD A: The {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think so . I mean i i it 's not exactly the th same thing , but {disfmarker} but s it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's getting close to that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad F: W what does it feel like ?\nProfessor C: Oh i it feels like your {disfmarker} as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth and {disfmarker} and you deal directly with it .\nPhD A: I once {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ? So you can insert your hand something\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nProfessor C: Right , yeah {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: and there 's a correspondence between {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So I played with it . After a while , you don't feel the difference anymore . I {disfmarker} I mean it 's kind of {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right .\nPhD A: Very {disfmarker} kind of {disfmarker} you stop back and suddenly it goes away and you have to kind of work again to recapture it , but yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Right , Yeah , so anyway , so {disfmarker} So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh , make this distinction . Of course there are behavioral differences too . Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference . And i this is , um {disfmarker} So . In addition to the e\nGrad E: This is more proximal - distal .\nProfessor C: Yeah uh exactly . So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded . S\nGrad E: Well , Dan Montello sort of , he {disfmarker} he does the uh uh {disfmarker} th the cognitive map world , down in Santa Barbara . And he {disfmarker} he always talks about these {disfmarker} He {disfmarker} he already {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} i probably most likely without knowing this {disfmarker} this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Well there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw . Anyway yeah , so we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll look at this . And . So , all of these issues now {disfmarker} are now starting to come up . So , now {disfmarker} we 're now done with demos . We 're starting to do science , right ? And so these issues about uh , reference , and {disfmarker} spatial {comment} reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh {comment} all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: um {disfmarker} So , all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now . So we gotta do all this . So there 's that . And then there 's also a set of system things that come up . So \" OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Right ?\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: It {disfmarker} it follows . And so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gonna build something and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is , and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the um , the grammar stuff .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology , so , um {disfmarker} And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on uh , \" is there an ontology API that {disfmarker} that \" {disfmarker} There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we build the parser and stuff around that , or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so {disfmarker} For example , is there something that we can use there . i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML have something that we can just p pull out , for that . Uh , so there are gonna be some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some things like that , which are not science but system . But we aren't gonna ignore those cuz we 're {disfmarker} we 're not only going {disfmarker} The plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . And how much we build , and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . So . It 's always been out of phase but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that . So we 've talked about it , and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing ,\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: It was just this uh construction analyzer . And so we think {disfmarker} we think we have a shot at {disfmarker} at that .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So . The for So . To {disfmarker} to come full circle on that , this formalization task , OK ? is trying to get the formalism into {disfmarker} into a shape where it can actually uh\nGrad B: Yeah . Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , right ?\nProfessor C: d Well , yeah , where it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} covers the whole range of things . And the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms . It turned out , inherently not to cover the space .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And it just {disfmarker} it was just terribly frustrating for him ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing .\nGrad B: I see . Right .\nProfessor C: And . Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .\nGrad B: OK . Good to know .\nProfessor C: Uh . Huh ? Is {disfmarker} This is true , is it not ?\nGrad D: Yes .\nProfessor C: OK . So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad F: You don't have a hidden purist streak ?\nGrad D: Oh no .\nProfessor C: We - well it hasn't it {disfmarker} it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case .\nGrad F: OK . Just checking .\nGrad D: No sir .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK . Uh . So . For {disfmarker} for {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Cuz I don't have to implement anything .\nProfessor C: Exactly right . Exactly .\nGrad F: I have a problem , then . It 's {disfmarker} So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad B: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: Right . Why {disfmarker} a actually , uh , the thing is , you {disfmarker} you do but , th the thing you have to im implement is so small that {disfmarker} Uh .\nGrad F: Which meeting I 'm in . It 's OK to be purist within that context .\nProfessor C: Within that , yeah ,\nGrad F: Yes ,\nProfessor C: and uh , it 's {disfmarker} a and still , I think , you know , get something done .\nGrad F: good .\nGrad B: Cool !\nProfessor C: But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if {disfmarker} if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , {vocalsound} is real hard .\nGrad F: Yay .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space ,\nPhD A: It 's possible yeah .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , uh , for his absentee thesis . I think you all know that {disfmarker} that you can just , in Germany {disfmarker} almost just send in your thesis .\nGrad B: Just a drive up . Ca - chuk !\nPhD A: Um\nProfessor C: Yeah right .\nGrad B: There you go .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad E: The - th There {disfmarker} there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh {vocalsound} joint over in Saarbruecken .\nGrad B: Exactly . Drive through , yeah .\nProfessor C: It costs a lot . The {disfmarker} the amount {disfmarker} You put in your credit card and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as well . But , uh , {disfmarker} But anyway , so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , so that {disfmarker} that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into . And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So , de Uh . And her name is Eva .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: It really is . Nobody believed th th that {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah , I thought it had to be a joke , of your part , you know\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad F: like {disfmarker} {comment} \" Johno made it up , I 'm sure . \"\nGrad G: Is this person someone who 's in first - year this year ,\nProfessor C: No , first year coming .\nGrad G: or\nProfessor C: So , she 's {disfmarker} she 's now out here she 's moved , and she 'll be a student as of then .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh .\nGrad E: Document .\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor C: Uh , against all traditions . And actually I talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . Uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Someone from the class ?\nProfessor C: No , interestingly enough .\nGrad F: We always get these people who are not in the class , who {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Some of th some of them , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's interesting .\nProfessor C: So anyway , uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Uh , so , um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read . So we 'll see how this goes . Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first {disfmarker} {comment} incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , so we 'll see how that goes . Um , anyway , so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , I 'm not sure . It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes . S so , we 'll see . And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape ,\nPhD A: OK .\nProfessor C: so uh and ,\nPhD A: Right\nProfessor C: I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the {disfmarker} your traditional questions in this light , uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be quite happy to uh see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and um , how they might uh get reflected in constructions .\nGrad B: Sure .\nProfessor C: I suspect that 's right .\nGrad B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I may have to go to Switzerland for {disfmarker} in June or beginning of July for between two weeks and four weeks , but uh , after that or before that .\nProfessor C: OK , fine . And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in {disfmarker} in the neighborhood .\nPhD A: Right . Yeah be uh actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yep . E o do y\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , we we 're connected to uh {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a very significant connection between {disfmarker} We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go through this ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh {disfmarker} It 's the {disfmarker} Fr Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes . There 's one in {disfmarker} in Zurich ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: E T and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne ,\nGrad B: Oh , so in Switzerland .\nProfessor C: OK ? which is uh E P\nPhD A: Great .\nProfessor C: F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: Probably we 're connected to them .\nPhD A: Great . I 'll let you know . S I 'll send you email .\nProfessor C: OK . Yeah , and so anyway we c uh {disfmarker} We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Hmm . Uh . I {disfmarker} I think the one you {disfmarker} you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .\nPhD A: Sure , yeah .\nProfessor C: A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so , and {disfmarker} and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .\nPhD A: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor C: And you 'll get feedback from these guys .\nPhD A: Great , yeah .\nProfessor C: Cuz they 've actually {disfmarker} these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . So we 'll set that up .\nPhD A: Cool .\nProfessor C: OK . So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the {disfmarker} uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I tho It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .\nProfessor C: OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying \" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand \" . And that we as a group will try to {disfmarker} to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .\nGrad G: Sure .\nProfessor C: OK ? Uh , \" these are the decisions \" {disfmarker} I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: You know . We {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Does that so make sense ?\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , the {disfmarker} the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ?\nGrad G: No , I {disfmarker} I think I 'll be done {disfmarker} everything by this uh {disfmarker} by the end of this week .\nGrad E: Same with you ? No .\nGrad D: Nnn . This {disfmarker} Well , I 've {disfmarker} I have projects , but then the {disfmarker} my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess .\nGrad G: Hmm .\nProfessor C: Right . Um , But anyway , yeah .\nGrad B: Pretty soon .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so I guess that 's\nGrad D: So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .\nProfessor C: Right . right . So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking , uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: right ? So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So we 'll do that . Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa\nGrad B: Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah .\nProfessor C: We {disfmarker} we want those ,\nGrad B: Yeah , oh yeah .\nProfessor C: right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So let me {disfmarker} let me make a note to do that .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer ,\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Oh right ! Right right right !\nGrad B: so .\nProfessor C: That 's great ! Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: Hi\nGrad B: Right , no faculty !\nProfessor C: Th - the faculty aren't {disfmarker} faculty aren't supposed to know .\nGrad D: Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .\nProfessor C: But um , I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah , right . It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all ,\nGrad D: Bhaskara .\nGrad B: right .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What demos would the system be involved in?\nAnswer:", "input": "What demos would the system be involved in?", "context": "Grad B: \nGrad D: How many batteries do you go through ?\nGrad B: Thank you .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: Sure .\nProfessor C: Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done .\nGrad E: Yeah , I think so too . Um . The {disfmarker} we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . \" It actually says , \" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So uh ,\nProfessor C: It doesn't know \" I \" .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: Um , the uh\nGrad B: Oh , Am Spartacus . \"\nGrad D: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it 's saying .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad B: Verstehe . OK .\nGrad D: I gue\nGrad E: The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this {disfmarker} uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some {disfmarker} some sentences . No , right ?\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , for a couple {disfmarker}\nGrad D: So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a {disfmarker} er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like {disfmarker} the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a {disfmarker} basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so it just starts {disfmarker} uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .\nGrad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the {disfmarker} the syntax trees for three or four .\nGrad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the {disfmarker} from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , \" noun goes to \" , you know , Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .\nGrad B: OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright .\nGrad E: And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we {disfmarker} we worked around that . The , uh {disfmarker} the system , um {disfmarker} I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was {disfmarker} It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .\nGrad D: Why {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in {disfmarker} in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,\nGrad E: You have to switch it on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \" , when I build the {disfmarker} built the tree .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: Like .\nProfessor C: So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: um\nGrad B: I {disfmarker} I still don't {disfmarker} I still don't really understand e like {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Well Tilman s\nGrad B: I mean we sort of say , um {disfmarker} You know , I {disfmarker} I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in {disfmarker} in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user , and then magically it sort of s\nProfessor C: Yeah {disfmarker}\nGrad B: I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ?\nProfessor C: I thi Yeah . So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group ,\nGrad B: R uh Sure .\nProfessor C: but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it .\nGrad B: Yeah , soon . OK .\nProfessor C: And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together .\nGrad B: That 's fine .\nProfessor C: It 's eee {comment} messy but once you understand it you understand it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} There 's nothing really complicated about it .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: No .\nGrad B: And I remember one thing that {disfmarker} that came up in the talk last Wednesday . Um , was this , I {disfmarker} I think he talked about the idea of like , um {disfmarker} He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of {disfmarker} for each word you , um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK , you know how to do it ?\nGrad B: For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . That 's , you know , that 's {disfmarker} that 's HPSG or whatever .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Now , we 're {disfmarker} we 're not committed for our research to {pause} do any of those things .\nGrad B: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So uh we are committed for our funding .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: OK ? to {pause} uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Make our stuff fit to that .\nProfessor C: Yeah , to {disfmarker} n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need .\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: OK ? So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great .\nGrad D: You should probably move the microphone closer to your face .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts\nGrad D: There 's like a little {disfmarker} The twisty thing , you can move it with .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and , s deliberately . So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . It 's just for closure . So that if we come up with a question of \" could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? \" or something . You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us we just need to really understand what 's there . Is there anything we can make use of ? Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ? But none of that has a short time fuse .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something . And then {disfmarker} So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement .\nGrad B: Oh OK .\nProfessor C: That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: but it means we can not think about it for six months .\nGrad B: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: So . The plan for this summer uh , really is to step back from the applied project ,\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor C: keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues .\nGrad B: Hmm . Oh OK .\nProfessor C: And , so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation . But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other {disfmarker} anything lik any other constraints for the time being .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK . Got it .\nProfessor C: It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then {disfmarker} and get the constructions in their form and stuff .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: And , I don I don't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints .\nGrad B: Right , OK .\nProfessor C: Um . And similarly with the parsing , uh we 're gonna worry about parsing uh , the general case you know , construction parser for general constructions . And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well .\nGrad B: So I mean , the {disfmarker} the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been {disfmarker} sort of been geared towards this demo ,\nProfessor C: Right . Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad B: and then that 's going to go away pretty soon .\nProfessor C: But {disfmarker} but we we 're swit\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: huh ?\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's got . What I {disfmarker} what I think is {disfmarker} is a good idea that I can {disfmarker} can show to anyone who 's interested , we can even make a {disfmarker} sort of an internal demo , and I {disfmarker} I show you what I do ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I speak into it and you hear it talk ,\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: and I can sort of walk f through the information . So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes . Just fun .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And so you {disfmarker} when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ? Just give a talk in the big room , and {disfmarker} and so peo people know what 's going on ? when you 're ready ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing {disfmarker} That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say \" this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it \" and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK . Well d we {disfmarker} we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: Indeed .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . Makes sense .\nProfessor C: But any so that {disfmarker} e e It 's clear , then , I think . Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where {disfmarker} Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . Now before we do that , let 's get back in {disfmarker} Oh ! But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can {disfmarker} can see what {disfmarker} what it is that {disfmarker} that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK , right .\nProfessor C: And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the {disfmarker} looked at the SmartKom stuff .\nGrad D: Wa uh {disfmarker} To some de uh what {disfmarker} what part of th the SmartKom stuff ?\nProfessor C: Well , the parser , and that stuff .\nGrad D: Oh yeah {disfmarker} yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . Anyway . So , the trip {disfmarker} the report on these {disfmarker} the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week .\nGrad B: Yeah . It 's alright .\nGrad E: Um . {vocalsound} Well it was just amazing to {disfmarker} to see uh how {disfmarker} how instable the whole thing is ,\nProfessor C: Maybe you 're done , then .\nGrad E: and if you just take the {disfmarker} And I g I got the feeling that we are {pause} the only ones right now who have a running system . I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version {disfmarker} that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . And so it 's {disfmarker} And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said \" yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version \" . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , the system {disfmarker} the integration group . And it was , uh {disfmarker} It was fun to some extent , but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman {disfmarker} um , I know that they enjoyed it here , and they r they {disfmarker} they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , what {disfmarker} what we have been thinking about , and they 're more than willing to {disfmarker} to um , cooperate , by all means . And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal \" group - ware \" server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and {disfmarker} and generating and constructions w we {disfmarker} we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . And um , the , uh {disfmarker} If I find someone at {disfmarker} in EML that is interested in that , um I {disfmarker} I may even think that we could look {disfmarker} take constructions and {disfmarker} and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that {disfmarker} that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline .\nProfessor C: Anyth - any other {vocalsound} {comment} uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? uh we {disfmarker} so we now know I think , what the landscape is like .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And so we just push on and {disfmarker} and uh , do what we need to do . And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight {disfmarker} tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So . Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions . OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? That is {disfmarker} {comment} So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . Yeah {comment} we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't . So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be uh , \" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do \" . And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks . So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh {disfmarker} hopefully a belief - net that does these things . And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual semantics . OK ? What all {disfmarker} you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate . So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out . Is {disfmarker} is that right ? I mean that 's {disfmarker} that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad G: So , I guess , um {disfmarker} Is there like a latest version of the belief - net {disfmarker} of the proposed belief - net ? Like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: We had um decided {disfmarker}\nGrad G: like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Well , no , we didn't decide . We wanted to look into maybe getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer , but I think if we do it , um , sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them , that should suffice .\nGrad G: Mm - hmm . Yeah , that should be fine .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem .\nGrad D: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: That 's separable , yeah .\nGrad D: I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag\nProfessor C: Yep . Right .\nGrad D: JavaBayes does not support that . I can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that . It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it ,\nProfessor C: Not {disfmarker} not at this point .\nGrad D: and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad D: and I couldn't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and , with this thing that we want .\nProfessor C: Well , we can p If it 's {disfmarker} If we can pay {disfmarker} Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that . OK ? So {disfmarker} so don't view free as {disfmarker} as a absolute constraint .\nGrad D: OK . OK , so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK . And you can ask Kevin .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , the one that uh people seem to use is uh Hugin or whatever ?\nProfessor C: Hugin , yeah that 's free .\nGrad G: How exp I don't think it 's {disfmarker} Is it free ? Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I {disfmarker} it seems to {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh , it may be free to academics . Like I {disfmarker} I don't know . I have a co {comment} I have a copy {comment} that I l I downloaded .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: So , at one point it was free .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um ,\nGrad D: How do you spell that ?\nProfessor C: HUGIN .\nGrad F: Why\nProfessor C: And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . So then , in any case , um {disfmarker} But paying a lit You know , if i if it 's uh {disfmarker} Probably for university , it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be real cheap anyway . But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it . I 'm mean , we have no need for that .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in changing the {disfmarker} the JavaBayes code .\nProfessor C: No ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: he 's not gonna do that .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that , it 's sort of a fish - eye . You {disfmarker} you have a node , and you click on it , and it shows you all the connections ,\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle . And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two . If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we {disfmarker} we need to solve right now . What I 'm {disfmarker} what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of {disfmarker} of the internal structure . Maybe node by node , or something like this ? Or should I collect it all\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Doesn't matter .\nGrad G: Um , just any like {disfmarker} like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best .\nGrad E: OK . And um you 're gonna be around ? t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? As usual ? Or will that change ?\nGrad G: Yeah {disfmarker} I mean , yeah , I can {disfmarker} like I c Um . This week I guess um , kind of {disfmarker} I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . So yes , I might {disfmarker} I can be around . And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: Yeah and this is not a crisis that {disfmarker} I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and then we 'll dig {disfmarker} d dig down on this .\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker} Yeah . OK . No , that 's good . That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it . So .\nGrad G: OK .\nGrad B: How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff . Right ? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Right . Well there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there There 're two different things you do .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: One is you design and the other is you learn . OK ? So uh what we 're gonna do initially is {disfmarker} is do design , and , i if you will , guess .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of {disfmarker} of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: If it 's done right , and if you have data then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although that takes a lot more data , and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . So uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it .\nGrad B: Alright .\nGrad E: Yeah . Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So but this is the {pause} {vocalsound} {comment} {pause} long run .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning .\nGrad B: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there I could swore {disfmarker} uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a {disfmarker} um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the {disfmarker} with the system ? Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to {disfmarker} to look at what {disfmarker} look at the stuff , and see what people are saying .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah make yourself a note . So and {disfmarker} and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , so whatever you guys can get .\nGrad E: The German . Oh yeah , of course , German . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , the y your native language , right ? You remember that one .\nGrad E: OK . That 's important , yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: So he 'll get you some data .\nGrad B: u OK . Yeah , I mean I {disfmarker} I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nGrad B: It was just {disfmarker} Strange , but .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad E: We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs .\nGrad B: Oh yeah , OK .\nGrad E: Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already .\nGrad B: OK , yeah , I mean .\nGrad E: So . {disfmarker} Transcribed . I will send you that . OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that we oughta talk about today ?\nGrad E: Ho - how was your thingy .\nGrad B: Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff ,\nProfessor C: Oh right .\nGrad B: and that was pretty interesting and you know , I mean , seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh {disfmarker} to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know , \" What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , \" or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . So , um , now that was {disfmarker} the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction {disfmarker} he 'd {disfmarker} what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , \" your bike is parked across the street \" and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , \" well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike \" , but um in {disfmarker} in Japanese the {disfmarker} the more conventionalized tendency is to use a {disfmarker} sort of a description of \" where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree \" . Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , \" there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river \" , or something like that . So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . But um {disfmarker} But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like \" right where you start to go up the hill \" , or \" just when you get off the train \" , or something like that to {disfmarker} uh , to indicate where something is .\nProfessor C: Mmm .\nGrad B: So we 'll have to think about {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: So {disfmarker} how much is that used in German ?\nGrad E: Um . The uh {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} I wa I was on a uh {disfmarker} on a {disfmarker} on a different sidetrack .\nProfessor C: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: I mean , the {disfmarker} the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at {disfmarker} at the moment , but this is a {disfmarker} a three language project : German , English , Japanese .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , we have a uh , uh {disfmarker} I have taken care that we have the {disfmarker} the Japanese generation and stuff . And so I looked into uh spatial description . So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . And {disfmarker} and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh {disfmarker} differences in spatial descriptions . Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , so how {disfmarker} how , I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So . Um .\nProfessor C: So , where is this huge project ?\nGrad E: It 's KLEIST . It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: \nProfessor C: Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: But um , I {disfmarker} I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for {disfmarker} for now ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: but um definitely it 's interesting to look at {disfmarker} at cross the bordered there .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Are {disfmarker} are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the direction relative {disfmarker} relative to the speaker ? For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English . We can say um \" park in front of the car \" as you come beh you drive behind the car . In Hebrew it means \" park behind the car \" , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Intrinsic , yeah .\nPhD A: While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So .\nGrad B: Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So , i i i is German uh closer to {disfmarker} to E uh , uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} to E I mean uh\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I don't think it {disfmarker} it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different .\nGrad E: Um , as a matter of fact {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: No , it 's not .\nGrad B: Right .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Um . Did you ever get to look at the {disfmarker} the rou paper that I sent you on the {disfmarker} on that problem in English and German ?\nGrad B: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Carroll , ninety - three . Um . I {disfmarker} There is a {disfmarker} a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad E: So it 's {disfmarker} they actually say \" the monkey in front of the car , where 's the monkey ? \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that {disfmarker} that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors .\nPhD A: That {disfmarker} but it wasn't {disfmarker} was {disfmarker}\nGrad E: That syntactic facto factors do {disfmarker} do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames .\nPhD A: Right . Mm - hmm . Right .\nGrad B: I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in {disfmarker} in English depending o\nProfessor C: Hmm .\nGrad B: You know , like , \" in front of the car \" could you know {disfmarker} Like , here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . I could see that ,\nProfessor C: Absolutely .\nGrad B: but {disfmarker} But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was {disfmarker} this was a {disfmarker} a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . So uh .\nGrad E: I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the {disfmarker} the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames .\nGrad B: Alright ! Cool !\nGrad E: So .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: Not really .\nProfessor C: Great . No , I 've not seen that .\nPhD A: What do you mean . Um . \" reference frames \" ?\nGrad E: It 's called a {disfmarker}\nPhD A: uh uh\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker} it 's spatial reference frames . You actually have only {disfmarker} Um . If you wanna have a {disfmarker} This is usually um {disfmarker} I should {disfmarker} there should be an \" L \" , though . Well actually you have {disfmarker} only have two choices . You can either do a two - point or a three - point which is you You 're familiar with th with the \" origo \" ? where that 's the center {disfmarker} \" Origo \" is the center of the f frame of reference .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: OK ? In some cases the origo is the same as the reference object .\nProfessor C: So that would be \" origin \" in English ,\nGrad F: This was like {disfmarker}\nGrad B: The origin .\nPhD A: Right\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: right ?\nGrad E: \" Origo \" is a Terminus technikus . in that sense , that 's even used in the English literature . \" Origo . \"\nGrad B: Oh , OK . I never heard it .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , so , this video tape is in front of me .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad E: Those are two - point .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , reference object and {disfmarker} Um . No , from {disfmarker} from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair .\nGrad B: Right . You {disfmarker} you can actually say things like , um , \" it 's behind the tree from me \" or something like that , I think , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in certain circumstances in English , right ? As sort of \" from where I 'm standing it would appear that \" {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . Yeah . So ,\nGrad F: Looks a little bit like Reichenbach for time .\nProfessor C: Yeah , it sounds like it , doesn't it ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a lot like it .\nGrad E: And then {disfmarker} and then here you {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Um .\nGrad E: On this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And that 's {comment} {disfmarker} that 's basically it . So . Egocentric two - point , egocentric three - point , or you can have allocentric .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: So , \" as seen from the church , the town hall is right of that um , fire station \" . aa - huh {comment} It 's hardly ever used but it 's w\nPhD A: I 'd love to see it if you {disfmarker} if you have a copy kind of . Uh .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . I see this is {disfmarker} this is getting into Ami 's thing .\nPhD A: Here\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: He 's {disfmarker} he 's very interested in that .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: So .\nGrad B: Me too .\nProfessor C: Uh . Yeah . Well , why don't you just put it on the web page ? There 's this EDU {disfmarker} Right ?\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or just {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor C: Or a link to it .\nGrad E: It 's also all on my {disfmarker} my home page at EML . It 's called \" An Anatomy of a Spatial Description \" .\nProfessor C: Just\nGrad E: But I 'll send that link .\nPhD A: OK , great .\nProfessor C: Maybe just put a link on . Yeah .\nGrad E: Yep .\nProfessor C: By the way , there {disfmarker} something that I didn't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .\nGrad E: Yep .\nGrad B: Huh .\nProfessor C: So there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know , near and far , or yon and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So this is all {disfmarker} This is {disfmarker} There 's this linguistic facts . But apparently , the {disfmarker} Uh . Here 's the way the findings go . That , you know they do MRI , and {disfmarker} and if you 're uh {disfmarker} got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up , and if something 's out of reach uh a different one . But here 's the {disfmarker} the amazing result , um , they say . You get someone with a {disfmarker} with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . So the s typical task is subdivision . So there 's a {disfmarker} a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , \" Where 's the midpoint ? \" And they do fine . If you give them the line , and they have to touch it , they can't . There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that . Here 's the real experiment . The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , \" where is it ? \" ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: they do it . Give them a stick , long stick , and say \" do it \" , they can't do it . So there 's a remapping of distant space into nearby space .\nPhD A: Right . So they doubled {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the end {disfmarker} the end of this {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Because it 's within reach now ?\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach uh , mechanism .\nGrad B: yeah .\nGrad F: Oh . Wow .\nGrad B: Circuits .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And so this doe This is , uh {disfmarker} First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about and I 'll do this {disfmarker} this test on you guys as well . So . Uh . How - I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , I start feeling the tip directly . Not indirectly , but you actually can feel the tip .\nGrad B: Yeah yeah .\nProfessor C: And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of , physical sensation , of the end affector .\nGrad B: Yeah . What 's going on at the end of the tool ,\nPhD A: The ext the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} The extension ,\nGrad B: yeah .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nGrad B: What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever .\nProfessor C: Yeah , within {disfmarker}\nPhD A: right .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nPhD A: The extension of {disfmarker} of your hand , right .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right . Have you hav y h had this ?\nPhD A: The {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think so . I mean i i it 's not exactly the th same thing , but {disfmarker} but s it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's getting close to that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad F: W what does it feel like ?\nProfessor C: Oh i it feels like your {disfmarker} as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth and {disfmarker} and you deal directly with it .\nPhD A: I once {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ? So you can insert your hand something\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nProfessor C: Right , yeah {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: and there 's a correspondence between {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So I played with it . After a while , you don't feel the difference anymore . I {disfmarker} I mean it 's kind of {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right .\nPhD A: Very {disfmarker} kind of {disfmarker} you stop back and suddenly it goes away and you have to kind of work again to recapture it , but yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Right , Yeah , so anyway , so {disfmarker} So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh , make this distinction . Of course there are behavioral differences too . Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference . And i this is , um {disfmarker} So . In addition to the e\nGrad E: This is more proximal - distal .\nProfessor C: Yeah uh exactly . So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded . S\nGrad E: Well , Dan Montello sort of , he {disfmarker} he does the uh uh {disfmarker} th the cognitive map world , down in Santa Barbara . And he {disfmarker} he always talks about these {disfmarker} He {disfmarker} he already {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} i probably most likely without knowing this {disfmarker} this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Well there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw . Anyway yeah , so we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll look at this . And . So , all of these issues now {disfmarker} are now starting to come up . So , now {disfmarker} we 're now done with demos . We 're starting to do science , right ? And so these issues about uh , reference , and {disfmarker} spatial {comment} reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh {comment} all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: um {disfmarker} So , all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now . So we gotta do all this . So there 's that . And then there 's also a set of system things that come up . So \" OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Right ?\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: It {disfmarker} it follows . And so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gonna build something and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is , and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the um , the grammar stuff .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology , so , um {disfmarker} And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on uh , \" is there an ontology API that {disfmarker} that \" {disfmarker} There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we build the parser and stuff around that , or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so {disfmarker} For example , is there something that we can use there . i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML have something that we can just p pull out , for that . Uh , so there are gonna be some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some things like that , which are not science but system . But we aren't gonna ignore those cuz we 're {disfmarker} we 're not only going {disfmarker} The plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . And how much we build , and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . So . It 's always been out of phase but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that . So we 've talked about it , and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing ,\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: It was just this uh construction analyzer . And so we think {disfmarker} we think we have a shot at {disfmarker} at that .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So . The for So . To {disfmarker} to come full circle on that , this formalization task , OK ? is trying to get the formalism into {disfmarker} into a shape where it can actually uh\nGrad B: Yeah . Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , right ?\nProfessor C: d Well , yeah , where it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} covers the whole range of things . And the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms . It turned out , inherently not to cover the space .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And it just {disfmarker} it was just terribly frustrating for him ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing .\nGrad B: I see . Right .\nProfessor C: And . Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .\nGrad B: OK . Good to know .\nProfessor C: Uh . Huh ? Is {disfmarker} This is true , is it not ?\nGrad D: Yes .\nProfessor C: OK . So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad F: You don't have a hidden purist streak ?\nGrad D: Oh no .\nProfessor C: We - well it hasn't it {disfmarker} it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case .\nGrad F: OK . Just checking .\nGrad D: No sir .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK . Uh . So . For {disfmarker} for {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Cuz I don't have to implement anything .\nProfessor C: Exactly right . Exactly .\nGrad F: I have a problem , then . It 's {disfmarker} So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad B: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: Right . Why {disfmarker} a actually , uh , the thing is , you {disfmarker} you do but , th the thing you have to im implement is so small that {disfmarker} Uh .\nGrad F: Which meeting I 'm in . It 's OK to be purist within that context .\nProfessor C: Within that , yeah ,\nGrad F: Yes ,\nProfessor C: and uh , it 's {disfmarker} a and still , I think , you know , get something done .\nGrad F: good .\nGrad B: Cool !\nProfessor C: But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if {disfmarker} if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , {vocalsound} is real hard .\nGrad F: Yay .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space ,\nPhD A: It 's possible yeah .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , uh , for his absentee thesis . I think you all know that {disfmarker} that you can just , in Germany {disfmarker} almost just send in your thesis .\nGrad B: Just a drive up . Ca - chuk !\nPhD A: Um\nProfessor C: Yeah right .\nGrad B: There you go .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad E: The - th There {disfmarker} there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh {vocalsound} joint over in Saarbruecken .\nGrad B: Exactly . Drive through , yeah .\nProfessor C: It costs a lot . The {disfmarker} the amount {disfmarker} You put in your credit card and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as well . But , uh , {disfmarker} But anyway , so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , so that {disfmarker} that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into . And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So , de Uh . And her name is Eva .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: It really is . Nobody believed th th that {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah , I thought it had to be a joke , of your part , you know\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad F: like {disfmarker} {comment} \" Johno made it up , I 'm sure . \"\nGrad G: Is this person someone who 's in first - year this year ,\nProfessor C: No , first year coming .\nGrad G: or\nProfessor C: So , she 's {disfmarker} she 's now out here she 's moved , and she 'll be a student as of then .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh .\nGrad E: Document .\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor C: Uh , against all traditions . And actually I talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . Uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Someone from the class ?\nProfessor C: No , interestingly enough .\nGrad F: We always get these people who are not in the class , who {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Some of th some of them , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's interesting .\nProfessor C: So anyway , uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Uh , so , um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read . So we 'll see how this goes . Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first {disfmarker} {comment} incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , so we 'll see how that goes . Um , anyway , so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , I 'm not sure . It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes . S so , we 'll see . And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape ,\nPhD A: OK .\nProfessor C: so uh and ,\nPhD A: Right\nProfessor C: I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the {disfmarker} your traditional questions in this light , uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be quite happy to uh see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and um , how they might uh get reflected in constructions .\nGrad B: Sure .\nProfessor C: I suspect that 's right .\nGrad B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I may have to go to Switzerland for {disfmarker} in June or beginning of July for between two weeks and four weeks , but uh , after that or before that .\nProfessor C: OK , fine . And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in {disfmarker} in the neighborhood .\nPhD A: Right . Yeah be uh actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yep . E o do y\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , we we 're connected to uh {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a very significant connection between {disfmarker} We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go through this ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh {disfmarker} It 's the {disfmarker} Fr Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes . There 's one in {disfmarker} in Zurich ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: E T and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne ,\nGrad B: Oh , so in Switzerland .\nProfessor C: OK ? which is uh E P\nPhD A: Great .\nProfessor C: F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: Probably we 're connected to them .\nPhD A: Great . I 'll let you know . S I 'll send you email .\nProfessor C: OK . Yeah , and so anyway we c uh {disfmarker} We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Hmm . Uh . I {disfmarker} I think the one you {disfmarker} you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .\nPhD A: Sure , yeah .\nProfessor C: A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so , and {disfmarker} and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .\nPhD A: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor C: And you 'll get feedback from these guys .\nPhD A: Great , yeah .\nProfessor C: Cuz they 've actually {disfmarker} these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . So we 'll set that up .\nPhD A: Cool .\nProfessor C: OK . So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the {disfmarker} uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I tho It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .\nProfessor C: OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying \" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand \" . And that we as a group will try to {disfmarker} to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .\nGrad G: Sure .\nProfessor C: OK ? Uh , \" these are the decisions \" {disfmarker} I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: You know . We {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Does that so make sense ?\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , the {disfmarker} the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ?\nGrad G: No , I {disfmarker} I think I 'll be done {disfmarker} everything by this uh {disfmarker} by the end of this week .\nGrad E: Same with you ? No .\nGrad D: Nnn . This {disfmarker} Well , I 've {disfmarker} I have projects , but then the {disfmarker} my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess .\nGrad G: Hmm .\nProfessor C: Right . Um , But anyway , yeah .\nGrad B: Pretty soon .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so I guess that 's\nGrad D: So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .\nProfessor C: Right . right . So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking , uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: right ? So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So we 'll do that . Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa\nGrad B: Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah .\nProfessor C: We {disfmarker} we want those ,\nGrad B: Yeah , oh yeah .\nProfessor C: right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So let me {disfmarker} let me make a note to do that .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer ,\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Oh right ! Right right right !\nGrad B: so .\nProfessor C: That 's great ! Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: Hi\nGrad B: Right , no faculty !\nProfessor C: Th - the faculty aren't {disfmarker} faculty aren't supposed to know .\nGrad D: Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .\nProfessor C: But um , I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah , right . It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all ,\nGrad D: Bhaskara .\nGrad B: right .", "answers": ["The final english SmartKom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised."], "pred": " The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery", "length": 12646, "dataset": "qmsum", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "23625b932c93b52caf7504ee1a134d53a4096dc59744d759"}

Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't care . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh this , you mean ?\nProject Manager: Yes . The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: the sides .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah .

Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up .

That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , six .\nMarketing: So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , true or false .\nMarketing: And you {gap} true or false .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .\nMarketing: And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry .\nProject Manager: You ?\nUser Interface: Three .\nProject Manager: Me too . So it's a three .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .\nUser Interface: Mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .\nProject Manager: So it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's uh a six .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nUser Interface: Mm , four .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think it's four .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: but\nProject Manager: Yes . So , I think it's four .\nUser Interface: older {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .\nProject Manager: Okay . Give it a four .\nIndustrial Designer: Four .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Four . Uh , okay . Mm .\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics .\nMarketing: That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .\nIndustrial Designer: Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . Two .\nProject Manager: Uh , I say uh a five .\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't .\nIndustrial Designer: It {disfmarker} it will be fashion .\nProject Manager: Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Then make it th three .\nMarketing: Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too .\nProject Manager: No . Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Three is okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , agree ?\nProject Manager: I use my feet though . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A three .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .\nIndustrial Designer: I give it a one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} . Yes , a one . I like it .\nProject Manager: Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We have to do our uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Say two .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nProject Manager: Okay , two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Two . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You ?\nUser Interface: One . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Me too . One .\nMarketing: One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next , six . It does not get lost easily .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Just a small thing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah . Yellow .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Looks like a pistol .\nProject Manager: Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .\nProject Manager: No . It won't get lost .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It won't .\nProject Manager: A one ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , o one .\nProject Manager: Okay , a one .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: Next .\nMarketing: Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .\nProject Manager: Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Me too .\nProject Manager: That was our target . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel .\nMarketing: Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T\nIndustrial Designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yes , a one .\nProject Manager: I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I think s two is better .\nUser Interface: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Two is okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .\nProject Manager: No , it's new . Innovation .\nMarketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm , three .\nProject Manager: Me too . Three .\nMarketing: A three .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .\nProject Manager: Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} .\nMarketing: So , we will do that . Yes .\nProject Manager: Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .\nMarketing: By nine .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Come on . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , nah . Okay .\nMarketing: So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's good .\nMarketing: So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think {gap} .\nMarketing: Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: And I closed your slide-show .\nProject Manager: Back to my uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .\nProject Manager: Yep . Next please .\nMarketing: Next . Finance .\nProject Manager: So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cheapest there is .\nProject Manager: Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .\nIndustrial Designer: Expensive .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it's the most advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the simple , regular and advanced .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} we have half rubber , half plastic .\nUser Interface: Mm , yes .\nProject Manager: No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yellow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: And it's not really a s\nIndustrial Designer: Joystick uh thing .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , no . It's too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh\nProject Manager: So , we have to change something .\nIndustrial Designer: What what are the costs ?\nProject Manager: Fifteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Fifteen .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour .\nMarketing: {gap} . We would have uh n\nIndustrial Designer: A special colour .\nProject Manager: Oh , no , we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .\nProject Manager: No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?\nMarketing: For a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} What ?\nMarketing: I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .\nProject Manager: Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ?\nProject Manager: That's one Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: One Euro discount . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .\nProject Manager: Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh .\nProject Manager: Then it's not good anymore .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yellow rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: No one will see it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , normal .\nIndustrial Designer: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And it's twelve Euros , I think .\nProject Manager: One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No . Uh , no , no , no .\nProject Manager: Or it's then a regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay then .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: How did User Interface introduce the prototype of the remote control?\nAnswer:", "input": "How did User Interface introduce the prototype of the remote control?", "context": "Project Manager: Okay . So , now um , {vocalsound} last time . Can you uh {vocalsound} push the button ? {vocalsound} One time please . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't care . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh this , you mean ?\nProject Manager: Yes . The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: the sides .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer: The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , six .\nMarketing: So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , true or false .\nMarketing: And you {gap} true or false .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .\nMarketing: And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry .\nProject Manager: You ?\nUser Interface: Three .\nProject Manager: Me too . So it's a three .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .\nUser Interface: Mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .\nProject Manager: So it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's uh a six .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nUser Interface: Mm , four .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think it's four .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: but\nProject Manager: Yes . So , I think it's four .\nUser Interface: older {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .\nProject Manager: Okay . Give it a four .\nIndustrial Designer: Four .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Four . Uh , okay . Mm .\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics .\nMarketing: That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .\nIndustrial Designer: Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . Two .\nProject Manager: Uh , I say uh a five .\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't .\nIndustrial Designer: It {disfmarker} it will be fashion .\nProject Manager: Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Then make it th three .\nMarketing: Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too .\nProject Manager: No . Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Three is okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , agree ?\nProject Manager: I use my feet though . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A three .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .\nIndustrial Designer: I give it a one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} . Yes , a one . I like it .\nProject Manager: Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We have to do our uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Say two .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nProject Manager: Okay , two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Two . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You ?\nUser Interface: One . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Me too . One .\nMarketing: One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next , six . It does not get lost easily .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Just a small thing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah . Yellow .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Looks like a pistol .\nProject Manager: Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .\nProject Manager: No . It won't get lost .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It won't .\nProject Manager: A one ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , o one .\nProject Manager: Okay , a one .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: Next .\nMarketing: Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .\nProject Manager: Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Me too .\nProject Manager: That was our target . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel .\nMarketing: Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T\nIndustrial Designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yes , a one .\nProject Manager: I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I think s two is better .\nUser Interface: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Two is okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .\nProject Manager: No , it's new . Innovation .\nMarketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm , three .\nProject Manager: Me too . Three .\nMarketing: A three .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .\nProject Manager: Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} .\nMarketing: So , we will do that . Yes .\nProject Manager: Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .\nMarketing: By nine .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Come on . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , nah . Okay .\nMarketing: So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's good .\nMarketing: So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think {gap} .\nMarketing: Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: And I closed your slide-show .\nProject Manager: Back to my uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .\nProject Manager: Yep . Next please .\nMarketing: Next . Finance .\nProject Manager: So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cheapest there is .\nProject Manager: Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .\nIndustrial Designer: Expensive .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it's the most advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the simple , regular and advanced .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} we have half rubber , half plastic .\nUser Interface: Mm , yes .\nProject Manager: No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yellow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: And it's not really a s\nIndustrial Designer: Joystick uh thing .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , no . It's too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh\nProject Manager: So , we have to change something .\nIndustrial Designer: What what are the costs ?\nProject Manager: Fifteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Fifteen .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour .\nMarketing: {gap} . We would have uh n\nIndustrial Designer: A special colour .\nProject Manager: Oh , no , we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .\nProject Manager: No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?\nMarketing: For a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} What ?\nMarketing: I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .\nProject Manager: Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ?\nProject Manager: That's one Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: One Euro discount . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .\nProject Manager: Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh .\nProject Manager: Then it's not good anymore .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yellow rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: No one will see it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , normal .\nIndustrial Designer: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And it's twelve Euros , I think .\nProject Manager: One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No . Uh , no , no , no .\nProject Manager: Or it's then a regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay then .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} .", "answers": ["The color of the prototype was yellow and the material was half rubber and half plastic with a company logo.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad E: I guess .\nGrad A: OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .\nGrad E: Check one . Check one .\nGrad A: And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .\nGrad B: So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one .\nGrad A: Yep .\nGrad E: Sibilance . Sibilance .\nGrad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .\nGrad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?\nGrad A: No . No .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nGrad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .\nGrad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .\nGrad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .\nGrad B: For our stuff . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .\nProfessor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .\nGrad A: OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , we can start doing it .\nGrad A: Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh {disfmarker} So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form {disfmarker} I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?\nProfessor C: Um , yeah .\nGrad A: or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor C: No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?\nGrad B: I sent an email .\nProfessor C: She got an emai she was notified .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor C: Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ?\nGrad A: Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: So the\nProfessor C: OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Sure .\nGrad A: Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: Um , but uh ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .\nProfessor C: OK . Mm - hmm . No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor C: I just wanted to understand .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .\nGrad A: Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: but we find that {disfmarker} We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: and we don't want people to be editing what they say .\nGrad B: Right .\nGrad A: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly\nGrad A: OK . So th\nProfessor C: your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .\nGrad A: Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um . {vocalsound} There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're {disfmarker} we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh {disfmarker} and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to {disfmarker} to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor C: No .\nGrad A: OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . It should be on already . Um . Either one of those . And uh , read the digit strings and {disfmarker} and fill out the forms . So , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent .\nGrad B: I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late ,\nGrad A: Yeah .\nGrad B: so you will have to leave what you set .\nGrad A: Right . And uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad A: And {disfmarker} I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n {nonvocalsound} Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one . It 'll just be sitting here .\nGrad B: Input ? Yeah . There we go .\nProfessor C: By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: So , you know . Wow ! Organization . So you guys who got email about this {pause} oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to .\nGrad E: No .\nGrad F: No .\nGrad B: I got it .\nGrad E: What was the nature of the email ?\nProfessor C: Oh , this was about {pause} um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words , like \" s go to see \" , or \" visit \" , or some\nGrad B: Wel - we I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: You didn't get it ?\nGrad E: I don't think I did .\nProfessor C: I guess these g have got better filters . Cuz I sent it to everybody . You just blew it off .\nGrad E: Ah .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: It 's really simple though . So this is the idea . Um . We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's {disfmarker} it 's worth it but , uh , I think we {disfmarker} we will agree on that , um , to come up with a {disfmarker} with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some {disfmarker} some research , and some modeling . So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , um , and focus on that object down {disfmarker} Oh , I can actually walk with this . This is nice . down here . That 's the Powder - Tower . Now , um , {vocalsound} we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . And touch it . But you cannot enter or do anything else . Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there . It 's just a dark alley . But you can touch it . If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , {comment} you have to go this way , and go up here . And there you have a vre really view {disfmarker} It exploded , the {disfmarker} during the Thirty years - war . Really uh , interesting sight . And um , these uh {disfmarker} these lines are , um , paths ,\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: or so That 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part . Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take {disfmarker} to lead people this way . It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . So , {vocalsound} what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . Maybe you want to enter a building . Maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it . Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . For whatever reason that may be .\nGrad E: What 's it {disfmarker} what 's it made out of ?\nGrad B: Um , r red limestone .\nGrad E: So maybe you would wanna touch it .\nGrad B: Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . Um . Okay , I {disfmarker} This , um {disfmarker} These intentions , we {disfmarker} w w we could , if we want to , call it the {disfmarker} the Vista mode , where we just want to {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} s get the overview or look at it , the Enter mode , and the , well , Tango mode . I always come up with {disfmarker} with silly names . So this \" Tango \" means , literally translated , \" to touch \" . So {disfmarker} But sometimes the {disfmarker} the Tango mode is really relevant in the {disfmarker} in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh {disfmarker} If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some {disfmarker} Uh , I didn't look through all the data . um , and there {disfmarker} there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people {disfmarker} uh , the ways people phrase how to g get {disfmarker} if they want to get to a certain place . And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: No , OK come in , sit down . If you grab yourself a microphone .\nGrad B: You need to sign some stuff and read some digits .\nProfessor C: Well , you can sign afterwards .\nGrad B: O or later .\nGrad E: You have to al also have to read some digits .\nProfessor C: Afterwards .\nGrad D: OK . {comment} OK . Afterwards is fine .\nGrad B: They are uncomfortable . Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: Really small ? OK . I see . OK .\nGrad B: Yep .\nGrad D: Thank you .\nGrad B: OK , but that was our idea .\nProfessor C: And it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it it also has to be switched on , Nance .\nGrad B: Is {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: No , that one 's already on , I thought he said .\nProfessor C: It 's on ? OK , good .\nGrad D: OK . It 's on .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad B: OK . That was the idea . Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . Sometimes they want to enter it . And sometimes they want to get really close to it . That 's something we found . It 's just a truism . And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . I {disfmarker} I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where {disfmarker} if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may , uh {disfmarker} may phrase those requests to a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of {disfmarker} of these \" how do I get to \" , \" I want to go to \" , but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" I would like to see \" . And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the {disfmarker} the data {disfmarker} That was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . First of all , very important , and um , that {disfmarker} I 've completely forgot that when we talked . This is of course a crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \" So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of . Or very rarely . But you usually want to enter them . Some objects are more picturesque , and you {disfmarker} more f more highly photographed . Then of course the {disfmarker} the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . Um . Sometimes I found in the {disfmarker} Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that {disfmarker} that m may also give us a hint , um , \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh ? \" I need to get to \" . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and {disfmarker} and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of {disfmarker} of a phrase . So , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} My suggestion is really simple . We start with , um {disfmarker} Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these . So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure . Sort of action \" go \" , and then an object .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Yeah ? and a source . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . So , I thought , \" Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . \" Where we can start it and n sort of look {disfmarker} \" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . The crude , undifferentiated parse . Interpreted input . We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . We 'll see . And I will try to {disfmarker} to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . So this is not something which we can actually monitor , {vocalsound} now , but just is something we can set . And then you can all imagine sort of a {disfmarker} a constrained satisfaction program , depending on {disfmarker} on what , um , comes out . We want to have an {disfmarker} a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or {disfmarker} or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we {disfmarker} we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode . Which I think we maybe want to ignore . But . That 's my idea . It 's up for discussion . We can change all of it , any bit of it . Throw it all away .\nGrad F: Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually .\nProfessor C: What ?\nGrad F: Now I remember the email .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad E: Huh . Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email . I 'll have to go back and check .\nProfessor C: Not important . So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is . And , the {disfmarker} the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday . And we think it 's well - formed . So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .\nGrad F: So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ? Is it , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Well , it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's always all of it . So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep . But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . And , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to {disfmarker} Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it . It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . So , uh , and this is {disfmarker} Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gonna be contextual things , there 're gonna be linguistic things , there 're gonna be discourse things , and they gotta be combined . And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better . Um , the idea would be that {vocalsound} you , uh , take your {disfmarker} You 're editing your slide ?\nGrad B: Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas , uh w uh .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad B: So , discourse {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thought about that . Of course that needs to sort of go in there .\nProfessor C: Oh . I 'm sorry . OK . So . This is minutes {disfmarker} taking minutes as we go , in his {disfmarker} in his own way .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: Um , but the p the {disfmarker} Anyway . So the thing is , {vocalsound} i uh , d naively speaking , you 've {disfmarker} you 've got a {disfmarker} for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to {disfmarker} uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . Um . So that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . And , then the question is {disfmarker} there are two questions {disfmarker} is , uh , one , where do you get this i {comment} information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? And you probably need intermediate nodes . I {disfmarker} we don't know what they are yet . So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether {disfmarker} Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day . Now , they may wanna call that part of context .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But the time of day matters a lot . And , if things are obviously closed , then , you {disfmarker}\nGrad B: People won't want to enter it .\nProfessor C: Pe - people don't wanna enter them . And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed {disfmarker} you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .\nGrad B: s b\nProfessor C: So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a {disfmarker} more of a dialogue . So if someone says something you could ask them .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . And {disfmarker} Now , one thing you could do is always ask them , but that 's boring . And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it . So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , \" whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers . Ask them which one you want . \" OK . But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do .\nGrad B: But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call .\nProfessor C: Oh yeah . You want the {disfmarker} you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask , but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time , and i That 's not getting at the scientific problem ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: and it 's {disfmarker} In general you 're {disfmarker} you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that . a This is purposely a really simple case .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So , uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad B: I have one more point to {disfmarker} to Bhaskara 's question . Um , I think also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the deep understanding part of it is {disfmarker} is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling . We can start , you know , basic from human beings , model that , its motions , going , walking , seeing , we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . That will be extremely deep in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in my understanding .\nProfessor C: Yeah . S so {disfmarker} so the way that might come up , if you wanna {disfmarker} Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , \" Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? \" OK ? And if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ? Or is there a focus on the path ? or something . And that could be , uh , one of the conditiona you know , th the {disfmarker} In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the {disfmarker} the appropriate thing to enter .\nGrad F: So , where would we extract that information from ? From the M - three - L ?\nProfessor C: No . No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th What he was saying is , the M - three - L does not have any of that . All it has is some really crude stuff saying , \" A person wants to go to a place . \"\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ?\nProfessor C: Right . M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language .\nGrad E: OK . It 's just a language . Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: So we have th w we we we have to have a better w way of referring to {disfmarker}\nGrad B: The parser output ?\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: \" Analyzed speech \" I think it 's what they call it ,\nProfessor C: Yeah . The {disfmarker} Well , OK .\nGrad B: really , oder {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gonna get .\nProfessor C: Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice , but tha\nGrad B: In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis .\nProfessor C: Anyway .\nGrad B: They call it intention hypotheses .\nProfessor C: Right . So , th they 're gonna give us some cr uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} We can assume that y you get this crude information . About intention , and that 's all they 're going to provide . And they don't give you the kind of object , they don't give you any discourse history , if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else .\nGrad B: Well , they keep it . We have to request it .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Nuh ? But it 's not in there .\nProfessor C: Well , they {disfmarker} they kee they keep it by their lights .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nProfessor C: It may {disfmarker} it may or may not be what {disfmarker} what we want .\nGrad B: Yeah , or i\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: So , if someone says , \" I wanna touch the side of the Powder - Tower \" , that would {disfmarker} basically , we need to pop up Tango mode and the {disfmarker} and the directions ?\nProfessor C: If i if {disfmarker} Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: But it wouldn't .\nGrad E: OK . But that doesn't necessarily {disfmarker} But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for touching the side , right ?\nGrad B: Well {disfmarker} Uh , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . Correct ? Um , because um , sometimes people just say things {disfmarker} This you find very often . \" Where is the city hall ? \" And this do they don't wanna sh see it on a map , or they don't wanna know it 's five hundred yards away from you , or that it 's to the {disfmarker} your north . They wanna go there . That 's what they say , is , \" Where is it ? \" . Where is that damn thing ?\nGrad E: And the parser would output {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Well , that 's a {disfmarker} a question mark . sh A lot of parsers , um , just , uh {disfmarker} That 's way beyond their scope , is {disfmarker} of interpreting that . You know ? But um , still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure , with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a WH focus on the town hall . But to interpret it ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: you know ? somebody else has to do that job later .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output , depending on these things .\nGrad B: Um , it will probably tell you how far away it is , at least that 's {disfmarker} That 's even what Deep Map does . It tells you how far away it is , and {disfmarker} and shows it to you on a map . Because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where {disfmarker} where it is .\nGrad D: People no might not be able to infer that either , right ? Like the fact {disfmarker} Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , \" Where 's the city hall ? \" , I might say , g ar \" Are you trying to get there ? \" Because how I describe um , t its location {disfmarker} uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , \" It 's half a mile away \" or something like that .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .  It 's a granularity factor ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: because where people ask you , \" Where is New York ? \" , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast .\nGrad D: Uh - huh . Yeah . Exactly . Right . Right .\nGrad B: Y y eh {disfmarker} you won't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there .\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: So th They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: So .\nGrad D: Right .\nProfessor C: But {disfmarker} i Go {disfmarker} go back to the {disfmarker} the uh , th\nGrad B: So I w this is {disfmarker} \" onto \" is {disfmarker} is knowledge about buildings ,\nProfessor C: Yeah , that slide .\nGrad B: their opening times , and then t coupled with time of day , um , this should {disfmarker} You know .\nGrad D: So that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context , i like business or travel , as well as the utterance context , like , \" I 'm now standing at this place at this time \" .\nProfessor C: Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We {disfmarker} we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context , which is what you have as context , and discourse context ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: which you have as DH ,\nGrad B: Nuh .\nProfessor C: I don't know what the H means .\nGrad B: History . Discourse history . Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . Whatever . So we can work out terminology later .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: So , they 're {disfmarker} they 're quite distinct . I mean , you need them both , but they 're quite distinct . And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics . Except to find out what seems to be {pause} useful . So , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be {disfmarker} Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea , but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , given these {disfmarker} We have all these transcripts and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . Saying , \" Aha ! here 're the things which , if you get them out of {disfmarker} out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . \" And if {disfmarker} to actually do that , build it , um {disfmarker} you know , run it {disfmarker} y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters . And see how that goes . If that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . So {disfmarker} where would you get this information ? And , expand it to {disfmarker} to other things like this . But if we can't do that , then we 're in trouble . I mean th th i i if you can't do this task , um {disfmarker}\nGrad B: We need a different , uh , engine . Machine , I mean .\nProfessor C: Uh , uh , yeah , or something . Well it {disfmarker} i I if it {disfmarker} if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , but I don't think that 's gonna be the case . I think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ? And I don't know .\nGrad B: Hmm . But , only w\nProfessor C: Hold on a s Hold on a second .\nGrad B: Muh .\nProfessor C: So , I know . Uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ?\nGrad F: Yep .\nGrad D: Um , I missed the beginning , but , um I guess {disfmarker} could you back to the slide , the previous one ? So , is it that it 's , um {disfmarker} These are all factors that uh , a These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ? or that we want to {vocalsound} take into account ? You were saying n\nProfessor C: Take them into account . But {disfmarker} but you don't worry about {disfmarker} h\nGrad D: Take the {disfmarker} the linguistic factors too . Oh , how to extract these features .\nProfessor C: how to extract them . So , f let 's find out which ones we need first ,\nGrad D: OK . Got it .\nProfessor C: and {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK . And {disfmarker} and it 's clear from the data , um , like , sorta the correct answer in each case .\nProfessor C: No .\nGrad D: But l\nGrad B: No . But {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the slide of data .\nGrad D: That 's {disfmarker} that 's the thing I 'm curious ab\nGrad B: Um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Like do we know from the data wh which {disfmarker} OK . So {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Not from that data . But , um , since we are designing a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , {comment} um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: in some shape , way , form over the other ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Um , from this , we can sometimes , you know {disfmarker} an and that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} but that {disfmarker} isn't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ? is sort of {disfmarker} s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Right .\nGrad B: you know ?\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net . So , um , this is exactly what {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Because y you can never be sure . And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , \" Well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . \"\nGrad D: Sure .\nGrad B: You know , because then , uh , you {disfmarker}\nGrad D: u u I mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task . Right ? Where you have {disfmarker} where your , uh , current goal is to {disfmarker}\nGrad B: We Yeah ! That 's what we 're doing .\nGrad D: \nGrad B: But {disfmarker} but we will still get the phrasing all over the place .\nGrad D: So that 's what you want ? OK . So you will know .\nGrad B: I 'm sure that , you know {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . The {disfmarker} No , that 's fine . I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: From that task , yeah . So , uh , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room\nGrad D: \nProfessor C: and start recording subjects probably within a month or something . So , this is not any {disfmarker} lo any of you guys ' worry , except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need . So our job {vocalsound} is to figure out how to solve these problems . If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that . And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects . So , yeah {disfmarker} y you 're absolutely right , though . No , you {disfmarker} you will not have , and there it is , and , uh {disfmarker} But you know , y y the , um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: And I think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} I don't know if this was collected {disfmarker} what situation this data was collected in . Was it {disfmarker} is it the one that you showed in your talk ? Like people {disfmarker}\nGrad B: No , no . No .\nGrad D: But OK . So was this , like , someone actually mobile , like {disfmarker} s using a device ?\nGrad B: Uh , N no , no not {disfmarker} i it was mobile but not {disfmarker} not with a w a real wizard system . So there were never answers .\nGrad D: Uh - huh . OK . OK . But , is it {disfmarker} I guess I don't know {disfmarker} The situation of {disfmarker} of collecting th the data of , like {disfmarker} Here you could imagine them being {disfmarker} walking around the city . as like one situation . And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: If they 're doing it in a {disfmarker} you know , \" I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions \" , I {disfmarker} I would imagine that the data would be really different . Um , so it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah . But {disfmarker} It was never th th the goal of that data collection to {disfmarker} to serve for sat for such a purpose . So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: there was n there was no label ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: you know , intention A , intention B , intention C .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Or task A , B , C . Um I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it , um , that {disfmarker} that will help us along those lines .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: But , you know , you gotta leave something for other people to model . So , to {disfmarker} Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: what suffices and what doesn't . And then we can start worrying about where to get this input , what {disfmarker} what do we need , you know {disfmarker} Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Hmm .\nGrad B: It 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment .\nGrad E: How exactly does the data collection work ? Do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ?\nGrad B: OK . Imagine you 're the {disfmarker} the subject . You 're gonna be in here , and somebody {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and you see , uh , either th the three - D model , or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg . So you actually see that . Um . The uh , um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg . So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth . So that 's part one . Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , and it understands you completely . And so you 're gonna pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve . First you have to know {disfmarker} find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . Maybe {disfmarker} So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . The third one is to get information on the history of an object . The fourth one {disfmarker} And then the g system breaks down . It crashes , And {disfmarker}\nGrad D: a At the third ? Right then ?\nGrad B: After the third task .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad B: And then {disfmarker} Or after the fourth . Some find {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Forget that for now . And then , a human operator comes on , and {disfmarker} and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . And so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . Oh , and one {disfmarker} one little bit {disfmarker} w And uh , the computer you are {disfmarker} you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS . When the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know . So the GPS is crashed as well . So the person first has to ask you \" Where are you ? \" . And so you have to do some {disfmarker} s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . Um , this is a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a bit that I d I don't think we {disfmarker} Did we discuss that bit ? Uh , I just sort of squeezed that in now . But it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know . So .\nGrad D: So , in the display you can {disfmarker} Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah . a Additionally , y you have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a sort of a map type display .\nGrad D: a w your perspective ? sort of ?\nGrad B: Uh , two - D .\nGrad D: And so , as you {disfmarker}\nGrad B: n\nGrad D: Oh , two - D . OK .\nGrad B: Two - D .\nGrad D: So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the {disfmarker} for themselves\nGrad B: Yeah . b y You don't {disfmarker} That 's {disfmarker}\nGrad D: there .\nGrad B: I don't know . I but y I don't think you really move , sort of .\nGrad D: OK . So\nGrad B: Yeah ? I mean that would be an {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} an enormous technical effort , unless we would {disfmarker} We can show it walks to , you know . We can have movies of walking , you walking through {disfmarker} through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Maybe we wanna do that . Yeah .\nGrad D: Uh , I was just trying to figure out how {disfmarker} how ambitious the system is .\nGrad B: The map was sort of intended to {disfmarker} You want to go to that place . You know , and it 's sort of there .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: And you see the label of the name {disfmarker} So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . So your tasks don't require you to {disfmarker} I mean , uh {disfmarker} yo you 're told {disfmarker} So when your task is , I don't know , \" Go buy stamps \" or something like that ? So , do you have to respond ? or does your {disfmarker} Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w what you 're doing now ? or {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Well , we 'll see what people do .\nGrad D: There 's no {disfmarker} OK , so it 's just like , \" Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances \" .\nGrad B: Yeah , and {disfmarker} and we will record both sides . I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nGrad B: I mean , in both cases it 's gonna be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case .\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nGrad B: And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? So , you first have to do this , and that ,\nGrad D: Yep .\nGrad B: and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: see wh what they say . We can ins instruct the , uh , wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be . But um , maybe the {disfmarker} maybe what you 're suggesting {disfmarker} Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? You wanna m have it more {disfmarker} more steps , sort of ?\nGrad D: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction {disfmarker} I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Oh yeah , but {disfmarker} to some extent this is a different discussion .\nGrad D: Right ? So {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK ? So . Uh , we {disfmarker} we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard . Uh , she 's gonna get in touch with me . It 's a student of Eve 's . FEY , Fey ? Spelled FEY . Do you {disfmarker} do you {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Oh , Fey Parrill .\nProfessor C: You know her ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: OK . Sh - Is sh\nGrad D: She started taking the class last year and then didn't {disfmarker} um , you know , didn't continue . I g She 's a g\nProfessor C: She 's graduated .\nGrad D: Is she an undergradua She is a graduate , OK .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad D: Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that .\nProfessor C: OK . So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school . And she 'll be in touch . So we may have someone , uh , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in {disfmarker} in all this stuff . And is a linguist st and , so So . {vocalsound} That 's {disfmarker} So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mmm .\nProfessor C: So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing .\nGrad D: OK . I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , but with intention {vocalsound} um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors and {disfmarker} I 'm not really sure , um , how {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that {disfmarker} Um , it 's ju it 's just hard . So , I mean , obviously it 's a {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , uh , actually I guess that was my question . Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ? Like , do the {disfmarker}\nGrad D: It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was .\nGrad D: to {disfmarker} to give {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: n No one is , at the moment .\nGrad D: Right . Right .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .\nGrad D: Right .\nProfessor C: But , uh ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: the {disfmarker} The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention , and set the context , and know what language was used . So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data . Um . The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .\nGrad D: w What are the t three intentions ? Is it to go there , to see it , and {disfmarker}\nGrad B: To come as close as possible to it .\nProfessor C: Th - the terminology we 're using is to {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Yeah , it 's @ @ .\nProfessor C: Go back . To v\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: to View it . OK ? To Enter it . Now those {disfmarker} It seems to me those are cl you c you have no trouble with those being distinct . \" Take a picture of it \" you {disfmarker} you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And , for an object that 's at all big , uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh , could be quite different than either of those .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Just sort of {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK , so now I understand the referent of Tango mode . I didn't get that before .\nGrad E: See , I would have thought it was more of a waltz .\nGrad B: S To \" Waltz \" it ?\nGrad D: Yeah , like , how close are you gonna be ?\nProfessor C: Well .\nGrad D: Like , {vocalsound} Tango 's really close .\nGrad E: Yeah , cuz a tango {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , anyway . So {disfmarker}\nGrad F: All these So , like , the question is how what features can {disfmarker} like , do you wanna try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ?\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: Like , the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh , stem , or {disfmarker} certain construction or whatever .\nProfessor C: Right . Is there a construction , or the kind of object , or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the {disfmarker} in the s the discourse itself or in the context . So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature . Now , how you determine that is another issue . But fo for the current problem , it would just be , \" OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , \" or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , \" pppt ! \" Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .\nGrad F: Right . So , how should {disfmarker} What 's the uh , plan ? Like , how should we go about figuring out these {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK . So , first of all is , uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? JavaBayes or something ?\nGrad F: Oh . No , not really .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , anyway . f Get one . OK ? So {disfmarker} y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package , doesn't matter which one , uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . d w These are not gonna get big in {disfmarker} in the foreseeable future . But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . Because i that 's {disfmarker} A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , um , playing with this . And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files . So that if {disfmarker} if we have all these cases {disfmarker} OK ? So we make up cases that have these features , OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , \" OK , here 's a bunch of cases \" {disfmarker} There 're even ones tha that you can do learning OK ? So you have all their cases and {disfmarker} and their results and you have a {disfmarker} algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the {disfmarker} the probabilities for you . Um , probably that 's not worth it . I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the {disfmarker} these data fitting ones worth it , but I don't know . So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package . OK , and you wanna it s You know , the standard things you want it stable , you want it {disfmarker} yeah , @ @ . And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on .\nGrad B: An - Nuh .\nProfessor C: But it {disfmarker} what I like about it is it 's very concrete . OK ? We {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} we know what the outcomes are gonna be , and we have some {disfmarker} some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition , and see how hard it is , and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . So it {disfmarker} if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to {disfmarker} You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: And it {disfmarker} and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis . I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , that are contained in the data , um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them . And {disfmarker} and that altogether could also be {disfmarker} uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it . And um {disfmarker} When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language Java ?\nProfessor C: No , th It turns out that there is a , uh {disfmarker} The new end of Java libraries . OK , and it turns out one called\nGrad B: Mmm . OK .\nProfessor C: Which is one that fair {disfmarker} people around here use a fair amount . I have no idea whether that 's {disfmarker}  The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So that i that 's I think why a lot of people doing research use that . But it may not be {disfmarker} I have no idea whether that 's the best choice an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets . So , uh ,\nGrad D: There 's the m tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed ,\nProfessor C: Right . It 's OK .\nGrad D: which might be useful too .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with .\nGrad D: And it 's available Matlab code .\nProfessor C: Nancy knows him well . I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: but , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah , I know him .\nGrad B: But i But since we all probably are pretty sure that , um , the {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: For example , this th th the dialogue history is {disfmarker} is um , producing XML documents . M - three - L of course is XML . And the ontology that um , uh the student is {disfmarker} is constructing for me back in {disfmarker} in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML . And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nGrad B: Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able {disfmarker} We can couple .\nProfessor C: Yeah . So , yeah , we 're sort of {nonvocalsound} committed to XML as the kind of , uh , interchange . But that 's , you know , not a big deal .\nGrad B: Who isn't , nuh ?\nProfessor C: So , in terms of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} interchanging in and out of any module we build , It 'll be XML . And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's fine an and um , all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind . So they {disfmarker} they have worked very hard . It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth . So , that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet . I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML , um , little descriptors . I believe .\nGrad B: Hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I like , for example , the {disfmarker} what you said about the getting input from {disfmarker} from just files about where you h where you have the data , have specified the features and so forth .\nProfessor C: I don't {disfmarker} I don't see {disfmarker}\nGrad B: That 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , XML .\nProfessor C: Uh , you could have an X {disfmarker} yeah , you could make and XML format for that . Sure .\nGrad B: So r\nProfessor C: That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} um , you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any . So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that um , do things you 'd like .\nGrad F: Doesn't {disfmarker} does SmartKom system have such packages ?\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Sure .\nGrad B: The {disfmarker} the lib M - three - L library does that . It 's also {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: And the question is , d you c you {disfmarker} you 'll have to l We 'll have to l That should be {disfmarker} ay We should be able to look at that {disfmarker}\nGrad B: No , u u y um the {disfmarker} What I {disfmarker} What sort of came to my mind i is {disfmarker} was the notion of an idea that if {disfmarker} if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um , probability factors based on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on input {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: which is in file format , if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some {disfmarker} some corpora that other people made and , for example , if {disfmarker} if they are in {disfmarker} in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Um , Michael has a project where {disfmarker} you know , recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE , and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data . So if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not {disfmarker} not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of {disfmarker} of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: It 'd be nice , but {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do I don't wanna count on it . I mean , you can't {disfmarker} you can't run your project based on the speculation that {disfmarker} that the data will come ,\nGrad B: No , no , uh , just for {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: and you don't have to actually design the nets .\nGrad B: Nuh . Just a back door that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think we should devote m\nProfessor C: Could happen . Yeah . So in terms of {disfmarker} of the , um {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . You don't {disfmarker} You know , you don't really like it . So we 're not {disfmarker} we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages . We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format , but hey .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: Um , it 's , uh {disfmarker} It doesn't control what you do in you know , internally .\nGrad B: \nGrad E: What 's the time frame for this ?\nGrad B: Two days ? Two , three days ?\nProfessor C: Huh ? Yeah bu w I 'd like that this {disfmarker} y yeah , this week , to ha to n to {vocalsound} have y guys , uh , you know , pick {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} y you know , belief - net package\nGrad B: No .\nProfessor C: and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something .\nGrad F: Sure .\nProfessor C: And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem . Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on , and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way . I mean , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site or {disfmarker} You know , how\nGrad B: Uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} um , OK , I {disfmarker} t Yeah . I was actually more joking . With the two or three days . So this was {disfmarker} was a usual jo\nProfessor C: OK , I wasn't .\nGrad B: Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Right .\nGrad B: But um , maybe it might be interesting if {disfmarker} if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked , and what it does , and how it does that .\nProfessor C: Well , y Well , or both of them speak .\nGrad F: Sure .\nGrad B: Yeah , or you can split it up .\nProfessor C: We don't care .\nGrad B: So , y\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad B: So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} for slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and {disfmarker} and how far you 've gotten . Pppt !\nProfessor C: Well , I 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . Even if it 's really crude . OK ? So , you know , here a here are {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot ,\nProfessor C: Right . Yeah .\nGrad E: and {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is , I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , \" Here 's the package , here 's the current one we have , \" uh , you know , \" What other ideas do you have ? \" and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file . Of , uh , you know , get a {disfmarker} t a p tentative format for it , let 's say XML , that says , l you know , \" These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . \" We can just add to that and there 'll be this {disfmarker} this file of them and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this , um {disfmarker} this data file .\nGrad F: So we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities .\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah , unt until we know more .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: And what 's the relation to this with {disfmarker} Changing the table so that the system works in English ?\nGrad B: OK . So this is {disfmarker} Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails . The {disfmarker} the full NT and the full Linux version are there . I 've downloaded them both , and I started to unpack the Linux one {disfmarker} Uh , the NT one worked fine . and I started unta pack the Linux one , it told me that I can't really unpack it because it contains a future date . So this is the time difference between Germany . I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it . Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we {disfmarker} I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .\nGrad E: I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker} You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad B: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,\nGrad F: Mmm .\nGrad B: which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .\nGrad D: Oh , really ?\nGrad B: So . Um {disfmarker} So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} because car navigation systems don't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad B: But even that is problematic .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad B: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ?\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .\nGrad D: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .\nGrad B: Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Clear ?\nGrad F: OK . Sounds good .\nGrad E: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .\nGrad D: I was wondering .\nGrad B: Do you wanna see a picture ?\nGrad D: OK . Sure !\nGrad E: Sure !\nGrad B: Have to reboot for that though .\nGrad D: Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?\nProfessor C: Of course they use the sample data .\nGrad D: Is it like {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker} Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?\nGrad B: There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . \"\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .\nGrad B: Talk features . Yep .\nProfessor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .\nGrad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .\nProfessor C: Uh , is that OK ?\nGrad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .\nProfessor C: Alright . Oh . Ni\nGrad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .\nGrad B: Ahh .\nGrad E: OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .\nGrad D: That 's right , OK .\nGrad B: Mmm .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did C think about setting up the recording equipment?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did C think about setting up the recording equipment?", "context": "Grad E: I guess .\nGrad A: OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .\nGrad E: Check one . Check one .\nGrad A: And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .\nGrad B: So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one .\nGrad A: Yep .\nGrad E: Sibilance . Sibilance .\nGrad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .\nGrad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?\nGrad A: No . No .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nGrad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .\nGrad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .\nGrad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .\nGrad B: For our stuff . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .\nProfessor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .\nGrad A: OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , we can start doing it .\nGrad A: Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh {disfmarker} So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form {disfmarker} I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?\nProfessor C: Um , yeah .\nGrad A: or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor C: No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?\nGrad B: I sent an email .\nProfessor C: She got an emai she was notified .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor C: Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ?\nGrad A: Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: So the\nProfessor C: OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Sure .\nGrad A: Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: Um , but uh ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .\nProfessor C: OK . Mm - hmm . No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor C: I just wanted to understand .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .\nGrad A: Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: but we find that {disfmarker} We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: and we don't want people to be editing what they say .\nGrad B: Right .\nGrad A: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly\nGrad A: OK . So th\nProfessor C: your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .\nGrad A: Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um . {vocalsound} There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're {disfmarker} we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh {disfmarker} and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to {disfmarker} to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor C: No .\nGrad A: OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . It should be on already . Um . Either one of those . And uh , read the digit strings and {disfmarker} and fill out the forms . So , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent .\nGrad B: I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late ,\nGrad A: Yeah .\nGrad B: so you will have to leave what you set .\nGrad A: Right . And uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad A: And {disfmarker} I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n {nonvocalsound} Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one . It 'll just be sitting here .\nGrad B: Input ? Yeah . There we go .\nProfessor C: By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: So , you know . Wow ! Organization . So you guys who got email about this {pause} oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to .\nGrad E: No .\nGrad F: No .\nGrad B: I got it .\nGrad E: What was the nature of the email ?\nProfessor C: Oh , this was about {pause} um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words , like \" s go to see \" , or \" visit \" , or some\nGrad B: Wel - we I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: You didn't get it ?\nGrad E: I don't think I did .\nProfessor C: I guess these g have got better filters . Cuz I sent it to everybody . You just blew it off .\nGrad E: Ah .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: It 's really simple though . So this is the idea . Um . We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's {disfmarker} it 's worth it but , uh , I think we {disfmarker} we will agree on that , um , to come up with a {disfmarker} with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some {disfmarker} some research , and some modeling . So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , um , and focus on that object down {disfmarker} Oh , I can actually walk with this . This is nice . down here . That 's the Powder - Tower . Now , um , {vocalsound} we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . And touch it . But you cannot enter or do anything else . Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there . It 's just a dark alley . But you can touch it . If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , {comment} you have to go this way , and go up here . And there you have a vre really view {disfmarker} It exploded , the {disfmarker} during the Thirty years - war . Really uh , interesting sight . And um , these uh {disfmarker} these lines are , um , paths ,\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: or so That 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part . Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take {disfmarker} to lead people this way . It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . So , {vocalsound} what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . Maybe you want to enter a building . Maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it . Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . For whatever reason that may be .\nGrad E: What 's it {disfmarker} what 's it made out of ?\nGrad B: Um , r red limestone .\nGrad E: So maybe you would wanna touch it .\nGrad B: Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . Um . Okay , I {disfmarker} This , um {disfmarker} These intentions , we {disfmarker} w w we could , if we want to , call it the {disfmarker} the Vista mode , where we just want to {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} s get the overview or look at it , the Enter mode , and the , well , Tango mode . I always come up with {disfmarker} with silly names . So this \" Tango \" means , literally translated , \" to touch \" . So {disfmarker} But sometimes the {disfmarker} the Tango mode is really relevant in the {disfmarker} in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh {disfmarker} If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some {disfmarker} Uh , I didn't look through all the data . um , and there {disfmarker} there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people {disfmarker} uh , the ways people phrase how to g get {disfmarker} if they want to get to a certain place . And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: No , OK come in , sit down . If you grab yourself a microphone .\nGrad B: You need to sign some stuff and read some digits .\nProfessor C: Well , you can sign afterwards .\nGrad B: O or later .\nGrad E: You have to al also have to read some digits .\nProfessor C: Afterwards .\nGrad D: OK . {comment} OK . Afterwards is fine .\nGrad B: They are uncomfortable . Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: Really small ? OK . I see . OK .\nGrad B: Yep .\nGrad D: Thank you .\nGrad B: OK , but that was our idea .\nProfessor C: And it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it it also has to be switched on , Nance .\nGrad B: Is {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: No , that one 's already on , I thought he said .\nProfessor C: It 's on ? OK , good .\nGrad D: OK . It 's on .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad B: OK . That was the idea . Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . Sometimes they want to enter it . And sometimes they want to get really close to it . That 's something we found . It 's just a truism . And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . I {disfmarker} I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where {disfmarker} if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may , uh {disfmarker} may phrase those requests to a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of {disfmarker} of these \" how do I get to \" , \" I want to go to \" , but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" I would like to see \" . And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the {disfmarker} the data {disfmarker} That was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . First of all , very important , and um , that {disfmarker} I 've completely forgot that when we talked . This is of course a crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \" So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of . Or very rarely . But you usually want to enter them . Some objects are more picturesque , and you {disfmarker} more f more highly photographed . Then of course the {disfmarker} the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . Um . Sometimes I found in the {disfmarker} Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that {disfmarker} that m may also give us a hint , um , \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh ? \" I need to get to \" . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and {disfmarker} and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of {disfmarker} of a phrase . So , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} My suggestion is really simple . We start with , um {disfmarker} Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these . So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure . Sort of action \" go \" , and then an object .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Yeah ? and a source . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . So , I thought , \" Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . \" Where we can start it and n sort of look {disfmarker} \" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . The crude , undifferentiated parse . Interpreted input . We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . We 'll see . And I will try to {disfmarker} to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . So this is not something which we can actually monitor , {vocalsound} now , but just is something we can set . And then you can all imagine sort of a {disfmarker} a constrained satisfaction program , depending on {disfmarker} on what , um , comes out . We want to have an {disfmarker} a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or {disfmarker} or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we {disfmarker} we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode . Which I think we maybe want to ignore . But . That 's my idea . It 's up for discussion . We can change all of it , any bit of it . Throw it all away .\nGrad F: Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually .\nProfessor C: What ?\nGrad F: Now I remember the email .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad E: Huh . Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email . I 'll have to go back and check .\nProfessor C: Not important . So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is . And , the {disfmarker} the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday . And we think it 's well - formed . So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .\nGrad F: So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ? Is it , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Well , it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's always all of it . So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep . But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . And , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to {disfmarker} Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it . It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . So , uh , and this is {disfmarker} Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gonna be contextual things , there 're gonna be linguistic things , there 're gonna be discourse things , and they gotta be combined . And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better . Um , the idea would be that {vocalsound} you , uh , take your {disfmarker} You 're editing your slide ?\nGrad B: Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas , uh w uh .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad B: So , discourse {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thought about that . Of course that needs to sort of go in there .\nProfessor C: Oh . I 'm sorry . OK . So . This is minutes {disfmarker} taking minutes as we go , in his {disfmarker} in his own way .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: Um , but the p the {disfmarker} Anyway . So the thing is , {vocalsound} i uh , d naively speaking , you 've {disfmarker} you 've got a {disfmarker} for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to {disfmarker} uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . Um . So that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . And , then the question is {disfmarker} there are two questions {disfmarker} is , uh , one , where do you get this i {comment} information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? And you probably need intermediate nodes . I {disfmarker} we don't know what they are yet . So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether {disfmarker} Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day . Now , they may wanna call that part of context .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But the time of day matters a lot . And , if things are obviously closed , then , you {disfmarker}\nGrad B: People won't want to enter it .\nProfessor C: Pe - people don't wanna enter them . And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed {disfmarker} you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .\nGrad B: s b\nProfessor C: So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a {disfmarker} more of a dialogue . So if someone says something you could ask them .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . And {disfmarker} Now , one thing you could do is always ask them , but that 's boring . And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it . So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , \" whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers . Ask them which one you want . \" OK . But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do .\nGrad B: But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call .\nProfessor C: Oh yeah . You want the {disfmarker} you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask , but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time , and i That 's not getting at the scientific problem ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: and it 's {disfmarker} In general you 're {disfmarker} you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that . a This is purposely a really simple case .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So , uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad B: I have one more point to {disfmarker} to Bhaskara 's question . Um , I think also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the deep understanding part of it is {disfmarker} is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling . We can start , you know , basic from human beings , model that , its motions , going , walking , seeing , we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . That will be extremely deep in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in my understanding .\nProfessor C: Yeah . S so {disfmarker} so the way that might come up , if you wanna {disfmarker} Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , \" Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? \" OK ? And if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ? Or is there a focus on the path ? or something . And that could be , uh , one of the conditiona you know , th the {disfmarker} In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the {disfmarker} the appropriate thing to enter .\nGrad F: So , where would we extract that information from ? From the M - three - L ?\nProfessor C: No . No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th What he was saying is , the M - three - L does not have any of that . All it has is some really crude stuff saying , \" A person wants to go to a place . \"\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ?\nProfessor C: Right . M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language .\nGrad E: OK . It 's just a language . Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: So we have th w we we we have to have a better w way of referring to {disfmarker}\nGrad B: The parser output ?\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: \" Analyzed speech \" I think it 's what they call it ,\nProfessor C: Yeah . The {disfmarker} Well , OK .\nGrad B: really , oder {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gonna get .\nProfessor C: Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice , but tha\nGrad B: In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis .\nProfessor C: Anyway .\nGrad B: They call it intention hypotheses .\nProfessor C: Right . So , th they 're gonna give us some cr uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} We can assume that y you get this crude information . About intention , and that 's all they 're going to provide . And they don't give you the kind of object , they don't give you any discourse history , if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else .\nGrad B: Well , they keep it . We have to request it .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Nuh ? But it 's not in there .\nProfessor C: Well , they {disfmarker} they kee they keep it by their lights .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nProfessor C: It may {disfmarker} it may or may not be what {disfmarker} what we want .\nGrad B: Yeah , or i\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: So , if someone says , \" I wanna touch the side of the Powder - Tower \" , that would {disfmarker} basically , we need to pop up Tango mode and the {disfmarker} and the directions ?\nProfessor C: If i if {disfmarker} Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: But it wouldn't .\nGrad E: OK . But that doesn't necessarily {disfmarker} But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for touching the side , right ?\nGrad B: Well {disfmarker} Uh , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . Correct ? Um , because um , sometimes people just say things {disfmarker} This you find very often . \" Where is the city hall ? \" And this do they don't wanna sh see it on a map , or they don't wanna know it 's five hundred yards away from you , or that it 's to the {disfmarker} your north . They wanna go there . That 's what they say , is , \" Where is it ? \" . Where is that damn thing ?\nGrad E: And the parser would output {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Well , that 's a {disfmarker} a question mark . sh A lot of parsers , um , just , uh {disfmarker} That 's way beyond their scope , is {disfmarker} of interpreting that . You know ? But um , still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure , with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a WH focus on the town hall . But to interpret it ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: you know ? somebody else has to do that job later .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output , depending on these things .\nGrad B: Um , it will probably tell you how far away it is , at least that 's {disfmarker} That 's even what Deep Map does . It tells you how far away it is , and {disfmarker} and shows it to you on a map . Because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where {disfmarker} where it is .\nGrad D: People no might not be able to infer that either , right ? Like the fact {disfmarker} Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , \" Where 's the city hall ? \" , I might say , g ar \" Are you trying to get there ? \" Because how I describe um , t its location {disfmarker} uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , \" It 's half a mile away \" or something like that .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .  It 's a granularity factor ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: because where people ask you , \" Where is New York ? \" , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast .\nGrad D: Uh - huh . Yeah . Exactly . Right . Right .\nGrad B: Y y eh {disfmarker} you won't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there .\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: So th They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: So .\nGrad D: Right .\nProfessor C: But {disfmarker} i Go {disfmarker} go back to the {disfmarker} the uh , th\nGrad B: So I w this is {disfmarker} \" onto \" is {disfmarker} is knowledge about buildings ,\nProfessor C: Yeah , that slide .\nGrad B: their opening times , and then t coupled with time of day , um , this should {disfmarker} You know .\nGrad D: So that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context , i like business or travel , as well as the utterance context , like , \" I 'm now standing at this place at this time \" .\nProfessor C: Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We {disfmarker} we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context , which is what you have as context , and discourse context ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: which you have as DH ,\nGrad B: Nuh .\nProfessor C: I don't know what the H means .\nGrad B: History . Discourse history . Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . Whatever . So we can work out terminology later .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: So , they 're {disfmarker} they 're quite distinct . I mean , you need them both , but they 're quite distinct . And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics . Except to find out what seems to be {pause} useful . So , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be {disfmarker} Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea , but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , given these {disfmarker} We have all these transcripts and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . Saying , \" Aha ! here 're the things which , if you get them out of {disfmarker} out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . \" And if {disfmarker} to actually do that , build it , um {disfmarker} you know , run it {disfmarker} y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters . And see how that goes . If that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . So {disfmarker} where would you get this information ? And , expand it to {disfmarker} to other things like this . But if we can't do that , then we 're in trouble . I mean th th i i if you can't do this task , um {disfmarker}\nGrad B: We need a different , uh , engine . Machine , I mean .\nProfessor C: Uh , uh , yeah , or something . Well it {disfmarker} i I if it {disfmarker} if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , but I don't think that 's gonna be the case . I think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ? And I don't know .\nGrad B: Hmm . But , only w\nProfessor C: Hold on a s Hold on a second .\nGrad B: Muh .\nProfessor C: So , I know . Uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ?\nGrad F: Yep .\nGrad D: Um , I missed the beginning , but , um I guess {disfmarker} could you back to the slide , the previous one ? So , is it that it 's , um {disfmarker} These are all factors that uh , a These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ? or that we want to {vocalsound} take into account ? You were saying n\nProfessor C: Take them into account . But {disfmarker} but you don't worry about {disfmarker} h\nGrad D: Take the {disfmarker} the linguistic factors too . Oh , how to extract these features .\nProfessor C: how to extract them . So , f let 's find out which ones we need first ,\nGrad D: OK . Got it .\nProfessor C: and {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK . And {disfmarker} and it 's clear from the data , um , like , sorta the correct answer in each case .\nProfessor C: No .\nGrad D: But l\nGrad B: No . But {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the slide of data .\nGrad D: That 's {disfmarker} that 's the thing I 'm curious ab\nGrad B: Um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Like do we know from the data wh which {disfmarker} OK . So {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Not from that data . But , um , since we are designing a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , {comment} um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: in some shape , way , form over the other ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Um , from this , we can sometimes , you know {disfmarker} an and that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} but that {disfmarker} isn't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ? is sort of {disfmarker} s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Right .\nGrad B: you know ?\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net . So , um , this is exactly what {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Because y you can never be sure . And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , \" Well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . \"\nGrad D: Sure .\nGrad B: You know , because then , uh , you {disfmarker}\nGrad D: u u I mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task . Right ? Where you have {disfmarker} where your , uh , current goal is to {disfmarker}\nGrad B: We Yeah ! That 's what we 're doing .\nGrad D: \nGrad B: But {disfmarker} but we will still get the phrasing all over the place .\nGrad D: So that 's what you want ? OK . So you will know .\nGrad B: I 'm sure that , you know {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . The {disfmarker} No , that 's fine . I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: From that task , yeah . So , uh , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room\nGrad D: \nProfessor C: and start recording subjects probably within a month or something . So , this is not any {disfmarker} lo any of you guys ' worry , except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need . So our job {vocalsound} is to figure out how to solve these problems . If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that . And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects . So , yeah {disfmarker} y you 're absolutely right , though . No , you {disfmarker} you will not have , and there it is , and , uh {disfmarker} But you know , y y the , um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: And I think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} I don't know if this was collected {disfmarker} what situation this data was collected in . Was it {disfmarker} is it the one that you showed in your talk ? Like people {disfmarker}\nGrad B: No , no . No .\nGrad D: But OK . So was this , like , someone actually mobile , like {disfmarker} s using a device ?\nGrad B: Uh , N no , no not {disfmarker} i it was mobile but not {disfmarker} not with a w a real wizard system . So there were never answers .\nGrad D: Uh - huh . OK . OK . But , is it {disfmarker} I guess I don't know {disfmarker} The situation of {disfmarker} of collecting th the data of , like {disfmarker} Here you could imagine them being {disfmarker} walking around the city . as like one situation . And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: If they 're doing it in a {disfmarker} you know , \" I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions \" , I {disfmarker} I would imagine that the data would be really different . Um , so it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah . But {disfmarker} It was never th th the goal of that data collection to {disfmarker} to serve for sat for such a purpose . So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: there was n there was no label ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: you know , intention A , intention B , intention C .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Or task A , B , C . Um I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it , um , that {disfmarker} that will help us along those lines .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: But , you know , you gotta leave something for other people to model . So , to {disfmarker} Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: what suffices and what doesn't . And then we can start worrying about where to get this input , what {disfmarker} what do we need , you know {disfmarker} Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Hmm .\nGrad B: It 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment .\nGrad E: How exactly does the data collection work ? Do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ?\nGrad B: OK . Imagine you 're the {disfmarker} the subject . You 're gonna be in here , and somebody {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and you see , uh , either th the three - D model , or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg . So you actually see that . Um . The uh , um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg . So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth . So that 's part one . Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , and it understands you completely . And so you 're gonna pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve . First you have to know {disfmarker} find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . Maybe {disfmarker} So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . The third one is to get information on the history of an object . The fourth one {disfmarker} And then the g system breaks down . It crashes , And {disfmarker}\nGrad D: a At the third ? Right then ?\nGrad B: After the third task .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad B: And then {disfmarker} Or after the fourth . Some find {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Forget that for now . And then , a human operator comes on , and {disfmarker} and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . And so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . Oh , and one {disfmarker} one little bit {disfmarker} w And uh , the computer you are {disfmarker} you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS . When the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know . So the GPS is crashed as well . So the person first has to ask you \" Where are you ? \" . And so you have to do some {disfmarker} s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . Um , this is a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a bit that I d I don't think we {disfmarker} Did we discuss that bit ? Uh , I just sort of squeezed that in now . But it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know . So .\nGrad D: So , in the display you can {disfmarker} Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah . a Additionally , y you have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a sort of a map type display .\nGrad D: a w your perspective ? sort of ?\nGrad B: Uh , two - D .\nGrad D: And so , as you {disfmarker}\nGrad B: n\nGrad D: Oh , two - D . OK .\nGrad B: Two - D .\nGrad D: So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the {disfmarker} for themselves\nGrad B: Yeah . b y You don't {disfmarker} That 's {disfmarker}\nGrad D: there .\nGrad B: I don't know . I but y I don't think you really move , sort of .\nGrad D: OK . So\nGrad B: Yeah ? I mean that would be an {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} an enormous technical effort , unless we would {disfmarker} We can show it walks to , you know . We can have movies of walking , you walking through {disfmarker} through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Maybe we wanna do that . Yeah .\nGrad D: Uh , I was just trying to figure out how {disfmarker} how ambitious the system is .\nGrad B: The map was sort of intended to {disfmarker} You want to go to that place . You know , and it 's sort of there .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: And you see the label of the name {disfmarker} So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . So your tasks don't require you to {disfmarker} I mean , uh {disfmarker} yo you 're told {disfmarker} So when your task is , I don't know , \" Go buy stamps \" or something like that ? So , do you have to respond ? or does your {disfmarker} Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w what you 're doing now ? or {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Well , we 'll see what people do .\nGrad D: There 's no {disfmarker} OK , so it 's just like , \" Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances \" .\nGrad B: Yeah , and {disfmarker} and we will record both sides . I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nGrad B: I mean , in both cases it 's gonna be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case .\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nGrad B: And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? So , you first have to do this , and that ,\nGrad D: Yep .\nGrad B: and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: see wh what they say . We can ins instruct the , uh , wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be . But um , maybe the {disfmarker} maybe what you 're suggesting {disfmarker} Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? You wanna m have it more {disfmarker} more steps , sort of ?\nGrad D: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction {disfmarker} I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Oh yeah , but {disfmarker} to some extent this is a different discussion .\nGrad D: Right ? So {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK ? So . Uh , we {disfmarker} we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard . Uh , she 's gonna get in touch with me . It 's a student of Eve 's . FEY , Fey ? Spelled FEY . Do you {disfmarker} do you {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Oh , Fey Parrill .\nProfessor C: You know her ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: OK . Sh - Is sh\nGrad D: She started taking the class last year and then didn't {disfmarker} um , you know , didn't continue . I g She 's a g\nProfessor C: She 's graduated .\nGrad D: Is she an undergradua She is a graduate , OK .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad D: Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that .\nProfessor C: OK . So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school . And she 'll be in touch . So we may have someone , uh , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in {disfmarker} in all this stuff . And is a linguist st and , so So . {vocalsound} That 's {disfmarker} So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mmm .\nProfessor C: So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing .\nGrad D: OK . I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , but with intention {vocalsound} um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors and {disfmarker} I 'm not really sure , um , how {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that {disfmarker} Um , it 's ju it 's just hard . So , I mean , obviously it 's a {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , uh , actually I guess that was my question . Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ? Like , do the {disfmarker}\nGrad D: It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was .\nGrad D: to {disfmarker} to give {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: n No one is , at the moment .\nGrad D: Right . Right .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .\nGrad D: Right .\nProfessor C: But , uh ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: the {disfmarker} The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention , and set the context , and know what language was used . So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data . Um . The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .\nGrad D: w What are the t three intentions ? Is it to go there , to see it , and {disfmarker}\nGrad B: To come as close as possible to it .\nProfessor C: Th - the terminology we 're using is to {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Yeah , it 's @ @ .\nProfessor C: Go back . To v\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: to View it . OK ? To Enter it . Now those {disfmarker} It seems to me those are cl you c you have no trouble with those being distinct . \" Take a picture of it \" you {disfmarker} you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And , for an object that 's at all big , uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh , could be quite different than either of those .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Just sort of {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK , so now I understand the referent of Tango mode . I didn't get that before .\nGrad E: See , I would have thought it was more of a waltz .\nGrad B: S To \" Waltz \" it ?\nGrad D: Yeah , like , how close are you gonna be ?\nProfessor C: Well .\nGrad D: Like , {vocalsound} Tango 's really close .\nGrad E: Yeah , cuz a tango {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , anyway . So {disfmarker}\nGrad F: All these So , like , the question is how what features can {disfmarker} like , do you wanna try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ?\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: Like , the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh , stem , or {disfmarker} certain construction or whatever .\nProfessor C: Right . Is there a construction , or the kind of object , or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the {disfmarker} in the s the discourse itself or in the context . So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature . Now , how you determine that is another issue . But fo for the current problem , it would just be , \" OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , \" or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , \" pppt ! \" Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .\nGrad F: Right . So , how should {disfmarker} What 's the uh , plan ? Like , how should we go about figuring out these {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK . So , first of all is , uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? JavaBayes or something ?\nGrad F: Oh . No , not really .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , anyway . f Get one . OK ? So {disfmarker} y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package , doesn't matter which one , uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . d w These are not gonna get big in {disfmarker} in the foreseeable future . But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . Because i that 's {disfmarker} A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , um , playing with this . And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files . So that if {disfmarker} if we have all these cases {disfmarker} OK ? So we make up cases that have these features , OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , \" OK , here 's a bunch of cases \" {disfmarker} There 're even ones tha that you can do learning OK ? So you have all their cases and {disfmarker} and their results and you have a {disfmarker} algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the {disfmarker} the probabilities for you . Um , probably that 's not worth it . I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the {disfmarker} these data fitting ones worth it , but I don't know . So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package . OK , and you wanna it s You know , the standard things you want it stable , you want it {disfmarker} yeah , @ @ . And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on .\nGrad B: An - Nuh .\nProfessor C: But it {disfmarker} what I like about it is it 's very concrete . OK ? We {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} we know what the outcomes are gonna be , and we have some {disfmarker} some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition , and see how hard it is , and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . So it {disfmarker} if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to {disfmarker} You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: And it {disfmarker} and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis . I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , that are contained in the data , um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them . And {disfmarker} and that altogether could also be {disfmarker} uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it . And um {disfmarker} When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language Java ?\nProfessor C: No , th It turns out that there is a , uh {disfmarker} The new end of Java libraries . OK , and it turns out one called\nGrad B: Mmm . OK .\nProfessor C: Which is one that fair {disfmarker} people around here use a fair amount . I have no idea whether that 's {disfmarker}  The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So that i that 's I think why a lot of people doing research use that . But it may not be {disfmarker} I have no idea whether that 's the best choice an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets . So , uh ,\nGrad D: There 's the m tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed ,\nProfessor C: Right . It 's OK .\nGrad D: which might be useful too .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with .\nGrad D: And it 's available Matlab code .\nProfessor C: Nancy knows him well . I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: but , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah , I know him .\nGrad B: But i But since we all probably are pretty sure that , um , the {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: For example , this th th the dialogue history is {disfmarker} is um , producing XML documents . M - three - L of course is XML . And the ontology that um , uh the student is {disfmarker} is constructing for me back in {disfmarker} in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML . And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nGrad B: Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able {disfmarker} We can couple .\nProfessor C: Yeah . So , yeah , we 're sort of {nonvocalsound} committed to XML as the kind of , uh , interchange . But that 's , you know , not a big deal .\nGrad B: Who isn't , nuh ?\nProfessor C: So , in terms of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} interchanging in and out of any module we build , It 'll be XML . And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's fine an and um , all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind . So they {disfmarker} they have worked very hard . It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth . So , that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet . I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML , um , little descriptors . I believe .\nGrad B: Hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I like , for example , the {disfmarker} what you said about the getting input from {disfmarker} from just files about where you h where you have the data , have specified the features and so forth .\nProfessor C: I don't {disfmarker} I don't see {disfmarker}\nGrad B: That 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , XML .\nProfessor C: Uh , you could have an X {disfmarker} yeah , you could make and XML format for that . Sure .\nGrad B: So r\nProfessor C: That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} um , you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any . So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that um , do things you 'd like .\nGrad F: Doesn't {disfmarker} does SmartKom system have such packages ?\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Sure .\nGrad B: The {disfmarker} the lib M - three - L library does that . It 's also {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: And the question is , d you c you {disfmarker} you 'll have to l We 'll have to l That should be {disfmarker} ay We should be able to look at that {disfmarker}\nGrad B: No , u u y um the {disfmarker} What I {disfmarker} What sort of came to my mind i is {disfmarker} was the notion of an idea that if {disfmarker} if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um , probability factors based on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on input {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: which is in file format , if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some {disfmarker} some corpora that other people made and , for example , if {disfmarker} if they are in {disfmarker} in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Um , Michael has a project where {disfmarker} you know , recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE , and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data . So if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not {disfmarker} not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of {disfmarker} of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: It 'd be nice , but {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do I don't wanna count on it . I mean , you can't {disfmarker} you can't run your project based on the speculation that {disfmarker} that the data will come ,\nGrad B: No , no , uh , just for {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: and you don't have to actually design the nets .\nGrad B: Nuh . Just a back door that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think we should devote m\nProfessor C: Could happen . Yeah . So in terms of {disfmarker} of the , um {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . You don't {disfmarker} You know , you don't really like it . So we 're not {disfmarker} we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages . We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format , but hey .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: Um , it 's , uh {disfmarker} It doesn't control what you do in you know , internally .\nGrad B: \nGrad E: What 's the time frame for this ?\nGrad B: Two days ? Two , three days ?\nProfessor C: Huh ? Yeah bu w I 'd like that this {disfmarker} y yeah , this week , to ha to n to {vocalsound} have y guys , uh , you know , pick {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} y you know , belief - net package\nGrad B: No .\nProfessor C: and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something .\nGrad F: Sure .\nProfessor C: And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem . Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on , and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way . I mean , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site or {disfmarker} You know , how\nGrad B: Uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} um , OK , I {disfmarker} t Yeah . I was actually more joking . With the two or three days . So this was {disfmarker} was a usual jo\nProfessor C: OK , I wasn't .\nGrad B: Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Right .\nGrad B: But um , maybe it might be interesting if {disfmarker} if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked , and what it does , and how it does that .\nProfessor C: Well , y Well , or both of them speak .\nGrad F: Sure .\nGrad B: Yeah , or you can split it up .\nProfessor C: We don't care .\nGrad B: So , y\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad B: So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} for slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and {disfmarker} and how far you 've gotten . Pppt !\nProfessor C: Well , I 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . Even if it 's really crude . OK ? So , you know , here a here are {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot ,\nProfessor C: Right . Yeah .\nGrad E: and {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is , I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , \" Here 's the package , here 's the current one we have , \" uh , you know , \" What other ideas do you have ? \" and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file . Of , uh , you know , get a {disfmarker} t a p tentative format for it , let 's say XML , that says , l you know , \" These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . \" We can just add to that and there 'll be this {disfmarker} this file of them and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this , um {disfmarker} this data file .\nGrad F: So we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities .\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah , unt until we know more .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: And what 's the relation to this with {disfmarker} Changing the table so that the system works in English ?\nGrad B: OK . So this is {disfmarker} Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails . The {disfmarker} the full NT and the full Linux version are there . I 've downloaded them both , and I started to unpack the Linux one {disfmarker} Uh , the NT one worked fine . and I started unta pack the Linux one , it told me that I can't really unpack it because it contains a future date . So this is the time difference between Germany . I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it . Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we {disfmarker} I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .\nGrad E: I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker} You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad B: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,\nGrad F: Mmm .\nGrad B: which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .\nGrad D: Oh , really ?\nGrad B: So . Um {disfmarker} So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} because car navigation systems don't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad B: But even that is problematic .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad B: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ?\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .\nGrad D: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .\nGrad B: Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Clear ?\nGrad F: OK . Sounds good .\nGrad E: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .\nGrad D: I was wondering .\nGrad B: Do you wanna see a picture ?\nGrad D: OK . Sure !\nGrad E: Sure !\nGrad B: Have to reboot for that though .\nGrad D: Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?\nProfessor C: Of course they use the sample data .\nGrad D: Is it like {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker} Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?\nGrad B: There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . \"\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .\nGrad B: Talk features . Yep .\nProfessor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .\nGrad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .\nProfessor C: Uh , is that OK ?\nGrad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .\nProfessor C: Alright . Oh . Ni\nGrad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .\nGrad B: Ahh .\nGrad E: OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .\nGrad D: That 's right , OK .\nGrad B: Mmm .", "answers": ["C began by asking some questions about the recording procedure and wanted to know what excising utterances from the transcript would look like.

OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ?\nPhD A: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: That are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: um .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it .\nProfessor D: Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK .\nPhD B: Ah , yeah .\nProfessor D: Ah .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah .\nPhD B: Uh , do you want @ @ .\nProfessor D: This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: Let 's see . Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal . The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . Um , yeah . Mmm . You know you can {disfmarker} you can comment these results ,\nPhD B: Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , um , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta , uh we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when\nPhD A: Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy .\nPhD B: w Yeah , this {disfmarker} Yeah , this number recognition acc\nPhD A: So it 's not the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Again we switch to another {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yes , and the baseline {disfmarker} the baseline have {disfmarker} i is eighty - two .\nProfessor D: Baseline is eighty - two .\nPhD B: Yeah\nPhD A: So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this .\nProfessor D: Uh , this is Italian mismatched .\nPhD A: Um .\nPhD B: Yeah , by the moment .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD B: And first in the experiment - one I {disfmarker} I do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I use different MLP ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . Um . for the ne {disfmarker} rest of experiment I use multi - English , only multi - English . And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy .\nPhD A: Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: but this is not the case for Italian what {disfmarker} where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So , um {vocalsound} uh , well , I don't think this is a bug but this {disfmarker} this is something in {disfmarker} probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But {disfmarker} that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP .\nProfessor D: I Um , the uh , baseline system {disfmarker} when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: and the training is Italian digits ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and {disfmarker} and , uh microphone and so forth ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: right ? So , um did we have {disfmarker} So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is {disfmarker} is the uh Italian digits ?\nPhD B: The train the training of the HTK ?\nProfessor D: The {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yes . Ah yes !\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD B: This h Yes . Th - Yes .\nProfessor D: Yes . Training of the net ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: yeah . So , um {disfmarker} So what that says is that in a matched condition , {vocalsound} we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . Now w would {disfmarker} do we have a number , I suppose for the matched {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't mean matched , but uh use of Italian {disfmarker} training in Italian digits for PLP only ?\nPhD B: Uh {pause} yes ?\nPhD A: Uh {pause} yeah , so this is {disfmarker} basically this is in the table . Uh {pause} so the number is fifty - two ,\nPhD B: Another table .\nPhD A: uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Fifty - two percent .\nPhD A: Fift - So {disfmarker} No , it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: No .\nProfessor D: No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ?\nPhD A: Of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of uh {pause} eighteen {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Eighty .\nPhD A: of eighteen .\nPhD B: Eighty .\nPhD A: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's error rate , basically .\nPhD B: It 's plus six .\nPhD A: It 's er error rate ratio . So {disfmarker} \nProfessor D: Oh this is accuracy ! \nPhD A: Uh , so we have nine {disfmarker} nine {disfmarker} let 's say ninety percent .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oy ! {comment} OK . Ninety .\nPhD A: Yeah . Um {comment} which is uh {comment} what we have also if use PLP and MSG together ,\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: eighty - nine point seven .\nProfessor D: OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition {disfmarker} Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping .\nPhD A: Uh . P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same {disfmarker} same results .\nProfessor D: Same result pretty much ?\nPhD A: Well , we have these results . I don't know . It 's not {disfmarker} Do you have this result with PLP alone , {comment} j fee feeding HTK ?\nProfessor D: So , s\nPhD A: That {disfmarker} That 's what you mean ?\nPhD B: Yeah ,\nPhD A: Just PLP at the input of HTK .\nPhD B: yeah yeah yeah yeah , at the first {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . So , PLP {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Eighty - eight point six .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um , so adding MSG\nPhD A: Um {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: um {disfmarker} Well , but that 's {disfmarker} yeah , that 's without the neural net ,\nPhD A: Yeah , that 's without the neural net\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD A: and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization .\nProfessor D: But she had said eighty - two .\nPhD A: This is the {disfmarker} w well , but this is without on - line normalization .\nProfessor D: Right ? Oh , this {disfmarker} the eighty - two .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: \nPhD A: Eighty - two is the {disfmarker} it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use {disfmarker} well , OGI , they use MFCC {disfmarker} th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization\nProfessor D: Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy .\nPhD A: Yeah , sorry . Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Alright . So this is {disfmarker} I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better\nPhD B: Yes , better .\nProfessor D: because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead .\nPhD A: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent .\nPhD B: Nnn , we don't know exactly .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} whatever the normalization , actually . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to {disfmarker} to ninety , or something .\nPhD A: Well , ninety {disfmarker} No , I {disfmarker} I mean ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight .\nProfessor D: Eighty - nine .\nPhD A: Well , there are minor {disfmarker} minor differences .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically .\nPhD A: No .\nProfessor D: Yeah . OK .\nPhD A: Uh For Italian , yeah .\nProfessor D: For this case , right ?\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: Alright . So , um {disfmarker} So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you {disfmarker} uh does not help in that case .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker}\nPhD A:  But w Yeah .\nProfessor D: The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but {disfmarker} And the multi - English , does uh {disfmarker} So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um {pause} and {pause} we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net .\nPhD A: Yeah\nProfessor D: And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things .\nPhD A: No .\nProfessor D: And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error . Uh {pause} no , not quite that , is it . Uh , two point six out of eighteen . About , um {pause} sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Not matching condition , but uh , the uh , Italian training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: We select these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these tasks because it 's the more difficult .\nProfessor D: Yes , good . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching , uh , data for the {disfmarker} uh for the new {disfmarker} for the other languages and so forth . Um , one qu thing is that , uh {disfmarker} I think I asked you this before , but I wanna double check . When you say \" ME \" in these other tests , that 's the multi - English ,\nPhD A: That 's {disfmarker} it 's a part {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of {disfmarker} part of it .\nPhD A: Or , one million frames .\nProfessor D: And the multi - English is how much ?\nPhD B: You have here the information .\nPhD A: It 's one million and a half . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: you think . So , it it 's still {disfmarker} it hurts you {disfmarker} seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I wonder why Yeah . Uh .\nGrad C: Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled ,\nPhD A: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: the French and the Spanish .\nPhD B: The Spanish . Maybe for that .\nProfessor D: Hmm .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: It 's still {disfmarker} OK . Alright , go ahead . And then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Um . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I {disfmarker} first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature {disfmarker} another feature .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And we s we can {disfmarker} first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta {disfmarker} PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Maybe if {disfmarker} when we have the new {disfmarker} the new {pause} neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . I don't know .\nPhD A: Actually , just to be some more {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the\nProfessor D: Yes , yeah , I mean it can't be compared with the other\nPhD A: Which number ?\nProfessor D: cuz this is , uh {disfmarker} with multi - English , uh , training .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that , uh the eighty - four point six .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Right ?\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: So {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: and straight features with delta - delta . And straight features with delta - delta gives you what 's on the first sheet .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Not t not\nPhD A: It 's eight eighty - eight point six .\nProfessor D: tr No . No . No .\nPhD B: Yes .\nProfessor D: Not trained with multi - English .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah , but th this is the second configuration .\nPhD B: No , but they {disfmarker} they feature @ @ without {disfmarker}\nPhD A: So we use feature out uh , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not {disfmarker} perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features .\nProfessor D: Eh . {comment} Oh , I see . Ah . So you 're saying w so asking the question , \" What {disfmarker} what has adding the MLP done to improve over the ,\nPhD A: So , just {disfmarker} Yeah so , actually it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it decreased the {disfmarker} the accuracy .\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: Because we have eighty - eight point six .\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: And even the MLP alone {disfmarker} What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . Oh no , it gives eighty - three point six . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six ,\nPhD B: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: that gives eighty - seven point one .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty {disfmarker} eighty - eight point six .\nPhD A: Eighty - three point six . Eighty {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Is th is that right ? Yeah ?\nPhD B: Yeah . But {disfmarker} I don't know {disfmarker} but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP {pause} delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help .\nPhD A: Perhaps , yeah .\nProfessor D: Well , that 's {disfmarker} that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that , um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's {disfmarker} let 's consider what that means . What {disfmarker} what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that {disfmarker} I mean my interpretation of your {disfmarker} your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And , um , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it {disfmarker} when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad .\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh {disfmarker} on say digits ,\nPhD A: On TI - digits ? OK .\nProfessor D: you know , d Was that experiment done ?\nPhD A: No , not yet .\nProfessor D: Yeah , OK . Uh , then does that , eh {disfmarker} you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , {comment} does it {disfmarker} does it then look much better ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh {disfmarker} of tests ? So , an anyway . OK , go ahead .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , uh , d I have found more or less the same result .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So , it 's slightly better ,\nPhD B: Little bit better ?\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: Slightly better .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Slightly bet better . Yes , is better .\nProfessor D: And {disfmarker} and you know again maybe if you use the , uh , delta {pause} there , uh , you would bring it up to where it was , uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case .\nPhD B: Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Maybe .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Well , so perhaps let 's {disfmarker} let 's jump at the last experiment .\nPhD B:  Oh , yeah .\nProfessor D: So .\nPhD A: It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output .\nPhD B: i\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: It 's again better . So it 's eighty - nine point {disfmarker} point one .\nPhD B: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and we have only forty {disfmarker} forty feature\nPhD A: So .\nPhD B: because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , uh , doesn't work {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD B: uh , well , work , but is better , the second configuration . Because I {disfmarker} for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one .\nProfessor D: Um , by the way , there is a another , uh , suggestion that would apply , uh , to the second configuration , um , which , uh , was made , uh , by , uh , Hari . And that was that , um , if you have {disfmarker} uh feed two streams into HTK , um , and you , uh , change the , uh variances {disfmarker} if you scale the variances associated with , uh these streams um , you can effectively scale {pause} the streams . Right ? So , um , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , which is the rule here , uh , you can still change the variances\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: which would effectively change the scale of these {disfmarker} these , uh , two streams that come in .\nPhD A: Uh , {comment} yeah .\nProfessor D: And , um , so , um , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , um , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And , um , so this is just setting them to be , excuse me , of equal {disfmarker} equal weight . Maybe it shouldn't be equal weight .\nPhD B: Maybe .\nProfessor D: Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , but {disfmarker} but , uh , um , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: It 's not even the HTK ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: uh , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Well , I guess you have to do the HTK training also .\nPhD B: so this is what we decided to do .\nProfessor D: Uh , do you ? Let me think . Maybe you don't . Uh . Yeah , you have to change the {disfmarker} No , you can just do it in {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} once you 've done the training {disfmarker}\nGrad C: And then you can vary it . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could {disfmarker} you could just scale them all .\nPhD A: Scale\nProfessor D: Variances .\nPhD A: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Is it {disfmarker} i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances , so I d Is it {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: That 's uh , exactly the point , I think , that if you change {disfmarker} um , change what they are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: It 's diagonal covariance matrices , but you say what those variances are .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So , that {disfmarker} you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna {disfmarker} it 's gonna {disfmarker} it 's gonna internally multiply it {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh , {vocalsound} uh , i it im uh implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the {disfmarker} change the variances {pause} of some of the features .\nPhD A: Mmm . Mmm .\nPhD B: do ?\nProfessor D: So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , uh , the s the strength that you apply the features . That was {disfmarker} that was , uh , Hari 's suggestion .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: So , um {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So . So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just {disfmarker} just not the right thing to do . Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms because , you know , maybe it should be a different {vocalsound} number for {disfmarker} for each {vocalsound} kind of {pause} test set , or something ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So I guess the other thing is to take {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} if one were to take , uh , you know , a couple of the most successful of these ,\nPhD A: Yeah , and test across everything .\nProfessor D: and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , try all these different tests .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Alright . Uh .\nPhD A: So , the next point , yeah , we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , um , about their um , uh , articulatory stuff , um . So we 'll perhaps start something next week .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Um , discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our {disfmarker} our networks with their {disfmarker} within their block diagram , uh , where to plug in the {disfmarker} the network , uh , after the {disfmarker} the feature , before as um a as a plugin or as a anoth another path , discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , um , actually Hynek would like to see , perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , uh , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band . And he would like to replace these by a network which would , uh , make the system look like a TRAP . Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system . Basically , this is a TRAP system {disfmarker} kind of TRAP system , I mean , but where the neural network are replaced by LDA . Hmm . {vocalsound} Um , yeah , and about multi - band , uh , I started multi - band MLP trainings , um mmh {comment} Actually , I w I w hhh {comment} prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything . And , mmm , I 'm starting to train also , networks with larger contexts . So , this would {disfmarker} would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and {disfmarker} but with a lot of context also . So Um Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages . For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything . So . Now we can test these two networks on {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with delta and large networks . Well , test them also on Finnish\nPhD B: Mmm .\nPhD A: and see which one is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the best . Uh , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what {disfmarker} everything that has been done . So . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one , two , three , four , uh , three , four , five , six , seven ten {disfmarker} on ten different databases .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , the number of frames is bad also , so we have one million and a half for some , three million for other , and six million for the last one . Uh , yeah ! {comment} As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled , and perhaps this is what makes the difference . Um . Yeah , the other are just Viterbi - aligned . So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things . First , um with respect to the on - line normalization , there are {disfmarker} that use bad on - line normalization , and other good on - line normalization . Um . With respect to the features , with respect to the use of delta or no , uh with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets . Uh , but of course we don't have all the combination of these different parameters Um . s What 's this ? We only have two hundred eighty six different tests And no not two thousand .\nProfessor D:  Ugh ! I was impressed boy , two thousand .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Ah , yes .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD B: I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , OK .\nPhD A: Um . Yeah , basically the observation is what we discussed already . The MSG problem , um , the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate . but when the M - MLP is trained on the um {disfmarker} is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features . Except if the features are bad {disfmarker} uh , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized . In this case the tandem is still better even if it 's trained on {disfmarker} not on the target digits .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So it sounds like {vocalsound} yeah , the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: But if you can do good normalization it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh , so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better {disfmarker} the best network .\nProfessor D: So So - Let me {disfmarker} bef before you go on to the possible issues .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So , on the MSG uh problem um , I think that in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} um , in the short {pause} time {pause} solution um , that is , um , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: uh , much as I said with JRASTA , even though I really like JRASTA and I really like MSG ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it {disfmarker} it may be complicated .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: And uh it might be {disfmarker} if someone 's interested in it , uh , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term , once we get out of this particular rush {pause} uh for results .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: But in the short term , unless you have some {disfmarker} some s strong idea of what 's wrong ,\nPhD A: I don't know at all but I 've {disfmarker} perhaps {disfmarker} I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite {disfmarker} quite simple or just like nnn , no high - pass filter\nProfessor D: Yeah , probably .\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} Mmm . Yeah . {pause} My {disfmarker} But I don't know .\nProfessor D: There 's supposed to {disfmarker} well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though , right ?\nPhD A: It 's {disfmarker} There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be uh , yeah ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: taking out means and variances and so forth . So .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design ,\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah . But this was the bad on - line normalization . Actually . Uh . Are your results are still with the bad {disfmarker} the bad {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Maybe , may {disfmarker} No ? With the better {disfmarker}\nPhD A: With the O - OLN - two ?\nPhD B: No ?\nPhD A: Ah yeah , you have {disfmarker} you have OLN - two ,\nPhD B: Oh ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! With \" two \" , with \" on - line - two \" .\nPhD A: yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah ,\nProfessor D: \" On - line - two \" is good .\nPhD A: So it 's , is the good yeah .\nPhD B: yeah . Yep , it 's a good .\nProfessor D: \" Two \" is good ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: No , \" two \" is bad .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Well , actually , it 's good with the ch with the good .\nProfessor D: OK . Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah , I {disfmarker} I agree . It 's probably something simple uh , i if {disfmarker} if uh someone , you know , uh , wants to play with it for a little bit . I mean , you 're gonna do what you 're gonna do\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker} but my {disfmarker} my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mmm . I see , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh . {comment} And the other {disfmarker} the results uh , observations two and three , Um , is\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's pretty much what we 've seen . That 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task {disfmarker} If it 's on the target task then it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it helps to have the MLP transforming it .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: If it uh {disfmarker} if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is , uh you can get uh , a reduction in performance .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And the question is now how to {disfmarker} how to get one and not the other ? Or how to {disfmarker} how to ameliorate the {disfmarker} the problems .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Um , because it {disfmarker} it certainly does {disfmarker} is nice to have in there , when it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} when there is something like the training data .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . Um . Yeah . So , {pause} the {disfmarker} the reason {disfmarker} Yeah , the reason is that the {disfmarker} perhaps the target {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the task dependency {disfmarker} the language dependency , {vocalsound} and the noise dependency {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So that 's what you say th there . I see .\nPhD A: Well , the e e But this is still not clear because , um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think we have enough result to talk about the {disfmarker} the language dependency . Well , the TIMIT network is still the best but there is also an the other difference , the fact that it 's {disfmarker} it 's hand - labeled .\nProfessor D: Hey ! Um , just {disfmarker} you can just sit here . Uh , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones but it 's uh {disfmarker} Just uh , have a seat . Um . s Summary of the first uh , uh forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and {disfmarker} works , and some stuff doesn't OK ,\nPhD A: We still have uh {pause} this {disfmarker} One of these perhaps ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think if you {disfmarker} if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words and then th that has it the {pause} associated results .\nPhD B: Um .\nProfessor D: OK . So you 're saying that um , um , although from what we see , yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , uh , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing . But you 're saying that uh , it is {disfmarker} Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about . And {disfmarker} and what is that ? I mean , you say \" not clear yet \" . What {disfmarker} what do you mean ?\nPhD A: Uh , mmm , uh , {comment} I mean , that the {disfmarker} the fact that s Well , for {disfmarker} for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best ,  which is the English net .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: But the other are slightly worse . But you have two {disfmarker} two effects , the effect of changing language and the effect of training on something that 's {pause} Viterbi - aligned instead of hand {disfmarker} hand - labeled .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: So . Um . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Do you think the alignments are bad ? I mean , have you looked at the alignments at all ? What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ?\nPhD A: Mmm . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know . Did - did you look at the Spanish alignments Carmen ?\nPhD B: Mmm , no .\nProfessor D: Might be interesting to look at it . Because , I mean , that is just looking but um , um {disfmarker} It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment . It depends how good the recognizer is\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the engine is that 's doing the alignment .\nPhD A: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . But , perhaps it 's not really the {disfmarker} the alignment that 's bad but the {disfmarker} just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment\nProfessor D: Aha !\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah . \nProfessor D: The pronunciation models and so forth\nPhD A: I mean {pause} for {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} It 's single pronunciation , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Aha .\nPhD A: French {disfmarker} French s uh , phoneme strings were corrected manually\nProfessor D: I see .\nPhD A: so we asked people to listen to the um {disfmarker} the sentence and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them . But still ,  there {disfmarker} there might be errors just in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the ph string of phonemes . Mmm . Um . Yeah , so this is not really the Viterbi alignment ,  in fact , yeah . Um , the third {disfmarker} The third uh issue is the noise dependency perhaps but , well , this is not clear yet because all our nets are trained on the same noises and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . So it {disfmarker} And that has other noise .\nPhD A: Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . Results are only coming for {disfmarker} for this net . Mmm .\nProfessor D: OK , yeah , just don't {disfmarker} just need more {disfmarker} more results there with that @ @ .\nPhD A: Yeah . Um . So . Uh , from these results we have some questions with answers . What should be the network input ? Um , PLP work as well as MFCC , I mean . Um . But it seems impor important to use the delta . Uh , with respect to the network size , there 's one experiment that 's still running and we should have the result today , comparing network with five hundred and {pause} one thousand units . So , nnn , still no answer actually .\nProfessor D: Hm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , the training set , well , some kind of answer . We can , we can tell which training set gives the best result , but {vocalsound} we don't know exactly why . Uh , so .\nProfessor D: Uh . Right , I mean the multi - English so far is {disfmarker} is the best .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: \" Multi - multi - English \" just means \" TIMIT \" ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So uh That 's {disfmarker} Yeah . So . And {disfmarker} and when you add other things in to {disfmarker} to broaden it , it gets worse {pause} uh typically .\nPhD A: Mmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Then uh some questions without answers .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Uh , training set , um ,\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: uh , training targets {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I like that . The training set is both questions , with answers and without answers .\nPhD A: It 's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: It 's sort of , yes {disfmarker} it 's mul it 's multi - uh - purpose .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Uh , training s Right . So {disfmarker} Yeah , the training targets actually , the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency {vocalsound} and the noise dependency . And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And labeling s labeling seems important uh , because of TIMIT results .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh . For moment you use {disfmarker} we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even , um use networks that doesn't do classification but just regression so uh , train to have neural networks that um , um , uh ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: does a regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . I mean uh , transform the fea noisy features {vocalsound} in other features that are not noisy . But continuous features . Not uh uh , hard targets .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah , that {pause} seems like a good thing to do , probably ,  not uh again a short - term sort of thing .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I mean one of the things about that is that um it 's {disfmarker} e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being {disfmarker} is being dependent on {disfmarker} very dependent on the kind of noise and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nPhD A: Yeah . f But , yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh . But it 's another thing to try .\nPhD A: So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this {disfmarker} this could be {disfmarker} could help {disfmarker} could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database . I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} So this is one {vocalsound} approach and the other is multi - band {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh , features - based targets could {disfmarker} could {disfmarker} could help .\nProfessor D: Yeah , if you {disfmarker} i i It 's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up {disfmarker} I mean w yeah , one {disfmarker} one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have {pause} um some reasonable database , um but then {disfmarker} which is um {vocalsound} copied over many times with a range of different noises ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If {disfmarker} Cuz what you 're trying to {pause} do is come up with a {disfmarker} a core , reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used uh , by the {disfmarker} the uh HMM {pause} system .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , OK .\nPhD A: So , um , yeah . The future work is , {pause} well , try to connect to the {disfmarker} to make {disfmarker} to plug in the system to the OGI system . Um , there are still open questions there , where to put the MLP basically .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: And I guess , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the real open question , I mean , e u there 's lots of open questions , but one of the core quote {comment} \" open questions \" for that is um , um , if we take the uh {disfmarker} you know , the best ones here , maybe not just the best one , but the best few or something {disfmarker} You want the most promising group from these other experiments . Um , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ?\nPhD A: Mmm ,\nProfessor D: Um . And y\nPhD A: Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor D: y {pause} Right ? And then um {disfmarker} then see , {pause} again , how {disfmarker} We know that there 's a mis there 's a uh {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than {disfmarker} than , uh we 're gonna test on , but well , if you look over a range of these different tests um , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features , uh stand up over that range ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: That 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that seems like the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the real question . And if you know that {disfmarker} So if you just take PLP with uh , the double - deltas . Assume that 's the p the feature . look at these different ways of combining it . And uh , take {disfmarker} let 's say , just take uh multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And just look {disfmarker} take that case and then look over all the different things . How does that {disfmarker} How does that compare between the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: So all the {disfmarker} all the test sets you mean , yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: All the different test sets ,\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: and for {disfmarker} and for the couple different ways that you have of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of combining them .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um . {pause} How well do they stand up , over the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mmm . And perhaps doing this for {disfmarker} cha changing the variance of the streams and so on {pause} getting different scaling {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: That 's another possibility if you have time , yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: Um . Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the {disfmarker} to their diagram .\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: Cuz {disfmarker} Yeah . Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn , they {disfmarker} they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates ,\nProfessor D: Yeah . {pause} It 's a little strange\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm ?\nProfessor D: but on the other hand they did it before .\nPhD A: Mmm . And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor D: Um the\nPhD A: yeah . And because also perhaps we know that the {disfmarker} when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help . So . I don't know .\nProfessor D: Um , the other thing , though , is that um {disfmarker} So . Uh , we {disfmarker} we wanna get their path running here , right ? If so , we can add this other stuff .\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: as an additional path right ?\nPhD A: Yeah , the {disfmarker} the way we want to do {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Cuz they 're doing LDA {pause} RASTA .\nPhD A: The d What ?\nProfessor D: They 're doing LDA RASTA ,\nPhD A: Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to {disfmarker} just to get the VAD labels and the final features .\nProfessor D: yeah ?\nPhD A: So they will send us the {disfmarker} Well , provide us with the feature files ,\nProfessor D: I see . I see .\nPhD A: and with VAD uh , binary labels so that we can uh , get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream . So .\nProfessor D: I see . So we {disfmarker} So . First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . Without putting in a second path .\nPhD A: Uh . You mean {disfmarker} Oh , yeah ! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ?\nProfessor D: Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we {pause} have {disfmarker} we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to {disfmarker} is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK .\nPhD A:  Oh yeah . Yeah , OK . Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh , I mean , I don't know that we need to r\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um {pause} Do we need to retrain I mean we can just take the re their training files also . But . {pause} But , uh just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results {pause} so we can duplicate it before we add in another {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mmm . OK .\nProfessor D: Cuz otherwise , you know , we won't know what things mean .\nPhD A: Oh , yeah . OK . And um . Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , I don't know if we want to {disfmarker} We can try {pause} networks with LogRASTA filtered features .\nProfessor D: Maybe .\nPhD A: Mmm . I 'm sorry ? Yeah . Well {disfmarker} Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . {comment} that u Um , uh , when you 're talking about combining multiple features , um {disfmarker} Suppose we said , \" OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , but PLP seems {pause} pretty good . \" If we take the approach that Mike did and have {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: I mean , one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions . We have different languages , we have different {disfmarker} {vocalsound} different noises , Um {pause} If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps {pause} with them .\nPhD A: \nProfessor D: And put {disfmarker} put them together . What {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , I mean {disfmarker} I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . That you did have nice interpolative effects . That is , that yes , if you knew {pause} what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . So it was sort of {disfmarker} behaved reasonably . Is tha that a fair {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . So you {disfmarker} you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: It works better if {pause} what ?\nPhD A: Yea\nProfessor D: I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was {disfmarker} So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh , uh , reverberation . Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f {pause} for this kind of task , I would think , {pause} sort of a modest amount . I mean , a million frames actually isn't that much . We have a modest amount of {disfmarker} of uh training data from a couple different conditions , and then uh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} yeah , that {disfmarker} and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type uh , and uh , {pause} uh , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . A bunch of different dimensions . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have {pause} um , the data to train up {disfmarker} I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in {disfmarker} we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is better . And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another {pause} we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability {pause} to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability {pause} that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm hoping that um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we {disfmarker} if they look at more constrained conditions they {disfmarker} they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD A: So doing both is {disfmarker} is not {disfmarker} is not right , you mean , or {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I just sort of have a feeling {disfmarker}\nPhD A: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i i e The um {disfmarker} I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA {pause} RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the {disfmarker} I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's {disfmarker} it uh {disfmarker} it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . So they did {disfmarker} At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? I mean they {disfmarker} they were not {disfmarker} not using the neural net . Uh I don't know . OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single {disfmarker} Yeah . Make stuff better . OK . Uh . {vocalsound} Yeah . And CPU memory issues . Yeah . We 've been sort of ignoring that , haven't we ?\nPhD A: Yeah , so I don't know .\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah , but I li Well , I think {disfmarker} My impression {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that {vocalsound} uh , there was a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a strict constraint on the delay ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better , and {vocalsound} using less CPU was better . Something like that ,\nPhD A: Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah . So , yeah , but we 've {disfmarker} I don't know . We have to get some reference point to where we {disfmarker} Well , what 's a reasonable number ? Perhaps be because if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's too large or {disfmarker} large or @ @ {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Um , well I don't think we 're {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} completely off the wall . I mean I think that if we {disfmarker} if we have {disfmarker} Uh , I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do {disfmarker} If we find uh {disfmarker} I mean we may find that we {disfmarker} we 're not really gonna worry about the M L You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , uh , we might even have more than one MLP . We could simply say that is uh , done on the uh , server .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And it 's uh {disfmarker} We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that . So , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} {pause} that 's OK .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor D: So I think the key thing was um , this plug into OGI . Um , what {disfmarker} what are they {disfmarker} What are they gonna be working {disfmarker} Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features ,\nPhD A: They 're {disfmarker} They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band .\nProfessor D: and {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: So . Um {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} that was Pratibha . Sunil , what was he doing , do you remember ?\nPhD B: Sunil ?\nPhD A: Yeah . He was doing something new or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I {disfmarker} I don't re I didn't remember . Maybe he 's working with {pause} neural network .\nPhD A: I don't think so . Trying to tune wha networks ?\nPhD B: Yeah , I think so .\nPhD A: I think they were also mainly , well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , but mainly trying to tune their {disfmarker} their system as it is now to {disfmarker} just trying to get the best from this {disfmarker} this architecture .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor D: OK . So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get {disfmarker} There 'd be some point where you say , \" OK , this is their version - one \" or whatever , and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: and then um , uh , that 's what we work with . We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then um , uh , when it gets to be uh , January some point uh , we say , \" OK we {disfmarker} we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . So now uh {pause} um {pause} what 's your newest version ? \" And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better and then we {disfmarker} we 'd combine it . This is always hard . I mean I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I used to work {pause} with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh , HMM system with uh {disfmarker} with a neural net system and uh , it was {pause} a common problem that you 'd {disfmarker} Oh , and this {disfmarker} Actually , this is true not just for neural nets but just for {disfmarker} in general if people were {pause} working with uh , rescoring uh , N - best lists or lattices that come {disfmarker} came from uh , a mainstream recognizer . Uh , You get something from the {disfmarker} the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . But they 're working really hard , too . So by the time {pause} you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: and now there isn't any difference ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: because the other {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So , um , I guess at some point we 'll have to\nPhD A: So it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker} {comment} Uh , I {disfmarker} I don't know . I think we 're {disfmarker} we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . I think at the moment they {disfmarker} they say that they have a better thing we can {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} e e\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , presumably uh , in a {disfmarker} in a day we could turn around uh , taking a new set of things from them and {disfmarker} and rescoring it ,\nPhD A: Mmm . Yeah . Yeah , perhaps we could .\nProfessor D: right ? So . Yeah . Well , OK . No , this is {disfmarker} I think this is good . I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh , you know , different trainings . You know , da training targets and noises and so forth .\nPhD A: Mmm . So we {disfmarker} we can for {disfmarker} we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps ,\nProfessor D: That 's sort of wide open .\nPhD A: or focus more on the targets and on the training data and {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: Yeah , I think for right now um , I th I {disfmarker} I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties . Um , but um , uh , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . Yeah . I think {pause} we have to start cutting down .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So uh {disfmarker} I think so , yeah . And then , you know , once we {disfmarker} Um , having gone through this {pause} process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about uh , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about MSG?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the professor think about MSG?", "context": "Professor D: OK .\nPhD A: Mike . Mike - one ?\nPhD B: Ah .\nProfessor D: We 're on ? Yes , please . I mean , we 're testing noise robustness but let 's not get silly . OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ?\nPhD A: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: That are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: um .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it .\nProfessor D: Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK .\nPhD B: Ah , yeah .\nProfessor D: Ah .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah .\nPhD B: Uh , do you want @ @ .\nProfessor D: This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: Let 's see . Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal . The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . Um , yeah . Mmm . You know you can {disfmarker} you can comment these results ,\nPhD B: Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , um , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta , uh we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when\nPhD A: Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy .\nPhD B: w Yeah , this {disfmarker} Yeah , this number recognition acc\nPhD A: So it 's not the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Again we switch to another {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yes , and the baseline {disfmarker} the baseline have {disfmarker} i is eighty - two .\nProfessor D: Baseline is eighty - two .\nPhD B: Yeah\nPhD A: So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this .\nProfessor D: Uh , this is Italian mismatched .\nPhD A: Um .\nPhD B: Yeah , by the moment .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD B: And first in the experiment - one I {disfmarker} I do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I use different MLP ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . Um . for the ne {disfmarker} rest of experiment I use multi - English , only multi - English . And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy .\nPhD A: Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: but this is not the case for Italian what {disfmarker} where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So , um {vocalsound} uh , well , I don't think this is a bug but this {disfmarker} this is something in {disfmarker} probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But {disfmarker} that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP .\nProfessor D: I Um , the uh , baseline system {disfmarker} when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: and the training is Italian digits ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and {disfmarker} and , uh microphone and so forth ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: right ? So , um did we have {disfmarker} So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is {disfmarker} is the uh Italian digits ?\nPhD B: The train the training of the HTK ?\nProfessor D: The {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yes . Ah yes !\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD B: This h Yes . Th - Yes .\nProfessor D: Yes . Training of the net ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: yeah . So , um {disfmarker} So what that says is that in a matched condition , {vocalsound} we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . Now w would {disfmarker} do we have a number , I suppose for the matched {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't mean matched , but uh use of Italian {disfmarker} training in Italian digits for PLP only ?\nPhD B: Uh {pause} yes ?\nPhD A: Uh {pause} yeah , so this is {disfmarker} basically this is in the table . Uh {pause} so the number is fifty - two ,\nPhD B: Another table .\nPhD A: uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Fifty - two percent .\nPhD A: Fift - So {disfmarker} No , it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: No .\nProfessor D: No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ?\nPhD A: Of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of uh {pause} eighteen {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Eighty .\nPhD A: of eighteen .\nPhD B: Eighty .\nPhD A: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's error rate , basically .\nPhD B: It 's plus six .\nPhD A: It 's er error rate ratio . So {disfmarker} \nProfessor D: Oh this is accuracy ! \nPhD A: Uh , so we have nine {disfmarker} nine {disfmarker} let 's say ninety percent .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oy ! {comment} OK . Ninety .\nPhD A: Yeah . Um {comment} which is uh {comment} what we have also if use PLP and MSG together ,\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: eighty - nine point seven .\nProfessor D: OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition {disfmarker} Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping .\nPhD A: Uh . P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same {disfmarker} same results .\nProfessor D: Same result pretty much ?\nPhD A: Well , we have these results . I don't know . It 's not {disfmarker} Do you have this result with PLP alone , {comment} j fee feeding HTK ?\nProfessor D: So , s\nPhD A: That {disfmarker} That 's what you mean ?\nPhD B: Yeah ,\nPhD A: Just PLP at the input of HTK .\nPhD B: yeah yeah yeah yeah , at the first {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . So , PLP {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Eighty - eight point six .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um , so adding MSG\nPhD A: Um {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: um {disfmarker} Well , but that 's {disfmarker} yeah , that 's without the neural net ,\nPhD A: Yeah , that 's without the neural net\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD A: and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization .\nProfessor D: But she had said eighty - two .\nPhD A: This is the {disfmarker} w well , but this is without on - line normalization .\nProfessor D: Right ? Oh , this {disfmarker} the eighty - two .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: \nPhD A: Eighty - two is the {disfmarker} it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use {disfmarker} well , OGI , they use MFCC {disfmarker} th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization\nProfessor D: Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy .\nPhD A: Yeah , sorry . Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Alright . So this is {disfmarker} I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better\nPhD B: Yes , better .\nProfessor D: because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead .\nPhD A: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent .\nPhD B: Nnn , we don't know exactly .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} whatever the normalization , actually . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to {disfmarker} to ninety , or something .\nPhD A: Well , ninety {disfmarker} No , I {disfmarker} I mean ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight .\nProfessor D: Eighty - nine .\nPhD A: Well , there are minor {disfmarker} minor differences .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically .\nPhD A: No .\nProfessor D: Yeah . OK .\nPhD A: Uh For Italian , yeah .\nProfessor D: For this case , right ?\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: Alright . So , um {disfmarker} So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you {disfmarker} uh does not help in that case .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker}\nPhD A:  But w Yeah .\nProfessor D: The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but {disfmarker} And the multi - English , does uh {disfmarker} So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um {pause} and {pause} we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net .\nPhD A: Yeah\nProfessor D: And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things .\nPhD A: No .\nProfessor D: And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error . Uh {pause} no , not quite that , is it . Uh , two point six out of eighteen . About , um {pause} sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Not matching condition , but uh , the uh , Italian training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: We select these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these tasks because it 's the more difficult .\nProfessor D: Yes , good . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching , uh , data for the {disfmarker} uh for the new {disfmarker} for the other languages and so forth . Um , one qu thing is that , uh {disfmarker} I think I asked you this before , but I wanna double check . When you say \" ME \" in these other tests , that 's the multi - English ,\nPhD A: That 's {disfmarker} it 's a part {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of {disfmarker} part of it .\nPhD A: Or , one million frames .\nProfessor D: And the multi - English is how much ?\nPhD B: You have here the information .\nPhD A: It 's one million and a half . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: you think . So , it it 's still {disfmarker} it hurts you {disfmarker} seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I wonder why Yeah . Uh .\nGrad C: Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled ,\nPhD A: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: the French and the Spanish .\nPhD B: The Spanish . Maybe for that .\nProfessor D: Hmm .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: It 's still {disfmarker} OK . Alright , go ahead . And then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Um . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I {disfmarker} first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature {disfmarker} another feature .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And we s we can {disfmarker} first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta {disfmarker} PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Maybe if {disfmarker} when we have the new {disfmarker} the new {pause} neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . I don't know .\nPhD A: Actually , just to be some more {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the\nProfessor D: Yes , yeah , I mean it can't be compared with the other\nPhD A: Which number ?\nProfessor D: cuz this is , uh {disfmarker} with multi - English , uh , training .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that , uh the eighty - four point six .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Right ?\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: So {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: and straight features with delta - delta . And straight features with delta - delta gives you what 's on the first sheet .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Not t not\nPhD A: It 's eight eighty - eight point six .\nProfessor D: tr No . No . No .\nPhD B: Yes .\nProfessor D: Not trained with multi - English .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah , but th this is the second configuration .\nPhD B: No , but they {disfmarker} they feature @ @ without {disfmarker}\nPhD A: So we use feature out uh , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not {disfmarker} perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features .\nProfessor D: Eh . {comment} Oh , I see . Ah . So you 're saying w so asking the question , \" What {disfmarker} what has adding the MLP done to improve over the ,\nPhD A: So , just {disfmarker} Yeah so , actually it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it decreased the {disfmarker} the accuracy .\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: Because we have eighty - eight point six .\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: And even the MLP alone {disfmarker} What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . Oh no , it gives eighty - three point six . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six ,\nPhD B: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: that gives eighty - seven point one .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty {disfmarker} eighty - eight point six .\nPhD A: Eighty - three point six . Eighty {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Is th is that right ? Yeah ?\nPhD B: Yeah . But {disfmarker} I don't know {disfmarker} but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP {pause} delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help .\nPhD A: Perhaps , yeah .\nProfessor D: Well , that 's {disfmarker} that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that , um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's {disfmarker} let 's consider what that means . What {disfmarker} what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that {disfmarker} I mean my interpretation of your {disfmarker} your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And , um , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it {disfmarker} when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad .\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh {disfmarker} on say digits ,\nPhD A: On TI - digits ? OK .\nProfessor D: you know , d Was that experiment done ?\nPhD A: No , not yet .\nProfessor D: Yeah , OK . Uh , then does that , eh {disfmarker} you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , {comment} does it {disfmarker} does it then look much better ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh {disfmarker} of tests ? So , an anyway . OK , go ahead .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , uh , d I have found more or less the same result .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So , it 's slightly better ,\nPhD B: Little bit better ?\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: Slightly better .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Slightly bet better . Yes , is better .\nProfessor D: And {disfmarker} and you know again maybe if you use the , uh , delta {pause} there , uh , you would bring it up to where it was , uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case .\nPhD B: Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Maybe .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Well , so perhaps let 's {disfmarker} let 's jump at the last experiment .\nPhD B:  Oh , yeah .\nProfessor D: So .\nPhD A: It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output .\nPhD B: i\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: It 's again better . So it 's eighty - nine point {disfmarker} point one .\nPhD B: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and we have only forty {disfmarker} forty feature\nPhD A: So .\nPhD B: because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , uh , doesn't work {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD B: uh , well , work , but is better , the second configuration . Because I {disfmarker} for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one .\nProfessor D: Um , by the way , there is a another , uh , suggestion that would apply , uh , to the second configuration , um , which , uh , was made , uh , by , uh , Hari . And that was that , um , if you have {disfmarker} uh feed two streams into HTK , um , and you , uh , change the , uh variances {disfmarker} if you scale the variances associated with , uh these streams um , you can effectively scale {pause} the streams . Right ? So , um , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , which is the rule here , uh , you can still change the variances\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: which would effectively change the scale of these {disfmarker} these , uh , two streams that come in .\nPhD A: Uh , {comment} yeah .\nProfessor D: And , um , so , um , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , um , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And , um , so this is just setting them to be , excuse me , of equal {disfmarker} equal weight . Maybe it shouldn't be equal weight .\nPhD B: Maybe .\nProfessor D: Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , but {disfmarker} but , uh , um , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: It 's not even the HTK ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: uh , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Well , I guess you have to do the HTK training also .\nPhD B: so this is what we decided to do .\nProfessor D: Uh , do you ? Let me think . Maybe you don't . Uh . Yeah , you have to change the {disfmarker} No , you can just do it in {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} once you 've done the training {disfmarker}\nGrad C: And then you can vary it . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could {disfmarker} you could just scale them all .\nPhD A: Scale\nProfessor D: Variances .\nPhD A: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Is it {disfmarker} i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances , so I d Is it {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: That 's uh , exactly the point , I think , that if you change {disfmarker} um , change what they are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: It 's diagonal covariance matrices , but you say what those variances are .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So , that {disfmarker} you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna {disfmarker} it 's gonna {disfmarker} it 's gonna internally multiply it {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh , {vocalsound} uh , i it im uh implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the {disfmarker} change the variances {pause} of some of the features .\nPhD A: Mmm . Mmm .\nPhD B: do ?\nProfessor D: So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , uh , the s the strength that you apply the features . That was {disfmarker} that was , uh , Hari 's suggestion .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: So , um {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So . So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just {disfmarker} just not the right thing to do . Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms because , you know , maybe it should be a different {vocalsound} number for {disfmarker} for each {vocalsound} kind of {pause} test set , or something ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So I guess the other thing is to take {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} if one were to take , uh , you know , a couple of the most successful of these ,\nPhD A: Yeah , and test across everything .\nProfessor D: and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , try all these different tests .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Alright . Uh .\nPhD A: So , the next point , yeah , we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , um , about their um , uh , articulatory stuff , um . So we 'll perhaps start something next week .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Um , discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our {disfmarker} our networks with their {disfmarker} within their block diagram , uh , where to plug in the {disfmarker} the network , uh , after the {disfmarker} the feature , before as um a as a plugin or as a anoth another path , discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , um , actually Hynek would like to see , perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , uh , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band . And he would like to replace these by a network which would , uh , make the system look like a TRAP . Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system . Basically , this is a TRAP system {disfmarker} kind of TRAP system , I mean , but where the neural network are replaced by LDA . Hmm . {vocalsound} Um , yeah , and about multi - band , uh , I started multi - band MLP trainings , um mmh {comment} Actually , I w I w hhh {comment} prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything . And , mmm , I 'm starting to train also , networks with larger contexts . So , this would {disfmarker} would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and {disfmarker} but with a lot of context also . So Um Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages . For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything . So . Now we can test these two networks on {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with delta and large networks . Well , test them also on Finnish\nPhD B: Mmm .\nPhD A: and see which one is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the best . Uh , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what {disfmarker} everything that has been done . So . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one , two , three , four , uh , three , four , five , six , seven ten {disfmarker} on ten different databases .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , the number of frames is bad also , so we have one million and a half for some , three million for other , and six million for the last one . Uh , yeah ! {comment} As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled , and perhaps this is what makes the difference . Um . Yeah , the other are just Viterbi - aligned . So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things . First , um with respect to the on - line normalization , there are {disfmarker} that use bad on - line normalization , and other good on - line normalization . Um . With respect to the features , with respect to the use of delta or no , uh with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets . Uh , but of course we don't have all the combination of these different parameters Um . s What 's this ? We only have two hundred eighty six different tests And no not two thousand .\nProfessor D:  Ugh ! I was impressed boy , two thousand .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Ah , yes .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD B: I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , OK .\nPhD A: Um . Yeah , basically the observation is what we discussed already . The MSG problem , um , the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate . but when the M - MLP is trained on the um {disfmarker} is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features . Except if the features are bad {disfmarker} uh , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized . In this case the tandem is still better even if it 's trained on {disfmarker} not on the target digits .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So it sounds like {vocalsound} yeah , the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: But if you can do good normalization it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh , so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better {disfmarker} the best network .\nProfessor D: So So - Let me {disfmarker} bef before you go on to the possible issues .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So , on the MSG uh problem um , I think that in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} um , in the short {pause} time {pause} solution um , that is , um , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: uh , much as I said with JRASTA , even though I really like JRASTA and I really like MSG ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it {disfmarker} it may be complicated .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: And uh it might be {disfmarker} if someone 's interested in it , uh , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term , once we get out of this particular rush {pause} uh for results .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: But in the short term , unless you have some {disfmarker} some s strong idea of what 's wrong ,\nPhD A: I don't know at all but I 've {disfmarker} perhaps {disfmarker} I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite {disfmarker} quite simple or just like nnn , no high - pass filter\nProfessor D: Yeah , probably .\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} Mmm . Yeah . {pause} My {disfmarker} But I don't know .\nProfessor D: There 's supposed to {disfmarker} well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though , right ?\nPhD A: It 's {disfmarker} There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be uh , yeah ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: taking out means and variances and so forth . So .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design ,\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah . But this was the bad on - line normalization . Actually . Uh . Are your results are still with the bad {disfmarker} the bad {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Maybe , may {disfmarker} No ? With the better {disfmarker}\nPhD A: With the O - OLN - two ?\nPhD B: No ?\nPhD A: Ah yeah , you have {disfmarker} you have OLN - two ,\nPhD B: Oh ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! With \" two \" , with \" on - line - two \" .\nPhD A: yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah ,\nProfessor D: \" On - line - two \" is good .\nPhD A: So it 's , is the good yeah .\nPhD B: yeah . Yep , it 's a good .\nProfessor D: \" Two \" is good ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: No , \" two \" is bad .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Well , actually , it 's good with the ch with the good .\nProfessor D: OK . Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah , I {disfmarker} I agree . It 's probably something simple uh , i if {disfmarker} if uh someone , you know , uh , wants to play with it for a little bit . I mean , you 're gonna do what you 're gonna do\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker} but my {disfmarker} my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mmm . I see , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh . {comment} And the other {disfmarker} the results uh , observations two and three , Um , is\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's pretty much what we 've seen . That 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task {disfmarker} If it 's on the target task then it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it helps to have the MLP transforming it .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: If it uh {disfmarker} if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is , uh you can get uh , a reduction in performance .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And the question is now how to {disfmarker} how to get one and not the other ? Or how to {disfmarker} how to ameliorate the {disfmarker} the problems .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Um , because it {disfmarker} it certainly does {disfmarker} is nice to have in there , when it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} when there is something like the training data .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . Um . Yeah . So , {pause} the {disfmarker} the reason {disfmarker} Yeah , the reason is that the {disfmarker} perhaps the target {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the task dependency {disfmarker} the language dependency , {vocalsound} and the noise dependency {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So that 's what you say th there . I see .\nPhD A: Well , the e e But this is still not clear because , um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think we have enough result to talk about the {disfmarker} the language dependency . Well , the TIMIT network is still the best but there is also an the other difference , the fact that it 's {disfmarker} it 's hand - labeled .\nProfessor D: Hey ! Um , just {disfmarker} you can just sit here . Uh , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones but it 's uh {disfmarker} Just uh , have a seat . Um . s Summary of the first uh , uh forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and {disfmarker} works , and some stuff doesn't OK ,\nPhD A: We still have uh {pause} this {disfmarker} One of these perhaps ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think if you {disfmarker} if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words and then th that has it the {pause} associated results .\nPhD B: Um .\nProfessor D: OK . So you 're saying that um , um , although from what we see , yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , uh , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing . But you 're saying that uh , it is {disfmarker} Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about . And {disfmarker} and what is that ? I mean , you say \" not clear yet \" . What {disfmarker} what do you mean ?\nPhD A: Uh , mmm , uh , {comment} I mean , that the {disfmarker} the fact that s Well , for {disfmarker} for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best ,  which is the English net .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: But the other are slightly worse . But you have two {disfmarker} two effects , the effect of changing language and the effect of training on something that 's {pause} Viterbi - aligned instead of hand {disfmarker} hand - labeled .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: So . Um . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Do you think the alignments are bad ? I mean , have you looked at the alignments at all ? What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ?\nPhD A: Mmm . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know . Did - did you look at the Spanish alignments Carmen ?\nPhD B: Mmm , no .\nProfessor D: Might be interesting to look at it . Because , I mean , that is just looking but um , um {disfmarker} It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment . It depends how good the recognizer is\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the engine is that 's doing the alignment .\nPhD A: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . But , perhaps it 's not really the {disfmarker} the alignment that 's bad but the {disfmarker} just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment\nProfessor D: Aha !\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah . \nProfessor D: The pronunciation models and so forth\nPhD A: I mean {pause} for {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} It 's single pronunciation , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Aha .\nPhD A: French {disfmarker} French s uh , phoneme strings were corrected manually\nProfessor D: I see .\nPhD A: so we asked people to listen to the um {disfmarker} the sentence and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them . But still ,  there {disfmarker} there might be errors just in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the ph string of phonemes . Mmm . Um . Yeah , so this is not really the Viterbi alignment ,  in fact , yeah . Um , the third {disfmarker} The third uh issue is the noise dependency perhaps but , well , this is not clear yet because all our nets are trained on the same noises and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . So it {disfmarker} And that has other noise .\nPhD A: Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . Results are only coming for {disfmarker} for this net . Mmm .\nProfessor D: OK , yeah , just don't {disfmarker} just need more {disfmarker} more results there with that @ @ .\nPhD A: Yeah . Um . So . Uh , from these results we have some questions with answers . What should be the network input ? Um , PLP work as well as MFCC , I mean . Um . But it seems impor important to use the delta . Uh , with respect to the network size , there 's one experiment that 's still running and we should have the result today , comparing network with five hundred and {pause} one thousand units . So , nnn , still no answer actually .\nProfessor D: Hm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , the training set , well , some kind of answer . We can , we can tell which training set gives the best result , but {vocalsound} we don't know exactly why . Uh , so .\nProfessor D: Uh . Right , I mean the multi - English so far is {disfmarker} is the best .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: \" Multi - multi - English \" just means \" TIMIT \" ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So uh That 's {disfmarker} Yeah . So . And {disfmarker} and when you add other things in to {disfmarker} to broaden it , it gets worse {pause} uh typically .\nPhD A: Mmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Then uh some questions without answers .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Uh , training set , um ,\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: uh , training targets {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I like that . The training set is both questions , with answers and without answers .\nPhD A: It 's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: It 's sort of , yes {disfmarker} it 's mul it 's multi - uh - purpose .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Uh , training s Right . So {disfmarker} Yeah , the training targets actually , the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency {vocalsound} and the noise dependency . And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And labeling s labeling seems important uh , because of TIMIT results .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh . For moment you use {disfmarker} we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even , um use networks that doesn't do classification but just regression so uh , train to have neural networks that um , um , uh ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: does a regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . I mean uh , transform the fea noisy features {vocalsound} in other features that are not noisy . But continuous features . Not uh uh , hard targets .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah , that {pause} seems like a good thing to do , probably ,  not uh again a short - term sort of thing .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I mean one of the things about that is that um it 's {disfmarker} e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being {disfmarker} is being dependent on {disfmarker} very dependent on the kind of noise and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nPhD A: Yeah . f But , yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh . But it 's another thing to try .\nPhD A: So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this {disfmarker} this could be {disfmarker} could help {disfmarker} could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database . I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} So this is one {vocalsound} approach and the other is multi - band {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh , features - based targets could {disfmarker} could {disfmarker} could help .\nProfessor D: Yeah , if you {disfmarker} i i It 's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up {disfmarker} I mean w yeah , one {disfmarker} one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have {pause} um some reasonable database , um but then {disfmarker} which is um {vocalsound} copied over many times with a range of different noises ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If {disfmarker} Cuz what you 're trying to {pause} do is come up with a {disfmarker} a core , reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used uh , by the {disfmarker} the uh HMM {pause} system .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , OK .\nPhD A: So , um , yeah . The future work is , {pause} well , try to connect to the {disfmarker} to make {disfmarker} to plug in the system to the OGI system . Um , there are still open questions there , where to put the MLP basically .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: And I guess , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the real open question , I mean , e u there 's lots of open questions , but one of the core quote {comment} \" open questions \" for that is um , um , if we take the uh {disfmarker} you know , the best ones here , maybe not just the best one , but the best few or something {disfmarker} You want the most promising group from these other experiments . Um , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ?\nPhD A: Mmm ,\nProfessor D: Um . And y\nPhD A: Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor D: y {pause} Right ? And then um {disfmarker} then see , {pause} again , how {disfmarker} We know that there 's a mis there 's a uh {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than {disfmarker} than , uh we 're gonna test on , but well , if you look over a range of these different tests um , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features , uh stand up over that range ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: That 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that seems like the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the real question . And if you know that {disfmarker} So if you just take PLP with uh , the double - deltas . Assume that 's the p the feature . look at these different ways of combining it . And uh , take {disfmarker} let 's say , just take uh multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And just look {disfmarker} take that case and then look over all the different things . How does that {disfmarker} How does that compare between the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: So all the {disfmarker} all the test sets you mean , yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: All the different test sets ,\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: and for {disfmarker} and for the couple different ways that you have of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of combining them .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um . {pause} How well do they stand up , over the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mmm . And perhaps doing this for {disfmarker} cha changing the variance of the streams and so on {pause} getting different scaling {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: That 's another possibility if you have time , yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: Um . Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the {disfmarker} to their diagram .\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: Cuz {disfmarker} Yeah . Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn , they {disfmarker} they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates ,\nProfessor D: Yeah . {pause} It 's a little strange\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm ?\nProfessor D: but on the other hand they did it before .\nPhD A: Mmm . And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor D: Um the\nPhD A: yeah . And because also perhaps we know that the {disfmarker} when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help . So . I don't know .\nProfessor D: Um , the other thing , though , is that um {disfmarker} So . Uh , we {disfmarker} we wanna get their path running here , right ? If so , we can add this other stuff .\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: as an additional path right ?\nPhD A: Yeah , the {disfmarker} the way we want to do {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Cuz they 're doing LDA {pause} RASTA .\nPhD A: The d What ?\nProfessor D: They 're doing LDA RASTA ,\nPhD A: Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to {disfmarker} just to get the VAD labels and the final features .\nProfessor D: yeah ?\nPhD A: So they will send us the {disfmarker} Well , provide us with the feature files ,\nProfessor D: I see . I see .\nPhD A: and with VAD uh , binary labels so that we can uh , get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream . So .\nProfessor D: I see . So we {disfmarker} So . First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . Without putting in a second path .\nPhD A: Uh . You mean {disfmarker} Oh , yeah ! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ?\nProfessor D: Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we {pause} have {disfmarker} we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to {disfmarker} is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK .\nPhD A:  Oh yeah . Yeah , OK . Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh , I mean , I don't know that we need to r\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um {pause} Do we need to retrain I mean we can just take the re their training files also . But . {pause} But , uh just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results {pause} so we can duplicate it before we add in another {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mmm . OK .\nProfessor D: Cuz otherwise , you know , we won't know what things mean .\nPhD A: Oh , yeah . OK . And um . Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , I don't know if we want to {disfmarker} We can try {pause} networks with LogRASTA filtered features .\nProfessor D: Maybe .\nPhD A: Mmm . I 'm sorry ? Yeah . Well {disfmarker} Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . {comment} that u Um , uh , when you 're talking about combining multiple features , um {disfmarker} Suppose we said , \" OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , but PLP seems {pause} pretty good . \" If we take the approach that Mike did and have {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: I mean , one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions . We have different languages , we have different {disfmarker} {vocalsound} different noises , Um {pause} If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps {pause} with them .\nPhD A: \nProfessor D: And put {disfmarker} put them together . What {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , I mean {disfmarker} I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . That you did have nice interpolative effects . That is , that yes , if you knew {pause} what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . So it was sort of {disfmarker} behaved reasonably . Is tha that a fair {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . So you {disfmarker} you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: It works better if {pause} what ?\nPhD A: Yea\nProfessor D: I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was {disfmarker} So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh , uh , reverberation . Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f {pause} for this kind of task , I would think , {pause} sort of a modest amount . I mean , a million frames actually isn't that much . We have a modest amount of {disfmarker} of uh training data from a couple different conditions , and then uh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} yeah , that {disfmarker} and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type uh , and uh , {pause} uh , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . A bunch of different dimensions . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have {pause} um , the data to train up {disfmarker} I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in {disfmarker} we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is better . And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another {pause} we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability {pause} to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability {pause} that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm hoping that um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we {disfmarker} if they look at more constrained conditions they {disfmarker} they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD A: So doing both is {disfmarker} is not {disfmarker} is not right , you mean , or {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I just sort of have a feeling {disfmarker}\nPhD A: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i i e The um {disfmarker} I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA {pause} RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the {disfmarker} I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's {disfmarker} it uh {disfmarker} it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . So they did {disfmarker} At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? I mean they {disfmarker} they were not {disfmarker} not using the neural net . Uh I don't know . OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single {disfmarker} Yeah . Make stuff better . OK . Uh . {vocalsound} Yeah . And CPU memory issues . Yeah . We 've been sort of ignoring that , haven't we ?\nPhD A: Yeah , so I don't know .\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah , but I li Well , I think {disfmarker} My impression {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that {vocalsound} uh , there was a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a strict constraint on the delay ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better , and {vocalsound} using less CPU was better . Something like that ,\nPhD A: Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah . So , yeah , but we 've {disfmarker} I don't know . We have to get some reference point to where we {disfmarker} Well , what 's a reasonable number ? Perhaps be because if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's too large or {disfmarker} large or @ @ {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Um , well I don't think we 're {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} completely off the wall . I mean I think that if we {disfmarker} if we have {disfmarker} Uh , I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do {disfmarker} If we find uh {disfmarker} I mean we may find that we {disfmarker} we 're not really gonna worry about the M L You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , uh , we might even have more than one MLP . We could simply say that is uh , done on the uh , server .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And it 's uh {disfmarker} We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that . So , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} {pause} that 's OK .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor D: So I think the key thing was um , this plug into OGI . Um , what {disfmarker} what are they {disfmarker} What are they gonna be working {disfmarker} Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features ,\nPhD A: They 're {disfmarker} They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band .\nProfessor D: and {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: So . Um {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} that was Pratibha . Sunil , what was he doing , do you remember ?\nPhD B: Sunil ?\nPhD A: Yeah . He was doing something new or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I {disfmarker} I don't re I didn't remember . Maybe he 's working with {pause} neural network .\nPhD A: I don't think so . Trying to tune wha networks ?\nPhD B: Yeah , I think so .\nPhD A: I think they were also mainly , well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , but mainly trying to tune their {disfmarker} their system as it is now to {disfmarker} just trying to get the best from this {disfmarker} this architecture .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor D: OK . So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get {disfmarker} There 'd be some point where you say , \" OK , this is their version - one \" or whatever , and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: and then um , uh , that 's what we work with . We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then um , uh , when it gets to be uh , January some point uh , we say , \" OK we {disfmarker} we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . So now uh {pause} um {pause} what 's your newest version ? \" And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better and then we {disfmarker} we 'd combine it . This is always hard . I mean I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I used to work {pause} with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh , HMM system with uh {disfmarker} with a neural net system and uh , it was {pause} a common problem that you 'd {disfmarker} Oh , and this {disfmarker} Actually , this is true not just for neural nets but just for {disfmarker} in general if people were {pause} working with uh , rescoring uh , N - best lists or lattices that come {disfmarker} came from uh , a mainstream recognizer . Uh , You get something from the {disfmarker} the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . But they 're working really hard , too . So by the time {pause} you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: and now there isn't any difference ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: because the other {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So , um , I guess at some point we 'll have to\nPhD A: So it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker} {comment} Uh , I {disfmarker} I don't know . I think we 're {disfmarker} we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . I think at the moment they {disfmarker} they say that they have a better thing we can {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} e e\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , presumably uh , in a {disfmarker} in a day we could turn around uh , taking a new set of things from them and {disfmarker} and rescoring it ,\nPhD A: Mmm . Yeah . Yeah , perhaps we could .\nProfessor D: right ? So . Yeah . Well , OK . No , this is {disfmarker} I think this is good . I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh , you know , different trainings . You know , da training targets and noises and so forth .\nPhD A: Mmm . So we {disfmarker} we can for {disfmarker} we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps ,\nProfessor D: That 's sort of wide open .\nPhD A: or focus more on the targets and on the training data and {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: Yeah , I think for right now um , I th I {disfmarker} I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties . Um , but um , uh , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . Yeah . I think {pause} we have to start cutting down .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So uh {disfmarker} I think so , yeah . And then , you know , once we {disfmarker} Um , having gone through this {pause} process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about uh , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .", "answers": ["The professor generally liked MSG because of its different temporal properties.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nUser Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?\nMarketing: I am the um {disfmarker} I need my notebook , mm ooh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert {vocalsound} um so like I'm gonna be doing the {disfmarker} apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything {disfmarker} the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um so yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: And more about yourself , you're from ?\nMarketing: Um I'm from Leicester ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um second year . Um what else do you want to know ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I like sports {vocalsound} um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: um {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But not with rabbits . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: not with rabbits , no no .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And vets , I like vets as well .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Cool .\nMarketing: Okay ? Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Excellent , to match the rabbit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay .\nProject Manager: There's a {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . {vocalsound} Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um {vocalsound} familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have {disfmarker} shouldn't have said it beforehand but\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: mm {vocalsound} hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's not bad at all .\nProject Manager: Ah it looks like a dog .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yep .\nMarketing: Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} the other legs are on the other side .\nUser Interface: Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh I hope to be loyal to the project\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And where where are you from ?\nUser Interface: I'm from Estonia\nProject Manager: Estonia .\nUser Interface: uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: um so um in the different um {vocalsound} stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for {vocalsound} yeah , designing the technical functions of the um {vocalsound} um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay , that's it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Okay {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I'll do some {disfmarker} I'll rub the features\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and let the drawing stay . {vocalsound} 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um {vocalsound} my favourite animal {disfmarker} one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good luck .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this is going to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that'll do .\nMarketing: and then just some horns .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so let let me draw the body first .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and they've got a long tail\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and a long face . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's eating .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It looks like Eeyore . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And there is some grass there .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So this is what I like about {vocalsound} cows {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Horns ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass ,\nMarketing: draw some horns . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they do not disturb anybody um\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So yeah , I like cows . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thank you .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager: Right , now now it's my turn obviously . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , here's a space .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It looks very very cute .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I like the cow .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: I'm Jen .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I like {disfmarker} Mm .\nMarketing: Is that a lizard ?\nIndustrial Designer: No way . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Wow .\nProject Manager: It's a gecko .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah okay .\nUser Interface: Ah , a gecko , okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Is there a difference ?\nUser Interface: Is {disfmarker} a ar are they also like lizards or are they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They're {disfmarker} Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard .\nUser Interface: yeah , they are\nProject Manager: And I I like geckos\nUser Interface: {disfmarker} mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because they remind me of warm places {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ?\nProject Manager: I don't like snakes . I come from Australia\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .\nUser Interface: Wonderful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . So , I've just thought {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you right click on it you can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally {vocalsound} as {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We've got {disfmarker} um we're planning to sell these remote controls for {disfmarker} let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Marketing think of buttons when discussing the functional design of the remote control?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the Marketing think of buttons when discussing the functional design of the remote control?", "context": "User Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?\nMarketing: I am the um {disfmarker} I need my notebook , mm ooh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert {vocalsound} um so like I'm gonna be doing the {disfmarker} apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything {disfmarker} the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um so yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: And more about yourself , you're from ?\nMarketing: Um I'm from Leicester ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um second year . Um what else do you want to know ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I like sports {vocalsound} um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: um {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But not with rabbits . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: not with rabbits , no no .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And vets , I like vets as well .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Cool .\nMarketing: Okay ? Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Excellent , to match the rabbit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay .\nProject Manager: There's a {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . {vocalsound} Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um {vocalsound} familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have {disfmarker} shouldn't have said it beforehand but\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: mm {vocalsound} hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's not bad at all .\nProject Manager: Ah it looks like a dog .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yep .\nMarketing: Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} the other legs are on the other side .\nUser Interface: Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh I hope to be loyal to the project\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And where where are you from ?\nUser Interface: I'm from Estonia\nProject Manager: Estonia .\nUser Interface: uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: um so um in the different um {vocalsound} stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for {vocalsound} yeah , designing the technical functions of the um {vocalsound} um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay , that's it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Okay {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I'll do some {disfmarker} I'll rub the features\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and let the drawing stay . {vocalsound} 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um {vocalsound} my favourite animal {disfmarker} one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good luck .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this is going to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that'll do .\nMarketing: and then just some horns .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so let let me draw the body first .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and they've got a long tail\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and a long face . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's eating .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It looks like Eeyore . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And there is some grass there .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So this is what I like about {vocalsound} cows {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Horns ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass ,\nMarketing: draw some horns . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they do not disturb anybody um\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So yeah , I like cows . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thank you .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager: Right , now now it's my turn obviously . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , here's a space .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It looks very very cute .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I like the cow .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: I'm Jen .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I like {disfmarker} Mm .\nMarketing: Is that a lizard ?\nIndustrial Designer: No way . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Wow .\nProject Manager: It's a gecko .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah okay .\nUser Interface: Ah , a gecko , okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Is there a difference ?\nUser Interface: Is {disfmarker} a ar are they also like lizards or are they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They're {disfmarker} Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard .\nUser Interface: yeah , they are\nProject Manager: And I I like geckos\nUser Interface: {disfmarker} mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because they remind me of warm places {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ?\nProject Manager: I don't like snakes . I come from Australia\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .\nUser Interface: Wonderful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation .

So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ?

Radio two . Hmm . Radio two .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: Wow .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Hi ?\nPhD B: Blow into it , it works really well .\nGrad F: Channel B .\nProfessor A: People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .\nPhD D: Channel four . Test .\nPhD C: Uh - oh .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD C: Radio four .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: So everybody everybody 's on ?\nPhD D: Today 's\nProfessor A: Yeah . So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfmarker} and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that {vocalsound} you were sort of waiting for them to {vocalsound} tell you that they had something for you and {disfmarker} and that {disfmarker} and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: and {vocalsound} they were sort of waiting for you and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh we ended up with this thing where they {disfmarker} they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that . So . Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean it 's true that maybe {disfmarker} maybe no one really thought about that {disfmarker} that this latency thing would be such a {disfmarker} a strict issue\nPhD C: Yeah . Well , but . Yeah . Yeah . Well {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker} the other {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's also so uh the time constraints . Because , {vocalsound} well , we discussed about that {disfmarker} about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and\nProfessor A: Then they couldn't . I see .\nPhD C: uh yeah . But there was also problem {disfmarker} perhaps a problem of communication . So , yeah . Now we will try to {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Just talk more .\nPhD C: Yeah , slikes and send mails .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: u s o o Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh . OK .\nProfessor A: So there 's um {disfmarker} Alright . Well maybe we should just uh I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the {disfmarker} all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this {disfmarker} machines are busy and {vocalsound} you 're busy\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: and\nPhD C: Basically .\nProfessor A: Yeah . OK . Oh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Let 's {disfmarker} let 's , I mean , I think that as {disfmarker} as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there {disfmarker} there will be {vocalsound} uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that {vocalsound} it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's {vocalsound} approach or something and {vocalsound} in addition to {disfmarker} They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ?\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . So yeah we 're {disfmarker} will start to do this also .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson {disfmarker} Ericsson code .\nPhD D: Yeah . We modif\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And\nPhD D: Yeah , I modified it {disfmarker} well , modifying {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . and we have some {disfmarker} the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: But we haven't result until this moment .\nProfessor A: Yeah , sure .\nPhD D: But well , we are working in this also\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD D: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that it 's in process or that you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it finished and it didn't get a good result ?\nPhD D: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature {disfmarker} the feature but the experiment have\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD D: we have not make the experiment\nProfessor A: Oh . OK .\nPhD D: and maybe will be good result or bad result , we don't know .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK . So um I suggest actually now we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sorta move on and {disfmarker} and hear what 's {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening in {disfmarker} in other areas like {vocalsound} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening with your {vocalsound} investigations {vocalsound} about echos and so on .\nGrad F: Oh um Well um I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Uh {vocalsound} I also um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for {disfmarker} for the {disfmarker} for his code yet . Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and {vocalsound} I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it sounded like um {vocalsound} the channel normalization part {vocalsound} um of his thesis um {vocalsound} was done in a {disfmarker} a bit of I don't know what the word is , a {disfmarker} a bit of a rough way um {vocalsound} it sounded like he um he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was {vocalsound} interesting for the test situation but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it 's {vocalsound} what I 'd wanna use so I have to {disfmarker} I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet .\nProfessor A: OK . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again ,\nPhD D: It 's my\nPhD C: Oh yeah ?\nPhD D: I know this is mine here .\nProfessor A: so . OK . Um . {vocalsound} The um {disfmarker} so you , and then {vocalsound} you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the {disfmarker} the close mounted and the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts between the distant {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Uh I I 'm ho Right . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or I 'm hoping {disfmarker} I 'm hoping Espen will do it .\nProfessor A: Ah ! OK .\nGrad F: Um\nProfessor A: F um\nGrad F: u\nProfessor A: Delegate . That 's good . It 's good to delegate .\nGrad F: I {disfmarker} I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it .\nProfessor A: Great . Great . Yeah actually um he should uh I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . Um . {vocalsound} One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner {vocalsound} close - miked recordings . So uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close {disfmarker} close - miked uh cases um we 'd like to be able to have {vocalsound} um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from {disfmarker} So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be {disfmarker} So {vocalsound} what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but {vocalsound} uh just um uh taking the input from other mikes and using uh {vocalsound} uh a uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . So . Um what was it , there was {disfmarker} there was some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some point where {vocalsound} eh uh Eric or somebody was {disfmarker} was speaking and he had lots of {vocalsound} silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh {vocalsound} which was in the background and it was not {disfmarker} it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech {vocalsound} on the close {disfmarker} {vocalsound} close mike .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD B: Oh the {disfmarker} What we talked about yesterday ?\nProfessor A: Yes .\nPhD B: Yeah that was actually my {disfmarker} I was wearing the {disfmarker} I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,\nProfessor A: Oh you {disfmarker} it was you I was Yeah .\nPhD B: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that {disfmarker} mmm uh {disfmarker} that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out . So I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that . So . OK . Right ? Um . {vocalsound} And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the {disfmarker} the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but {vocalsound} maybe just a quick reprise of {disfmarker} of what we were saying this morning .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor A: Uh .\nGrad E: Um . {comment} So continuing to um extend\nPhD B: What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? And {disfmarker} and S Shawn , yeah . Oh . So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? I see .\nProfessor A: But that 's uh uh all {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} is a {disfmarker} a certainly relevant {comment} {vocalsound} uh study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . We have this problem with the overloading of the term \" feature \" so\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: uh {vocalsound} what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found {disfmarker} finding useful\nPhD C: Hmm .\nProfessor A: um for {disfmarker}\nPhD B: And their {disfmarker} their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features .\nProfessor A: Right . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nGrad E: Oh yeah .\nProfessor A: There 's those {vocalsound} {pause} that uh yeah , some of {disfmarker} some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on {disfmarker} on uh {vocalsound} what \" good features \" are and {disfmarker}\nPhD B: What does {disfmarker} what did um Larry Saul use for {disfmarker} it was the sonorant uh detector , right ? How did he {disfmarker} H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . So how did he combine all these features ? What {disfmarker} what r mmm classifier did he Hmm . Oh right . You were talking about that , yeah . I see .\nProfessor A: And the other thing you were talking about is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is where we get the targets from . So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the {disfmarker} what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels {vocalsound} from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this {disfmarker} this database ? This is the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Hmm !\nProfessor A: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah .\nPhD B: Pierced tongues and Yeah . You could just mount it to that and they wouldn't even notice . Weld it . Zzz .\nProfessor A: Maybe you could go to these parlors and {disfmarker} and you could , you know {disfmarker} you know have {disfmarker} have , you know , reduced rates if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you can do the measurements .\nPhD B: Yeah . I That 's right . You could {disfmarker} what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah , be cool and help science .\nPhD B: and Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD B: Hmm ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that {disfmarker} people have done studies like that w way way back right ? I mean {vocalsound} I can't remember where {disfmarker} uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of {disfmarker} Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ? Um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . I can't remember what his name was . Dang . Now I 'll think of it . That 's interesting .\nProfessor A: Do you mean eh {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} Mar\nPhD C: Well he was the guy {disfmarker} the guy that was using {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: you mean when was {disfmarker} was Mark Randolph there , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: Mark Randolph .\nProfessor A: Yeah he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's at Motorola now .\nPhD B: Oh is he ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know {disfmarker} I just remember it had to do with you know {vocalsound} uh positional parameters\nPhD C: What {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD B: and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So the only {disfmarker} the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {vocalsound} continuous variables and a bunch of them . And so\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there {disfmarker} What you really want are these binary {pause} labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas um {vocalsound} if you did something instead that {disfmarker} like um having some manual annotation by {vocalsound} uh you know , linguistics students , this would {disfmarker} there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with {disfmarker} with John before\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And then there would {disfmarker} it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable . Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables . So . I mean the other thing you could do is {vocalsound} boot trying to {disfmarker} to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from {vocalsound} uh the uh {vocalsound} uh the data itself there , but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Could you cluster the {disfmarker} just do some kind of clustering ?\nProfessor A: Guess you could , yeah .\nPhD B: Bin them up into different categories and {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Yeah . So anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} I mean in general it 's gonna be {disfmarker} for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to {vocalsound} wear the pellets and {disfmarker} Um . So .\nGrad E: Right . Right .\nPhD B: So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD B: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the true mappings are for each phone ?\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: I see .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in {disfmarker} in my mind , I guess , is that um {vocalsound} we 're looking at different ways that we can combine {vocalsound} uh different kinds of {disfmarker} of rep front - end representations {vocalsound} um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from {vocalsound} uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have {vocalsound} a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that {vocalsound} to change some of the other methods we have , since {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that {disfmarker} that it {disfmarker} it um {disfmarker} the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a {disfmarker} a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than {vocalsound} um just assuming {vocalsound} that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength {vocalsound} towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it {disfmarker} so um {vocalsound} he 's got these um uh uh\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: he \" AND 's \" between these different {vocalsound} features . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in {disfmarker} in principle {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different {disfmarker} soft \" OR 's \" across the different uh {vocalsound} multi - band channels . And um {vocalsound} the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" {disfmarker} \" AND ' ed \" things {vocalsound} is something that 's kept {vocalsound} uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is {disfmarker} is uh {vocalsound} taking {vocalsound} the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nPhD B: So he doesn't have {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: which means that it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's uh i It could be for instance {vocalsound} that for a particular point in the data {vocalsound} you don't want to um uh train a particular band {disfmarker} train the detectors for a particular band . You {disfmarker} you wanna ignore {vocalsound} that band , cuz that 's a {disfmarker} Ban - band is a noisy {disfmarker} noisy measure .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And we don't {disfmarker} We 're {disfmarker} we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well {disfmarker} well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .\nPhD B: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or {disfmarker} Ho\nGrad E: F right , and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels .\nProfessor A: Well at the {disfmarker} at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's {disfmarker} where it 's sonorant . But he 's {disfmarker} but what he 's - but what he 's not training up {disfmarker} uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\nGrad E: Right . For the full band .\nProfessor A: um I guess one way of describing would be if {disfmarker} if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ?\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor A: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . OK .\nProfessor A: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band {vocalsound} towards making your decision . And um {vocalsound} uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should {disfmarker} you should use everything {vocalsound} uh with {disfmarker} with uh equal strength .\nPhD B: I see .\nProfessor A: And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had {vocalsound} uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the {disfmarker} if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from {disfmarker} from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: So where did he get his {disfmarker} uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ?\nGrad E: From uh canonical mappings {comment} um at first\nPhD B: OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: and then it 's unclear um eh\nPhD B: Using TIMIT ? or using {disfmarker}\nGrad E: using TIMIT\nPhD B: Uh - huh .\nGrad E: right , right .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah . I mean we ha we have a kind of {vocalsound} iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this {disfmarker} cuz then whatever {vocalsound} that alignment is , it 's that for all {disfmarker} all bands .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate {disfmarker} tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . Um . But it 's still {vocalsound} not quite the same because then it 's {disfmarker} it 's um setting targets based on where you would say {vocalsound} the sound begins in a particular band . Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . Might be closer I guess if we did a {vocalsound} soft {disfmarker} soft target uh {vocalsound} uh embedded {vocalsound} neural net training like we 've done a few times uh {vocalsound} f the forward um {disfmarker} do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . Mmm . Uh what 's next ?\nPhD B: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with .\nProfessor A: Oh . You 're playing ?\nPhD B: I um Huh ?\nProfessor A: You 're playing ?\nPhD B: Yes , I 'm playing . Um {vocalsound} so I wanted to do this experiment to see um {vocalsound} uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um {disfmarker} I think I sent around last week a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where {vocalsound} I would take the um {disfmarker} the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for {vocalsound} the ICSI - OGI front - end .\nProfessor A: What {disfmarker} which test set was this ?\nPhD B: This is {disfmarker} that I looked at ?\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh {vocalsound} been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK {vocalsound} system for the Italian data and got the same results that um {disfmarker} that uh {vocalsound} Stephane had . So um I started looking {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} and now I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to {disfmarker} uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use {vocalsound} the same number of states for all of the models\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a {disfmarker} an HMM system is that you use {vocalsound} um three states per phone and um {vocalsound} so then the {disfmarker} the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . {vocalsound} Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use {vocalsound} uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five {vocalsound} which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} but for the {disfmarker} most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So {vocalsound} my guess {disfmarker} uh And then if you {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I printed out a confusion matrix um {vocalsound} uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that {vocalsound} you know , if you assume a fixed {disfmarker} the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh you 've got {disfmarker} you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So {vocalsound} it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's {disfmarker} because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific {vocalsound} um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the {disfmarker} for the longer word ,\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but .\nPhD B: Yeah so I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create {vocalsound} uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um {disfmarker} how these models were coming out , you know , what w {vocalsound} when we train up uh th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the {disfmarker} uh what do the transition probabilities look like {disfmarker} in the self - loops , {comment} look like in {disfmarker} in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can {vocalsound} calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did {disfmarker} quickly , I did the silence model and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the {vocalsound} string of digits .\nProfessor A: Wow . Lots of silence .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I {disfmarker} I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically {disfmarker} their {disfmarker} {vocalsound} their model for a whole digit string is silence {vocalsound} digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so .\nProfessor A: Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ?\nPhD B: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD B: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own {disfmarker} um It doesn't require its own training data ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: it just shares that state .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know {vocalsound} how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the {disfmarker} the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of {disfmarker} just from looking at the {vocalsound} durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about clustering?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the professor think about clustering?", "context": "Professor A:  Am I on ? I guess so . Radio two . Hmm . Radio two .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: Wow .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Hi ?\nPhD B: Blow into it , it works really well .\nGrad F: Channel B .\nProfessor A: People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .\nPhD D: Channel four . Test .\nPhD C: Uh - oh .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD C: Radio four .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: So everybody everybody 's on ?\nPhD D: Today 's\nProfessor A: Yeah . So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfmarker} and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that {vocalsound} you were sort of waiting for them to {vocalsound} tell you that they had something for you and {disfmarker} and that {disfmarker} and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: and {vocalsound} they were sort of waiting for you and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh we ended up with this thing where they {disfmarker} they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that . So . Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean it 's true that maybe {disfmarker} maybe no one really thought about that {disfmarker} that this latency thing would be such a {disfmarker} a strict issue\nPhD C: Yeah . Well , but . Yeah . Yeah . Well {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker} the other {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's also so uh the time constraints . Because , {vocalsound} well , we discussed about that {disfmarker} about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and\nProfessor A: Then they couldn't . I see .\nPhD C: uh yeah . But there was also problem {disfmarker} perhaps a problem of communication . So , yeah . Now we will try to {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Just talk more .\nPhD C: Yeah , slikes and send mails .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: u s o o Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh . OK .\nProfessor A: So there 's um {disfmarker} Alright . Well maybe we should just uh I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the {disfmarker} all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this {disfmarker} machines are busy and {vocalsound} you 're busy\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: and\nPhD C: Basically .\nProfessor A: Yeah . OK . Oh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Let 's {disfmarker} let 's , I mean , I think that as {disfmarker} as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there {disfmarker} there will be {vocalsound} uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that {vocalsound} it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's {vocalsound} approach or something and {vocalsound} in addition to {disfmarker} They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ?\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . So yeah we 're {disfmarker} will start to do this also .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson {disfmarker} Ericsson code .\nPhD D: Yeah . We modif\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And\nPhD D: Yeah , I modified it {disfmarker} well , modifying {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . and we have some {disfmarker} the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: But we haven't result until this moment .\nProfessor A: Yeah , sure .\nPhD D: But well , we are working in this also\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD D: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that it 's in process or that you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it finished and it didn't get a good result ?\nPhD D: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature {disfmarker} the feature but the experiment have\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD D: we have not make the experiment\nProfessor A: Oh . OK .\nPhD D: and maybe will be good result or bad result , we don't know .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK . So um I suggest actually now we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sorta move on and {disfmarker} and hear what 's {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening in {disfmarker} in other areas like {vocalsound} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening with your {vocalsound} investigations {vocalsound} about echos and so on .\nGrad F: Oh um Well um I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Uh {vocalsound} I also um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for {disfmarker} for the {disfmarker} for his code yet . Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and {vocalsound} I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it sounded like um {vocalsound} the channel normalization part {vocalsound} um of his thesis um {vocalsound} was done in a {disfmarker} a bit of I don't know what the word is , a {disfmarker} a bit of a rough way um {vocalsound} it sounded like he um he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was {vocalsound} interesting for the test situation but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it 's {vocalsound} what I 'd wanna use so I have to {disfmarker} I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet .\nProfessor A: OK . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again ,\nPhD D: It 's my\nPhD C: Oh yeah ?\nPhD D: I know this is mine here .\nProfessor A: so . OK . Um . {vocalsound} The um {disfmarker} so you , and then {vocalsound} you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the {disfmarker} the close mounted and the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts between the distant {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Uh I I 'm ho Right . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or I 'm hoping {disfmarker} I 'm hoping Espen will do it .\nProfessor A: Ah ! OK .\nGrad F: Um\nProfessor A: F um\nGrad F: u\nProfessor A: Delegate . That 's good . It 's good to delegate .\nGrad F: I {disfmarker} I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it .\nProfessor A: Great . Great . Yeah actually um he should uh I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . Um . {vocalsound} One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner {vocalsound} close - miked recordings . So uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close {disfmarker} close - miked uh cases um we 'd like to be able to have {vocalsound} um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from {disfmarker} So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be {disfmarker} So {vocalsound} what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but {vocalsound} uh just um uh taking the input from other mikes and using uh {vocalsound} uh a uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . So . Um what was it , there was {disfmarker} there was some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some point where {vocalsound} eh uh Eric or somebody was {disfmarker} was speaking and he had lots of {vocalsound} silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh {vocalsound} which was in the background and it was not {disfmarker} it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech {vocalsound} on the close {disfmarker} {vocalsound} close mike .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD B: Oh the {disfmarker} What we talked about yesterday ?\nProfessor A: Yes .\nPhD B: Yeah that was actually my {disfmarker} I was wearing the {disfmarker} I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,\nProfessor A: Oh you {disfmarker} it was you I was Yeah .\nPhD B: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that {disfmarker} mmm uh {disfmarker} that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out . So I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that . So . OK . Right ? Um . {vocalsound} And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the {disfmarker} the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but {vocalsound} maybe just a quick reprise of {disfmarker} of what we were saying this morning .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor A: Uh .\nGrad E: Um . {comment} So continuing to um extend\nPhD B: What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? And {disfmarker} and S Shawn , yeah . Oh . So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? I see .\nProfessor A: But that 's uh uh all {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} is a {disfmarker} a certainly relevant {comment} {vocalsound} uh study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . We have this problem with the overloading of the term \" feature \" so\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: uh {vocalsound} what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found {disfmarker} finding useful\nPhD C: Hmm .\nProfessor A: um for {disfmarker}\nPhD B: And their {disfmarker} their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features .\nProfessor A: Right . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nGrad E: Oh yeah .\nProfessor A: There 's those {vocalsound} {pause} that uh yeah , some of {disfmarker} some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on {disfmarker} on uh {vocalsound} what \" good features \" are and {disfmarker}\nPhD B: What does {disfmarker} what did um Larry Saul use for {disfmarker} it was the sonorant uh detector , right ? How did he {disfmarker} H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . So how did he combine all these features ? What {disfmarker} what r mmm classifier did he Hmm . Oh right . You were talking about that , yeah . I see .\nProfessor A: And the other thing you were talking about is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is where we get the targets from . So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the {disfmarker} what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels {vocalsound} from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this {disfmarker} this database ? This is the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Hmm !\nProfessor A: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah .\nPhD B: Pierced tongues and Yeah . You could just mount it to that and they wouldn't even notice . Weld it . Zzz .\nProfessor A: Maybe you could go to these parlors and {disfmarker} and you could , you know {disfmarker} you know have {disfmarker} have , you know , reduced rates if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you can do the measurements .\nPhD B: Yeah . I That 's right . You could {disfmarker} what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah , be cool and help science .\nPhD B: and Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD B: Hmm ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that {disfmarker} people have done studies like that w way way back right ? I mean {vocalsound} I can't remember where {disfmarker} uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of {disfmarker} Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ? Um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . I can't remember what his name was . Dang . Now I 'll think of it . That 's interesting .\nProfessor A: Do you mean eh {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} Mar\nPhD C: Well he was the guy {disfmarker} the guy that was using {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: you mean when was {disfmarker} was Mark Randolph there , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: Mark Randolph .\nProfessor A: Yeah he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's at Motorola now .\nPhD B: Oh is he ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know {disfmarker} I just remember it had to do with you know {vocalsound} uh positional parameters\nPhD C: What {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD B: and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So the only {disfmarker} the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {vocalsound} continuous variables and a bunch of them . And so\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there {disfmarker} What you really want are these binary {pause} labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas um {vocalsound} if you did something instead that {disfmarker} like um having some manual annotation by {vocalsound} uh you know , linguistics students , this would {disfmarker} there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with {disfmarker} with John before\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And then there would {disfmarker} it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable . Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables . So . I mean the other thing you could do is {vocalsound} boot trying to {disfmarker} to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from {vocalsound} uh the uh {vocalsound} uh the data itself there , but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Could you cluster the {disfmarker} just do some kind of clustering ?\nProfessor A: Guess you could , yeah .\nPhD B: Bin them up into different categories and {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Yeah . So anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} I mean in general it 's gonna be {disfmarker} for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to {vocalsound} wear the pellets and {disfmarker} Um . So .\nGrad E: Right . Right .\nPhD B: So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD B: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the true mappings are for each phone ?\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: I see .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in {disfmarker} in my mind , I guess , is that um {vocalsound} we 're looking at different ways that we can combine {vocalsound} uh different kinds of {disfmarker} of rep front - end representations {vocalsound} um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from {vocalsound} uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have {vocalsound} a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that {vocalsound} to change some of the other methods we have , since {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that {disfmarker} that it {disfmarker} it um {disfmarker} the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a {disfmarker} a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than {vocalsound} um just assuming {vocalsound} that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength {vocalsound} towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it {disfmarker} so um {vocalsound} he 's got these um uh uh\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: he \" AND 's \" between these different {vocalsound} features . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in {disfmarker} in principle {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different {disfmarker} soft \" OR 's \" across the different uh {vocalsound} multi - band channels . And um {vocalsound} the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" {disfmarker} \" AND ' ed \" things {vocalsound} is something that 's kept {vocalsound} uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is {disfmarker} is uh {vocalsound} taking {vocalsound} the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nPhD B: So he doesn't have {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: which means that it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's uh i It could be for instance {vocalsound} that for a particular point in the data {vocalsound} you don't want to um uh train a particular band {disfmarker} train the detectors for a particular band . You {disfmarker} you wanna ignore {vocalsound} that band , cuz that 's a {disfmarker} Ban - band is a noisy {disfmarker} noisy measure .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And we don't {disfmarker} We 're {disfmarker} we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well {disfmarker} well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .\nPhD B: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or {disfmarker} Ho\nGrad E: F right , and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels .\nProfessor A: Well at the {disfmarker} at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's {disfmarker} where it 's sonorant . But he 's {disfmarker} but what he 's - but what he 's not training up {disfmarker} uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\nGrad E: Right . For the full band .\nProfessor A: um I guess one way of describing would be if {disfmarker} if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ?\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor A: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . OK .\nProfessor A: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band {vocalsound} towards making your decision . And um {vocalsound} uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should {disfmarker} you should use everything {vocalsound} uh with {disfmarker} with uh equal strength .\nPhD B: I see .\nProfessor A: And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had {vocalsound} uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the {disfmarker} if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from {disfmarker} from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: So where did he get his {disfmarker} uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ?\nGrad E: From uh canonical mappings {comment} um at first\nPhD B: OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: and then it 's unclear um eh\nPhD B: Using TIMIT ? or using {disfmarker}\nGrad E: using TIMIT\nPhD B: Uh - huh .\nGrad E: right , right .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah . I mean we ha we have a kind of {vocalsound} iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this {disfmarker} cuz then whatever {vocalsound} that alignment is , it 's that for all {disfmarker} all bands .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate {disfmarker} tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . Um . But it 's still {vocalsound} not quite the same because then it 's {disfmarker} it 's um setting targets based on where you would say {vocalsound} the sound begins in a particular band . Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . Might be closer I guess if we did a {vocalsound} soft {disfmarker} soft target uh {vocalsound} uh embedded {vocalsound} neural net training like we 've done a few times uh {vocalsound} f the forward um {disfmarker} do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . Mmm . Uh what 's next ?\nPhD B: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with .\nProfessor A: Oh . You 're playing ?\nPhD B: I um Huh ?\nProfessor A: You 're playing ?\nPhD B: Yes , I 'm playing . Um {vocalsound} so I wanted to do this experiment to see um {vocalsound} uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um {disfmarker} I think I sent around last week a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where {vocalsound} I would take the um {disfmarker} the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for {vocalsound} the ICSI - OGI front - end .\nProfessor A: What {disfmarker} which test set was this ?\nPhD B: This is {disfmarker} that I looked at ?\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh {vocalsound} been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK {vocalsound} system for the Italian data and got the same results that um {disfmarker} that uh {vocalsound} Stephane had . So um I started looking {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} and now I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to {disfmarker} uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use {vocalsound} the same number of states for all of the models\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a {disfmarker} an HMM system is that you use {vocalsound} um three states per phone and um {vocalsound} so then the {disfmarker} the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . {vocalsound} Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use {vocalsound} uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five {vocalsound} which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} but for the {disfmarker} most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So {vocalsound} my guess {disfmarker} uh And then if you {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I printed out a confusion matrix um {vocalsound} uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that {vocalsound} you know , if you assume a fixed {disfmarker} the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh you 've got {disfmarker} you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So {vocalsound} it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's {disfmarker} because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific {vocalsound} um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the {disfmarker} for the longer word ,\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but .\nPhD B: Yeah so I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create {vocalsound} uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um {disfmarker} how these models were coming out , you know , what w {vocalsound} when we train up uh th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the {disfmarker} uh what do the transition probabilities look like {disfmarker} in the self - loops , {comment} look like in {disfmarker} in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can {vocalsound} calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did {disfmarker} quickly , I did the silence model and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the {vocalsound} string of digits .\nProfessor A: Wow . Lots of silence .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I {disfmarker} I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically {disfmarker} their {disfmarker} {vocalsound} their model for a whole digit string is silence {vocalsound} digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so .\nProfessor A: Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ?\nPhD B: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD B: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own {disfmarker} um It doesn't require its own training data ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: it just shares that state .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know {vocalsound} how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the {disfmarker} the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of {disfmarker} just from looking at the {vocalsound} durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .", "answers": ["The professor was not too excited about clustering.

What project ?\nProfessor B: Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .\nPhD A: Oh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . We were two {disfmarker} we were {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh , uh , we went through it {disfmarker} Jim and I went through old emails at one point and {disfmarker} and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're two months away from being done . It was very {disfmarker} very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and {disfmarker} with the schedules {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}\nPhD A: It was true for two years .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true .\nPhD A: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we {pause} go around and do , uh , status report {pause} kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So .\nProfessor B: Yeah . So we {pause} probably should wait for him to come before we do his .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: OK . That 's a good idea .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Any objection ? Do y OK , M\nProfessor B: All in favor\nPhD A: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B: Uh , I don't do anything . I {disfmarker} No , I mean , I {disfmarker} I 'm involved in discussions with {disfmarker} with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're {disfmarker} since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .\nGrad F: OK . So should I go so that , uh ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?\nGrad F: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad F: OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my {disfmarker} my proposal . So , um {disfmarker} Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh {disfmarker} on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a {disfmarker} as a middle step . And , um , I hope to {disfmarker} hope to get this , um {disfmarker} a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .\nPhD A: When is your , uh , meeting ?\nGrad F: Um , my meeting\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: with , uh {disfmarker} ? Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for that {disfmarker} for that part I would {disfmarker} I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for {disfmarker} for Switchboard . And I 'd run some {disfmarker} some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers .\nPhD A: Oh . So that 's why you were interested in getting your own features into the SRI files .\nGrad F: Yeah . That 's why I {disfmarker} I was asking about that .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah . Um , and I guess that 's {disfmarker} that 's it . Any {disfmarker} any questions ?\nPhD A: Sounds good . So you just have a few more weeks , huh ?\nGrad F: Um , yeah . A few more .\nPhD A: It 's about a month from now ?\nGrad F: It 's a {disfmarker} it 's a month and {disfmarker} and a week .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , uh , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we {disfmarker} we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , {vocalsound} six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um , {vocalsound} considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK {disfmarker} sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't . Um , so this , um {disfmarker} This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel {pause} normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the {disfmarker} Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts {pause} in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have {pause} different phones {pause} lined up with a different foreground phone , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} depending on {pause} the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um {disfmarker} Hmm .\nProfessor B: I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about {disfmarker} we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that {disfmarker} some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy {pause} sections ? Um , uh , if you {disfmarker} if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in {pause} late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a {disfmarker} an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what {disfmarker} what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero {disfmarker} set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a {disfmarker} a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in {disfmarker} So in this case you have some artificially imposed {pause} reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did {disfmarker} ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the {disfmarker} the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some {disfmarker} some , uh , very low or {disfmarker} or near zero {pause} value . I mean , uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that {disfmarker} that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: or pre - echoes , whichever they are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Be pretty simple . I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to {pause} keep in an echo than to throw out speech .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD G: Um , what is the reverberation time {pause} like {pause} there ?\nGrad E: In thi in this room ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD G: On , uh , the {disfmarker} the one what {disfmarker} the s in the speech that you are {disfmarker} you are using like ?\nGrad E: Y Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know .\nProfessor B: So , it 's this room .\nPhD G: It 's , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: It 's {disfmarker} it 's this room .\nPhD G: Oh , this room ?\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: so it 's {disfmarker} these are just microphone {disfmarker} this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on .\nGrad F: Oh .\nProfessor B: Uh , we should do a measurement in here . I g think we never have . I think it 's {disfmarker} I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T\nGrad F: Hmm !\nProfessor B: something like that ? But it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's this room .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD G: OK . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh . But the other thing is , he 's putting in {disfmarker} w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways . He 's also putting in , uh , a {disfmarker} he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has {pause} averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be {disfmarker} you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't . And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away . Uh , and if it 's a low {pause} energy compo portion , you might actually hear some {pause} funny things .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nGrad E: O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is {pause} just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I don't see why {disfmarker} why your signal is louder after processing , because yo\nGrad E: Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah . I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have {pause} better signal - to - noise ratio .\nPhD C: Well , well {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But just it being bigger if {disfmarker} with the same signal - to - noise ratio {disfmarker}\nGrad E: It w i i it wouldn't affect things .\nProfessor B: No .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: Well , the system is {disfmarker} use {pause} the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on {disfmarker} on the {pause} signal level . But , not so much , I guess .\nProfessor B: Well , yeah . But it 's trained and tested on the same thing .\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor B: So if the {disfmarker} if the {disfmarker} if you change {vocalsound} in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD A: Did you add {pause} this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ?\nGrad E: Uh {disfmarker} Um . Did I w what ?\nPhD A: Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect .\nGrad E: Sorry ? Yeah .\nPhD A: But I {disfmarker} I was {pause} sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I b\nPhD A: You didn't {pause} train it also .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} Right . I trained on clean TI - digits . I {disfmarker} I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits . But I didn't {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder .\nProfessor B: Oh , I see .\nGrad E: I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder .\nProfessor B: OK . Well , I don't understand then . Yeah .\nGrad E: Huh . I don't know . If it 's {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} like , if it 's trying to find a {disfmarker} a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter . And then if you take it out {disfmarker} that taking it out makes things louder . I mean .\nProfessor B: Uh , no . I mean , {vocalsound} uh , there 's {disfmarker} there 's nothing inherent about removing {disfmarker} if you 're really removing ,\nGrad E: Nuh - huh .\nProfessor B: uh , r uh , then I don't {pause} see how that would make it louder .\nGrad E: The mean . OK . Yeah , I see .\nProfessor B: So it might be just some {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . So I should maybe listen to that stuff again .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It might just be some artifact of the processing that {disfmarker} that , uh , if you 're {disfmarker} Uh , yeah . I don't know .\nGrad E: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: I wonder if there could be something like , uh {disfmarker} for s for the PZM data ,\nPhD C: Eh\nPhD A: uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . Uh . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um {disfmarker} you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it {disfmarker} it could cause {pause} you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , you know , there is this . Wait a minute . It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} i maybe {disfmarker} i If , um {disfmarker} Subtracting the {disfmarker} the mean log spectrum is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your {disfmarker} if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a {disfmarker} a question of {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . That 's something to think about .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: I had a question about the system {disfmarker} the SRI system . So , {vocalsound} you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on {pause} Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . Uh , but is it {pause} exactly the same system ?\nGrad E: Uh . I think so .\nPhD C: Hmm .\nGrad E: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , um , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um , like MLLR transformations also ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a {disfmarker} a result on testing on Macrophone or {disfmarker} or training ?\nPhD C: all that stuff .\nGrad E: That 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: It was {pause} training on Macrophone and testing {disfmarker} yeah , on {disfmarker} on meeting digits .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that was done already . So we were {disfmarker} Uh , and it 's point eight ? OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I 've just been text {comment} testing the new {pause} Aurora front - end with {disfmarker} well , Aurora system actually {disfmarker} so front - end and HTK , um , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . We have {disfmarker} I have two point seven percent error rate . And before with the system that was proposed , it 's what ? It was three point nine . So .\nProfessor B: Oh , that 's a lot better .\nPhD C: We are getting better .\nProfessor B: So , what {disfmarker} w ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: With the {disfmarker} with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ?\nPhD C: Yeah . Two point seven .\nPhD G: I know in the meeting , like {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the meeting we have two point seven .\nPhD G: Right . Oh .\nGrad F: That 's with the new IIR filters ?\nPhD C: Uh . Yeah , yeah . So , yeah ,\nGrad F: OK .\nPhD C: we have {pause} the new LDA filters , and {disfmarker} I think , maybe {disfmarker} I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation . Uh , eh {disfmarker} Do y did you have a look at {disfmarker} at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I didn't . No .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD G: No . The DC component could be negligible . I mean , if you are {pause} recording it through a mike . I mean , any {disfmarker} all of the mikes have the DC removal {disfmarker} some capacitor sitting right in {pause} that bias it .\nProfessor B: Yeah . But this {disfmarker} uh , uh , uh , no . Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold in the A - toD. And these period these typically do have a DC offset .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: And {disfmarker} and they can be surprisingly large . It depends on the electronics .\nPhD G: Oh , so it is the digital {disfmarker} OK . It 's the A - toD that introduces the DC in .\nProfessor B: Yeah . The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC .\nPhD G: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: typi you know , unless {disfmarker} Actually , there are {pause} instrumentation mikes that {disfmarker} that do pass {disfmarker} go down to DC . But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: uh , no , it 's the electronics . And they {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: then there 's amplification afterwards . And you can get , I think it was {disfmarker} I think it was in the {pause} Wall Street Journal data that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I can't remember , one of the DARPA things . There was this big DC - DC offset\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: we didn't {disfmarker} we didn't know about for a while , while we were {pause} messing with it . And we were getting these terrible results . And then we were talking to somebody and they said , \" Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ? Everybody knows that . There 's all this DC offset in th \" So , yes . You can have DC offset in the data .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD G: OK .\nPhD A: So was that {disfmarker} was that everything , Dave ?\nGrad E: Oh . And I also , um , did some experiments {pause} about normalizing the phase . Um . So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at . And , um , the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea , um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases . They {disfmarker} they add in this modulo two pi way and , um , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really {pause} mathematically correct . So , {vocalsound} what I did instead is I {vocalsound} took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase {pause} off to normalize . But that , um , didn't work either .\nProfessor B: See , we have a different interpretation of this . He says it doesn't work . I said , I think it works magnificently , but just not for the task we intended . Uh , it gets rid of the speech .\nPhD A: What does it leave ?\nGrad F: Uh , gets rid of the speech .\nProfessor B: Uh , it leaves {disfmarker} you know , it leaves the junk . I mean , I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's tremendous .\nGrad F: Oh , wow .\nProfessor B: You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something .\nPhD A: Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ?\nProfessor B: Ex - exactly . Yeah , you got it .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a general rule .\nPhD G: Oh , it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . Including what I just said .\nGrad E: And , yeah , that 's everything .\nPhD A: All set ? Do you want to go , Stephane ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . Maybe , concerning these d still , these meeting digits . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because {pause} this is also one big difference between {pause} the two systems . Um , the other differences were {pause} the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more {disfmarker} SRI system are more complex . But , uh , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and\nPhD A: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system .\nPhD C: it was hard t to {disfmarker} to have some exper some improvement with this . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , it sounds like they also have {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he 's saying they have all these , uh , uh , different kinds of adaptation .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: You know , they have channel adaptation . They have speaker adaptation .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right .\nPhD A: Well , there 's also the normalization .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Like they do , um {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits ,\nPhD C: The vocal tr\nPhD A: but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's , um {disfmarker} conversation - side normalization for the {pause} non - C - zero components ,\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . This is another difference . Their normalization works like on {disfmarker} on the utterance levels .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But we have to do it {disfmarker} We have a system that does it on - line .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: So , it might be {disfmarker} it might be better with {disfmarker} it might be worse if the {pause} channel is constant ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: or {disfmarker} Nnn .\nPhD G: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or {disfmarker} or is it the whole word ?\nPhD C: SRI {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's tr\nGrad F: SRI .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . I guess it 's triphones .\nPhD G: It 's triphone .\nProfessor B: I think it 's probably more than that .\nPhD C: Huh .\nProfessor B: I mean , so they {disfmarker} they have {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thin think they use these , uh , uh , genone things . So there 's {disfmarker} there 's these kind of , uh , uh , pooled models and {disfmarker} and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies .\nPhD G: Oh . It 's like the tied state .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: They have tied states and I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . But I think {disfmarker} I think they {disfmarker} they don't just have triphones .\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: I think they have a range of {disfmarker} of , uh , dependencies .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Yeah . Well . Um . Well , the first thing I {disfmarker} that I want to do is just maybe these gender things . Uh . And maybe see with {pause} Andreas if {disfmarker} Well , I {disfmarker} I don't know {pause} how much it helps , what 's the model .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ?\nPhD C: That 's right . So it 's the clean {pause} TI - digits training set .\nPhD A: So exact same training data ?\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I guess you used the clean training set .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: For {disfmarker} with the SRI system {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Well .\nGrad E: You know , the {disfmarker} the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , um , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , um , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . But I don't think there 's any other difference .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B: So is that {disfmarker} ? Uh , are {disfmarker} are these results comparable ? So you {disfmarker} you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent {pause} on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits {disfmarker} {comment} TI - digits . Right ? And {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ?\nPhD C: Yeah . I think so .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So it 's {pause} about the same ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: maybe a little worse .\nGrad E: W w it was one {disfmarker} one point two\nPhD C: Ye\nGrad E: with the SRI system ,\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The complete SRI system is one point two .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you were HTK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right ? OK . That 's right . So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK , so {pause} the comparable number then , uh {pause} for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the {pause} um , two point f\nPhD C: It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , uh , b\nGrad E: D d\nProfessor B: Oh , right , right , right , right .\nPhD C: MFCC features {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent .\nProfessor B: Right . Right , right , right .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: OK . Alright . So {disfmarker} He 's doing some {pause} different things .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker} Yeah . The only difference is the features , right now , between this and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yes . OK , good . So they are helping .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: That 's good to hear . Yeah .\nPhD C: They are helping . Yeah . Um . Yeah . And another thing I {disfmarker} I maybe would like to do is to {pause} just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone {disfmarker} test it on , uh , the noisy TI - digits ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: cuz I 'm still wondering {pause} where this {pause} improvement comes from . When you train on Macrophone , it seems better on meeting digits . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe {pause} Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than {disfmarker} than TI - digit is , which is {disfmarker} TI - digits are very {pause} clean recorded digits\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know , it would also be interesting to see , uh {disfmarker} to do the regular Aurora test ,\nPhD C: Uh , f s\nPhD A: um , but use the SRI system instead of HTK .\nPhD C: That 's {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's what {pause} I wanted , just , uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So , just using the SRI system , test it on {disfmarker} and test it on {pause} Aurora TI - digits . Right .\nPhD A: Why not the full Aurora , uh , test ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . There is this problem of multilinguality yet .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: So we don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: You 'd have to train the SRI system with {disfmarker} with all the different languages .\nPhD C: i i\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: We would have to train on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . That 's what I mean .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , like , comple\nProfessor B: It 'd be a {pause} lot of work . That 's the only thing .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well , I mean ,\nPhD C: Mmm .\nPhD A: uh , uh , I guess the work would be into getting the {disfmarker} the files in the right formats , or something . Right ? I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're , uh {disfmarker} you 're also training on all the data .\nPhD C: That 's right .\nPhD A: I mean , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . I see . Oh , so , OK . Right . I see what you mean .\nProfessor B: That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: because {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a good idea , but it seems like {pause} it makes sense to do some pruning\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: first with a {disfmarker} a test or two that makes sense for you ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then {pause} take the likely candidates and go further .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information {pause} about what 's going on . And {disfmarker} mm - hmm . Uh , yeah . OK . Uh , the next thing is this {disfmarker} this VAD problem that , um , um {disfmarker} So , I 'm just talking about the {disfmarker} the curves that I {disfmarker} I sent {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I sent you {disfmarker} so , whi that shows that {vocalsound} when the SNR decrease , {vocalsound} uh , the current {pause} VAD approach doesn't drop much frames {pause} for some particular noises , uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically .\nProfessor B: I i Just to clarify something for me . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So does any of this matter ? I mean , other than our interest in it . Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Uh {disfmarker} Well . First of all , the boundaries might be , uh {disfmarker} like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or {disfmarker} before and after speech . Uh . So removing more than that might still make {pause} a difference {pause} in the results .\nProfessor B: Do we {disfmarker} ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} No . Because we don't {disfmarker} didn't looked {pause} that much at that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: But , {vocalsound} still , I think it 's an interesting problem .\nProfessor B: Oh , yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when {disfmarker} when , uh , the gang gets back from Crete . Because {pause} there 's lots of interesting problems , of course .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: And then the thing is if {disfmarker} if they really are going to have some means of giving us {pause} fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue .\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Um But {vocalsound} I don't know .\nPhD G: Because w we were wondering whether that {pause} VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if {disfmarker} if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: to find a {disfmarker} I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more {pause} suitable for us .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't {pause} use that information anymore ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: So . We don't know what is the type of {pause} {vocalsound} {pause} VAD which they 're going to provide .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . And actually there 's {disfmarker} Yeah . There 's an {disfmarker} uh , I think it 's still for {disfmarker} even for the evaluation , uh , it might still be interesting to {vocalsound} work on this because {pause} the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , {vocalsound} um , starting of speech and end of speech {pause} uh , at the utterance level . And {disfmarker} Um .\nPhD G: With some {disfmarker} some gap .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that {disfmarker} whatever the hang - over time which they are talking .\nPhD C: Yeah . But when you have like , uh , five or six frames , both {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Yeah . Then the they will just fill {disfmarker} fill it up .\nPhD C: it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , th {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So if you could get at some of that , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: although that 'd be hard .\nPhD C: Yeah . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other {pause} things that we want to work on .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right . OK .\nPhD C: But {disfmarker} Mmm . Yeah . So I did {disfmarker} I just {pause} started to test {pause} putting together two VAD which was {disfmarker} was not much work actually . Um , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , {vocalsound} um , energy - based VAD {vocalsound} that , uh , the other Aurora guys use . Um . So , which is just putting a threshold on {pause} the noise energy ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and , detect detecting the first {pause} group of four frames {pause} that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , uh , from this point , uh , tagging the frames there as speech . So it removes {vocalsound} the first silent portion {disfmarker} portion of each utterance . And it really removes it , um , still o on the noises where {pause} our MLP VAD doesn't {pause} work a lot .\nProfessor B: Mmm .\nPhD C: Uh ,\nProfessor B: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral {pause} information ,\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: uh {disfmarker} uh , you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance {disfmarker} uh , would give you some {pause} better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or {disfmarker} or , uh {pause} stop consonants , or something like that .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nPhD C: Yeah . So , your point is {disfmarker} will be to u use whatever {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and {pause} nonspeech . And , um ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And {disfmarker} and most , um , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a {disfmarker} a high - pass kind of characteristic {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: an upward slope . So having some kind of a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: uh , you know , at the beginning of a {disfmarker} of a {disfmarker} of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it will tend to have this high - frequency component . Whereas , {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency . Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: it plus energy plus timing information is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of {pause} what they were using then .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: So , yeah . It {disfmarker} it might be that what I did is {disfmarker} so , removes like {vocalsound} low , um , {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} low - energy , uh , speech frames . Because {pause} the way I do it is I just {disfmarker} I just combine the two decisions {disfmarker} so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} with the and {pause} operator . So , I only {pause} keep the frames where the two agree {pause} that it 's speech . So if the energy - based dropped {disfmarker} dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are lost . Mmm .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But s still , the way it 's done right now it {disfmarker} it helps on {disfmarker} on the noises where {disfmarker} it seems to help on the noises where {vocalsound} our VAD was not very {pause} good .\nProfessor B: Well , I guess {disfmarker} I mean , one could imagine combining them in different ways . But {disfmarker} but , I guess what you 're saying is that the {disfmarker} the MLP - based one has the spectral information . So .\nPhD C: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done {disfmarker} Well , yeah .\nProfessor B: Well , you can imagine {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is {disfmarker} So , it {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Is {disfmarker} ?\nPhD C: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are {disfmarker} are , uh , dropped , even if the , um , MLP decides to keep them .\nProfessor B: Right . Right . And that might not be optimal ,\nPhD C: But , yeah .\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: No\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker} I mean , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , a probability estimated by each one and {disfmarker} and put them together .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mmm . M Yeah .\nPhD A: Something that {disfmarker} that I 've used in the past is , um {disfmarker} when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . And you {pause} make your decision when the derivative is increasing for {pause} so many frames . Then you say that 's beginning of speech .\nPhD C: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: But , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . I guess it depends on how you do it . But {pause} I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's been a useful thing .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it . I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: then only make a decision because {pause} you still need to smooth the {pause} decision further .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD G: So that 's always there .\nPhD A: Yeah . OK .\nPhD C: Well , actually if I don't {disfmarker} maybe don't want to work too much of {disfmarker} on it right now . I just wanted to {disfmarker} to see if it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what I observed was the re was caused by this {disfmarker} this VAD problem .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And it seems to be the case . Um . Uh , the second thing is the {disfmarker} this spectral subtraction . Um . Um , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , uh , {nonvocalsound} twenty - five experiments , uh , with different , uh , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use {pause} an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} noise than the noise spectra that {pause} is estimated {pause} on the noise portion of the s uh , the utterances . So I tried several , uh , over - estimation factors . And after subtraction , I also add {pause} a constant noise , and I also try different , uh , {vocalsound} noise , uh , values and we 'll see what happen .\nProfessor B: Hmm . OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . But st still when we look at the , um {disfmarker} Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . Um . On the other hand , when you {pause} subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but {pause} maybe you distort a lot of speech . So . Well . Mmm . Well , it {disfmarker} until now , it doesn't seem to help . But We 'll see . So the next thing , maybe I {disfmarker} what I will {pause} try to {disfmarker} to do is just {pause} to try to smooth mmm , {vocalsound} the , um {disfmarker} to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right . Mmm .\nPhD G: Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ?\nPhD C: Yeah . So , to get something that 's {disfmarker} would be closer to {pause} what you tried to do with Wiener filtering .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD G: Actually , it 's , uh {disfmarker} Uh . I don't know , it 's {disfmarker} go ahead .\nPhD C: It {disfmarker}\nPhD G: And it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Maybe you can {disfmarker}\nPhD G: go ahead .\nPhD C: I think it 's {disfmarker} That 's it for me .\nPhD G: OK . So , uh {disfmarker} u th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . And there are {disfmarker} there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was {disfmarker} I was assuming that always the VAD {disfmarker} uh , the initial frames were silence . It always started in the silence state , but it wasn't for some utterances . So the {disfmarker} it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So this is on SpeechDat - Car Italian ?\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: So , in some cases s there are also {disfmarker}\nPhD G: SpeechDat - Car Italian . Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are .\nPhD C: o Uh - huh .\nPhD G: So that was one of the {pause} bugs that was there in estimating the noise . And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with {pause} different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the {disfmarker} the trend seems to be like , {vocalsound} uh , smoothing the {pause} current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like {pause} deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the {disfmarker} estimating the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like {disfmarker} it 's still comparable to the baseline . I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . And , uh , so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So there are three time constants that I have . So , I 'm just playing around . So , one is fixed in the line , like {pause} Smoothing the clean speech is {disfmarker} is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying {disfmarker} trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that {disfmarker} if some {disfmarker} In some cases the clean speech is , like {disfmarker} when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't {pause} vary a lot in the low - energy regions . And , uh . So . The results are , like {disfmarker} So far I 've been testing only with the {pause} baseline , which is {disfmarker} which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . I just want to separate the {disfmarker} the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , uh , just the spectral {disfmarker} I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . Um . And the other thing that I tried was {disfmarker} but I just {vocalsound} took of those , uh , {pause} {vocalsound} Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a {disfmarker} a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And it 's {disfmarker} it seems to be like it 's not {vocalsound} hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a {pause} four hertz {disfmarker} a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had . And so {disfmarker} Yeah . Just {disfmarker} just to see whether it really {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} is it worth trying or not . So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that . So there must be something that I can {disfmarker} that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess I would ask Carlos about that . I mean , how {disfmarker} how he derived those filters and {disfmarker} and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which {disfmarker} what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: This is cubic root of power spectra ?\nPhD G: Yeah . Cubic root of power spectrum .\nProfessor B: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . Right ?\nPhD G: Yeah . And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: So it has , like {disfmarker} the spectrogram has , like {disfmarker} Uh , it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's {disfmarker} there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So , those are the regions where there are , like {disfmarker} when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So . That 's {pause} something I observe using that filter . And {disfmarker} Yeah . There are a few {disfmarker} very {disfmarker} not a lot of {disfmarker} because the filter doesn't have a {disfmarker} really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ? OK ?\nProfessor B: OK . Why don't we read some digits ?\nPhD A: Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ?\nProfessor B: Sure .\nPhD A: Transcript L dash two one five .\nProfessor B: O K .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Grad F say about his proposal?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did Grad F say about his proposal?", "context": "Professor B: I think for two years we were two months , uh , away from being done .\nPhD A: And what was that , Morgan ? What project ?\nProfessor B: Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .\nPhD A: Oh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . We were two {disfmarker} we were {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh , uh , we went through it {disfmarker} Jim and I went through old emails at one point and {disfmarker} and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're two months away from being done . It was very {disfmarker} very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and {disfmarker} with the schedules {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}\nPhD A: It was true for two years .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true .\nPhD A: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we {pause} go around and do , uh , status report {pause} kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So .\nProfessor B: Yeah . So we {pause} probably should wait for him to come before we do his .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: OK . That 's a good idea .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Any objection ? Do y OK , M\nProfessor B: All in favor\nPhD A: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B: Uh , I don't do anything . I {disfmarker} No , I mean , I {disfmarker} I 'm involved in discussions with {disfmarker} with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're {disfmarker} since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .\nGrad F: OK . So should I go so that , uh ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?\nGrad F: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad F: OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my {disfmarker} my proposal . So , um {disfmarker} Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh {disfmarker} on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a {disfmarker} as a middle step . And , um , I hope to {disfmarker} hope to get this , um {disfmarker} a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .\nPhD A: When is your , uh , meeting ?\nGrad F: Um , my meeting\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: with , uh {disfmarker} ? Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for that {disfmarker} for that part I would {disfmarker} I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for {disfmarker} for Switchboard . And I 'd run some {disfmarker} some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers .\nPhD A: Oh . So that 's why you were interested in getting your own features into the SRI files .\nGrad F: Yeah . That 's why I {disfmarker} I was asking about that .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah . Um , and I guess that 's {disfmarker} that 's it . Any {disfmarker} any questions ?\nPhD A: Sounds good . So you just have a few more weeks , huh ?\nGrad F: Um , yeah . A few more .\nPhD A: It 's about a month from now ?\nGrad F: It 's a {disfmarker} it 's a month and {disfmarker} and a week .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , uh , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we {disfmarker} we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , {vocalsound} six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um , {vocalsound} considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK {disfmarker} sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't . Um , so this , um {disfmarker} This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel {pause} normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the {disfmarker} Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts {pause} in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have {pause} different phones {pause} lined up with a different foreground phone , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} depending on {pause} the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um {disfmarker} Hmm .\nProfessor B: I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about {disfmarker} we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that {disfmarker} some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy {pause} sections ? Um , uh , if you {disfmarker} if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in {pause} late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a {disfmarker} an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what {disfmarker} what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero {disfmarker} set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a {disfmarker} a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in {disfmarker} So in this case you have some artificially imposed {pause} reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did {disfmarker} ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the {disfmarker} the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some {disfmarker} some , uh , very low or {disfmarker} or near zero {pause} value . I mean , uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that {disfmarker} that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: or pre - echoes , whichever they are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Be pretty simple . I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to {pause} keep in an echo than to throw out speech .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD G: Um , what is the reverberation time {pause} like {pause} there ?\nGrad E: In thi in this room ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD G: On , uh , the {disfmarker} the one what {disfmarker} the s in the speech that you are {disfmarker} you are using like ?\nGrad E: Y Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know .\nProfessor B: So , it 's this room .\nPhD G: It 's , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: It 's {disfmarker} it 's this room .\nPhD G: Oh , this room ?\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: so it 's {disfmarker} these are just microphone {disfmarker} this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on .\nGrad F: Oh .\nProfessor B: Uh , we should do a measurement in here . I g think we never have . I think it 's {disfmarker} I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T\nGrad F: Hmm !\nProfessor B: something like that ? But it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's this room .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD G: OK . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh . But the other thing is , he 's putting in {disfmarker} w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways . He 's also putting in , uh , a {disfmarker} he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has {pause} averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be {disfmarker} you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't . And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away . Uh , and if it 's a low {pause} energy compo portion , you might actually hear some {pause} funny things .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nGrad E: O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is {pause} just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I don't see why {disfmarker} why your signal is louder after processing , because yo\nGrad E: Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah . I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have {pause} better signal - to - noise ratio .\nPhD C: Well , well {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But just it being bigger if {disfmarker} with the same signal - to - noise ratio {disfmarker}\nGrad E: It w i i it wouldn't affect things .\nProfessor B: No .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: Well , the system is {disfmarker} use {pause} the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on {disfmarker} on the {pause} signal level . But , not so much , I guess .\nProfessor B: Well , yeah . But it 's trained and tested on the same thing .\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor B: So if the {disfmarker} if the {disfmarker} if you change {vocalsound} in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD A: Did you add {pause} this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ?\nGrad E: Uh {disfmarker} Um . Did I w what ?\nPhD A: Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect .\nGrad E: Sorry ? Yeah .\nPhD A: But I {disfmarker} I was {pause} sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I b\nPhD A: You didn't {pause} train it also .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} Right . I trained on clean TI - digits . I {disfmarker} I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits . But I didn't {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder .\nProfessor B: Oh , I see .\nGrad E: I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder .\nProfessor B: OK . Well , I don't understand then . Yeah .\nGrad E: Huh . I don't know . If it 's {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} like , if it 's trying to find a {disfmarker} a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter . And then if you take it out {disfmarker} that taking it out makes things louder . I mean .\nProfessor B: Uh , no . I mean , {vocalsound} uh , there 's {disfmarker} there 's nothing inherent about removing {disfmarker} if you 're really removing ,\nGrad E: Nuh - huh .\nProfessor B: uh , r uh , then I don't {pause} see how that would make it louder .\nGrad E: The mean . OK . Yeah , I see .\nProfessor B: So it might be just some {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . So I should maybe listen to that stuff again .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It might just be some artifact of the processing that {disfmarker} that , uh , if you 're {disfmarker} Uh , yeah . I don't know .\nGrad E: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: I wonder if there could be something like , uh {disfmarker} for s for the PZM data ,\nPhD C: Eh\nPhD A: uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . Uh . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um {disfmarker} you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it {disfmarker} it could cause {pause} you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , you know , there is this . Wait a minute . It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} i maybe {disfmarker} i If , um {disfmarker} Subtracting the {disfmarker} the mean log spectrum is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your {disfmarker} if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a {disfmarker} a question of {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . That 's something to think about .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: I had a question about the system {disfmarker} the SRI system . So , {vocalsound} you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on {pause} Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . Uh , but is it {pause} exactly the same system ?\nGrad E: Uh . I think so .\nPhD C: Hmm .\nGrad E: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , um , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um , like MLLR transformations also ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a {disfmarker} a result on testing on Macrophone or {disfmarker} or training ?\nPhD C: all that stuff .\nGrad E: That 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: It was {pause} training on Macrophone and testing {disfmarker} yeah , on {disfmarker} on meeting digits .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that was done already . So we were {disfmarker} Uh , and it 's point eight ? OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I 've just been text {comment} testing the new {pause} Aurora front - end with {disfmarker} well , Aurora system actually {disfmarker} so front - end and HTK , um , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . We have {disfmarker} I have two point seven percent error rate . And before with the system that was proposed , it 's what ? It was three point nine . So .\nProfessor B: Oh , that 's a lot better .\nPhD C: We are getting better .\nProfessor B: So , what {disfmarker} w ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: With the {disfmarker} with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ?\nPhD C: Yeah . Two point seven .\nPhD G: I know in the meeting , like {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the meeting we have two point seven .\nPhD G: Right . Oh .\nGrad F: That 's with the new IIR filters ?\nPhD C: Uh . Yeah , yeah . So , yeah ,\nGrad F: OK .\nPhD C: we have {pause} the new LDA filters , and {disfmarker} I think , maybe {disfmarker} I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation . Uh , eh {disfmarker} Do y did you have a look at {disfmarker} at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I didn't . No .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD G: No . The DC component could be negligible . I mean , if you are {pause} recording it through a mike . I mean , any {disfmarker} all of the mikes have the DC removal {disfmarker} some capacitor sitting right in {pause} that bias it .\nProfessor B: Yeah . But this {disfmarker} uh , uh , uh , no . Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold in the A - toD. And these period these typically do have a DC offset .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: And {disfmarker} and they can be surprisingly large . It depends on the electronics .\nPhD G: Oh , so it is the digital {disfmarker} OK . It 's the A - toD that introduces the DC in .\nProfessor B: Yeah . The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC .\nPhD G: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: typi you know , unless {disfmarker} Actually , there are {pause} instrumentation mikes that {disfmarker} that do pass {disfmarker} go down to DC . But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: uh , no , it 's the electronics . And they {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: then there 's amplification afterwards . And you can get , I think it was {disfmarker} I think it was in the {pause} Wall Street Journal data that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I can't remember , one of the DARPA things . There was this big DC - DC offset\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: we didn't {disfmarker} we didn't know about for a while , while we were {pause} messing with it . And we were getting these terrible results . And then we were talking to somebody and they said , \" Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ? Everybody knows that . There 's all this DC offset in th \" So , yes . You can have DC offset in the data .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD G: OK .\nPhD A: So was that {disfmarker} was that everything , Dave ?\nGrad E: Oh . And I also , um , did some experiments {pause} about normalizing the phase . Um . So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at . And , um , the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea , um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases . They {disfmarker} they add in this modulo two pi way and , um , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really {pause} mathematically correct . So , {vocalsound} what I did instead is I {vocalsound} took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase {pause} off to normalize . But that , um , didn't work either .\nProfessor B: See , we have a different interpretation of this . He says it doesn't work . I said , I think it works magnificently , but just not for the task we intended . Uh , it gets rid of the speech .\nPhD A: What does it leave ?\nGrad F: Uh , gets rid of the speech .\nProfessor B: Uh , it leaves {disfmarker} you know , it leaves the junk . I mean , I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's tremendous .\nGrad F: Oh , wow .\nProfessor B: You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something .\nPhD A: Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ?\nProfessor B: Ex - exactly . Yeah , you got it .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a general rule .\nPhD G: Oh , it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . Including what I just said .\nGrad E: And , yeah , that 's everything .\nPhD A: All set ? Do you want to go , Stephane ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . Maybe , concerning these d still , these meeting digits . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because {pause} this is also one big difference between {pause} the two systems . Um , the other differences were {pause} the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more {disfmarker} SRI system are more complex . But , uh , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and\nPhD A: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system .\nPhD C: it was hard t to {disfmarker} to have some exper some improvement with this . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , it sounds like they also have {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he 's saying they have all these , uh , uh , different kinds of adaptation .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: You know , they have channel adaptation . They have speaker adaptation .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right .\nPhD A: Well , there 's also the normalization .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Like they do , um {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits ,\nPhD C: The vocal tr\nPhD A: but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's , um {disfmarker} conversation - side normalization for the {pause} non - C - zero components ,\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . This is another difference . Their normalization works like on {disfmarker} on the utterance levels .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But we have to do it {disfmarker} We have a system that does it on - line .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: So , it might be {disfmarker} it might be better with {disfmarker} it might be worse if the {pause} channel is constant ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: or {disfmarker} Nnn .\nPhD G: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or {disfmarker} or is it the whole word ?\nPhD C: SRI {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's tr\nGrad F: SRI .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . I guess it 's triphones .\nPhD G: It 's triphone .\nProfessor B: I think it 's probably more than that .\nPhD C: Huh .\nProfessor B: I mean , so they {disfmarker} they have {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thin think they use these , uh , uh , genone things . So there 's {disfmarker} there 's these kind of , uh , uh , pooled models and {disfmarker} and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies .\nPhD G: Oh . It 's like the tied state .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: They have tied states and I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . But I think {disfmarker} I think they {disfmarker} they don't just have triphones .\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: I think they have a range of {disfmarker} of , uh , dependencies .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Yeah . Well . Um . Well , the first thing I {disfmarker} that I want to do is just maybe these gender things . Uh . And maybe see with {pause} Andreas if {disfmarker} Well , I {disfmarker} I don't know {pause} how much it helps , what 's the model .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ?\nPhD C: That 's right . So it 's the clean {pause} TI - digits training set .\nPhD A: So exact same training data ?\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I guess you used the clean training set .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: For {disfmarker} with the SRI system {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Well .\nGrad E: You know , the {disfmarker} the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , um , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , um , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . But I don't think there 's any other difference .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B: So is that {disfmarker} ? Uh , are {disfmarker} are these results comparable ? So you {disfmarker} you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent {pause} on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits {disfmarker} {comment} TI - digits . Right ? And {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ?\nPhD C: Yeah . I think so .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So it 's {pause} about the same ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: maybe a little worse .\nGrad E: W w it was one {disfmarker} one point two\nPhD C: Ye\nGrad E: with the SRI system ,\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The complete SRI system is one point two .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you were HTK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right ? OK . That 's right . So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK , so {pause} the comparable number then , uh {pause} for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the {pause} um , two point f\nPhD C: It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , uh , b\nGrad E: D d\nProfessor B: Oh , right , right , right , right .\nPhD C: MFCC features {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent .\nProfessor B: Right . Right , right , right .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: OK . Alright . So {disfmarker} He 's doing some {pause} different things .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker} Yeah . The only difference is the features , right now , between this and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yes . OK , good . So they are helping .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: That 's good to hear . Yeah .\nPhD C: They are helping . Yeah . Um . Yeah . And another thing I {disfmarker} I maybe would like to do is to {pause} just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone {disfmarker} test it on , uh , the noisy TI - digits ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: cuz I 'm still wondering {pause} where this {pause} improvement comes from . When you train on Macrophone , it seems better on meeting digits . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe {pause} Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than {disfmarker} than TI - digit is , which is {disfmarker} TI - digits are very {pause} clean recorded digits\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know , it would also be interesting to see , uh {disfmarker} to do the regular Aurora test ,\nPhD C: Uh , f s\nPhD A: um , but use the SRI system instead of HTK .\nPhD C: That 's {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's what {pause} I wanted , just , uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So , just using the SRI system , test it on {disfmarker} and test it on {pause} Aurora TI - digits . Right .\nPhD A: Why not the full Aurora , uh , test ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . There is this problem of multilinguality yet .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: So we don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: You 'd have to train the SRI system with {disfmarker} with all the different languages .\nPhD C: i i\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: We would have to train on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . That 's what I mean .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , like , comple\nProfessor B: It 'd be a {pause} lot of work . That 's the only thing .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well , I mean ,\nPhD C: Mmm .\nPhD A: uh , uh , I guess the work would be into getting the {disfmarker} the files in the right formats , or something . Right ? I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're , uh {disfmarker} you 're also training on all the data .\nPhD C: That 's right .\nPhD A: I mean , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . I see . Oh , so , OK . Right . I see what you mean .\nProfessor B: That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: because {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a good idea , but it seems like {pause} it makes sense to do some pruning\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: first with a {disfmarker} a test or two that makes sense for you ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then {pause} take the likely candidates and go further .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information {pause} about what 's going on . And {disfmarker} mm - hmm . Uh , yeah . OK . Uh , the next thing is this {disfmarker} this VAD problem that , um , um {disfmarker} So , I 'm just talking about the {disfmarker} the curves that I {disfmarker} I sent {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I sent you {disfmarker} so , whi that shows that {vocalsound} when the SNR decrease , {vocalsound} uh , the current {pause} VAD approach doesn't drop much frames {pause} for some particular noises , uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically .\nProfessor B: I i Just to clarify something for me . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So does any of this matter ? I mean , other than our interest in it . Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Uh {disfmarker} Well . First of all , the boundaries might be , uh {disfmarker} like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or {disfmarker} before and after speech . Uh . So removing more than that might still make {pause} a difference {pause} in the results .\nProfessor B: Do we {disfmarker} ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} No . Because we don't {disfmarker} didn't looked {pause} that much at that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: But , {vocalsound} still , I think it 's an interesting problem .\nProfessor B: Oh , yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when {disfmarker} when , uh , the gang gets back from Crete . Because {pause} there 's lots of interesting problems , of course .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: And then the thing is if {disfmarker} if they really are going to have some means of giving us {pause} fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue .\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Um But {vocalsound} I don't know .\nPhD G: Because w we were wondering whether that {pause} VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if {disfmarker} if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: to find a {disfmarker} I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more {pause} suitable for us .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't {pause} use that information anymore ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: So . We don't know what is the type of {pause} {vocalsound} {pause} VAD which they 're going to provide .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . And actually there 's {disfmarker} Yeah . There 's an {disfmarker} uh , I think it 's still for {disfmarker} even for the evaluation , uh , it might still be interesting to {vocalsound} work on this because {pause} the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , {vocalsound} um , starting of speech and end of speech {pause} uh , at the utterance level . And {disfmarker} Um .\nPhD G: With some {disfmarker} some gap .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that {disfmarker} whatever the hang - over time which they are talking .\nPhD C: Yeah . But when you have like , uh , five or six frames , both {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Yeah . Then the they will just fill {disfmarker} fill it up .\nPhD C: it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , th {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So if you could get at some of that , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: although that 'd be hard .\nPhD C: Yeah . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other {pause} things that we want to work on .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right . OK .\nPhD C: But {disfmarker} Mmm . Yeah . So I did {disfmarker} I just {pause} started to test {pause} putting together two VAD which was {disfmarker} was not much work actually . Um , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , {vocalsound} um , energy - based VAD {vocalsound} that , uh , the other Aurora guys use . Um . So , which is just putting a threshold on {pause} the noise energy ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and , detect detecting the first {pause} group of four frames {pause} that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , uh , from this point , uh , tagging the frames there as speech . So it removes {vocalsound} the first silent portion {disfmarker} portion of each utterance . And it really removes it , um , still o on the noises where {pause} our MLP VAD doesn't {pause} work a lot .\nProfessor B: Mmm .\nPhD C: Uh ,\nProfessor B: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral {pause} information ,\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: uh {disfmarker} uh , you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance {disfmarker} uh , would give you some {pause} better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or {disfmarker} or , uh {pause} stop consonants , or something like that .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nPhD C: Yeah . So , your point is {disfmarker} will be to u use whatever {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and {pause} nonspeech . And , um ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And {disfmarker} and most , um , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a {disfmarker} a high - pass kind of characteristic {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: an upward slope . So having some kind of a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: uh , you know , at the beginning of a {disfmarker} of a {disfmarker} of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it will tend to have this high - frequency component . Whereas , {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency . Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: it plus energy plus timing information is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of {pause} what they were using then .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: So , yeah . It {disfmarker} it might be that what I did is {disfmarker} so , removes like {vocalsound} low , um , {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} low - energy , uh , speech frames . Because {pause} the way I do it is I just {disfmarker} I just combine the two decisions {disfmarker} so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} with the and {pause} operator . So , I only {pause} keep the frames where the two agree {pause} that it 's speech . So if the energy - based dropped {disfmarker} dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are lost . Mmm .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But s still , the way it 's done right now it {disfmarker} it helps on {disfmarker} on the noises where {disfmarker} it seems to help on the noises where {vocalsound} our VAD was not very {pause} good .\nProfessor B: Well , I guess {disfmarker} I mean , one could imagine combining them in different ways . But {disfmarker} but , I guess what you 're saying is that the {disfmarker} the MLP - based one has the spectral information . So .\nPhD C: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done {disfmarker} Well , yeah .\nProfessor B: Well , you can imagine {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is {disfmarker} So , it {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Is {disfmarker} ?\nPhD C: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are {disfmarker} are , uh , dropped , even if the , um , MLP decides to keep them .\nProfessor B: Right . Right . And that might not be optimal ,\nPhD C: But , yeah .\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: No\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker} I mean , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , a probability estimated by each one and {disfmarker} and put them together .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mmm . M Yeah .\nPhD A: Something that {disfmarker} that I 've used in the past is , um {disfmarker} when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . And you {pause} make your decision when the derivative is increasing for {pause} so many frames . Then you say that 's beginning of speech .\nPhD C: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: But , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . I guess it depends on how you do it . But {pause} I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's been a useful thing .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it . I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: then only make a decision because {pause} you still need to smooth the {pause} decision further .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD G: So that 's always there .\nPhD A: Yeah . OK .\nPhD C: Well , actually if I don't {disfmarker} maybe don't want to work too much of {disfmarker} on it right now . I just wanted to {disfmarker} to see if it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what I observed was the re was caused by this {disfmarker} this VAD problem .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And it seems to be the case . Um . Uh , the second thing is the {disfmarker} this spectral subtraction . Um . Um , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , uh , {nonvocalsound} twenty - five experiments , uh , with different , uh , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use {pause} an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} noise than the noise spectra that {pause} is estimated {pause} on the noise portion of the s uh , the utterances . So I tried several , uh , over - estimation factors . And after subtraction , I also add {pause} a constant noise , and I also try different , uh , {vocalsound} noise , uh , values and we 'll see what happen .\nProfessor B: Hmm . OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . But st still when we look at the , um {disfmarker} Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . Um . On the other hand , when you {pause} subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but {pause} maybe you distort a lot of speech . So . Well . Mmm . Well , it {disfmarker} until now , it doesn't seem to help . But We 'll see . So the next thing , maybe I {disfmarker} what I will {pause} try to {disfmarker} to do is just {pause} to try to smooth mmm , {vocalsound} the , um {disfmarker} to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right . Mmm .\nPhD G: Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ?\nPhD C: Yeah . So , to get something that 's {disfmarker} would be closer to {pause} what you tried to do with Wiener filtering .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD G: Actually , it 's , uh {disfmarker} Uh . I don't know , it 's {disfmarker} go ahead .\nPhD C: It {disfmarker}\nPhD G: And it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Maybe you can {disfmarker}\nPhD G: go ahead .\nPhD C: I think it 's {disfmarker} That 's it for me .\nPhD G: OK . So , uh {disfmarker} u th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . And there are {disfmarker} there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was {disfmarker} I was assuming that always the VAD {disfmarker} uh , the initial frames were silence . It always started in the silence state , but it wasn't for some utterances . So the {disfmarker} it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So this is on SpeechDat - Car Italian ?\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: So , in some cases s there are also {disfmarker}\nPhD G: SpeechDat - Car Italian . Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are .\nPhD C: o Uh - huh .\nPhD G: So that was one of the {pause} bugs that was there in estimating the noise . And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with {pause} different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the {disfmarker} the trend seems to be like , {vocalsound} uh , smoothing the {pause} current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like {pause} deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the {disfmarker} estimating the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like {disfmarker} it 's still comparable to the baseline . I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . And , uh , so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So there are three time constants that I have . So , I 'm just playing around . So , one is fixed in the line , like {pause} Smoothing the clean speech is {disfmarker} is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying {disfmarker} trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that {disfmarker} if some {disfmarker} In some cases the clean speech is , like {disfmarker} when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't {pause} vary a lot in the low - energy regions . And , uh . So . The results are , like {disfmarker} So far I 've been testing only with the {pause} baseline , which is {disfmarker} which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . I just want to separate the {disfmarker} the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , uh , just the spectral {disfmarker} I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . Um . And the other thing that I tried was {disfmarker} but I just {vocalsound} took of those , uh , {pause} {vocalsound} Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a {disfmarker} a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And it 's {disfmarker} it seems to be like it 's not {vocalsound} hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a {pause} four hertz {disfmarker} a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had . And so {disfmarker} Yeah . Just {disfmarker} just to see whether it really {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} is it worth trying or not . So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that . So there must be something that I can {disfmarker} that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess I would ask Carlos about that . I mean , how {disfmarker} how he derived those filters and {disfmarker} and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which {disfmarker} what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: This is cubic root of power spectra ?\nPhD G: Yeah . Cubic root of power spectrum .\nProfessor B: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . Right ?\nPhD G: Yeah . And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: So it has , like {disfmarker} the spectrogram has , like {disfmarker} Uh , it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's {disfmarker} there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So , those are the regions where there are , like {disfmarker} when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So . That 's {pause} something I observe using that filter . And {disfmarker} Yeah . There are a few {disfmarker} very {disfmarker} not a lot of {disfmarker} because the filter doesn't have a {disfmarker} really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ? OK ?\nProfessor B: OK . Why don't we read some digits ?\nPhD A: Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ?\nProfessor B: Sure .\nPhD A: Transcript L dash two one five .\nProfessor B: O K .", "answers": ["Grad F explained that he was focusing on writing his proposal for his qualification exams, which was on the 25th of July.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\nMarketing: Oh , okay ,\nUser Interface: No , I don't think so .\nMarketing: I think it's a technical thing\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: which our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and those waves have high {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nUser Interface: Twenty five . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: but we have to take this into account .\nUser Interface: Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: So anyway\nUser Interface: One of us {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\nUser Interface: Functions .\nMarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\nProject Manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\nMarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay .\nMarketing: this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .\nUser Interface: I got one question ,\nMarketing: I can go back .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nMarketing: Yeah one question ,\nUser Interface: uh you are a Market Expert\nMarketing: yeah ?\nUser Interface: so\nMarketing: I am . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: should we aim at the young people or not ?\nMarketing: I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , then teletext is used less .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: That's good point .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yep .\nUser Interface: Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: 'Kay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Of the technical function , so {vocalsound} uh\nMarketing: So I think it's you , huh ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's\nMarketing: No ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} That's me .\nProject Manager: what effect {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: techni function of {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , user requiremen\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . Wait a second .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Argh .\nIndustrial Designer: I have to do working design so uh\nProject Manager: So you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's {disfmarker} but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\nProject Manager: Okay . Let's go .\nUser Interface: So next slide please . And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\nMarketing: Makes sense . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: which one would you prefer ? I guess this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\nUser Interface: Sure , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like , between those two\nUser Interface: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple\nIndustrial Designer: li\nProject Manager: Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: simple desires into simple actions .\nMarketing: Nice . Nice sentence .\nUser Interface: Findings .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh sorry .\nUser Interface: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a really good style , it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So {disfmarker} Press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: It's off .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: It's on .\nUser Interface: the T_V_ turns on .\nMarketing: And when does it turn off ?\nUser Interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the {disfmarker} For for enough time\nMarketing: Oh so you have a\nUser Interface: like uh you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: sensing {disfmarker} sensor machine that uh knows {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's a question to our technical design , our {vocalsound} two engineers .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\nProject Manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's easy to do ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: you just control the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: According to your distance to {disfmarker} and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\nIndustrial Designer: Distance .\nUser Interface: According to the distance . {gap} Yeah yeah yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\nUser Interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . {gap}\nUser Interface: So , its main purpose in fact is a back light ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: which change colours ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: which makes it easier to find , and each can {disfmarker} it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: So basically that's it .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\nUser Interface: Can be easily done ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Just few actions , a few actions for everything .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . S\nUser Interface: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\nProject Manager: Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah and it {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: Okay , but it's quite universal you know .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: We can just extend it to any device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So for instance if I want to go to {disfmarker} directly to channel twenty five , how would I do {disfmarker} can I do that with this ?\nUser Interface: Uh twenty five .\nMarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact I would propose another solution .\nMarketing: Or is it ?\nUser Interface: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ?\nMarketing: Most people {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\nMarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: B yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number\nMarketing: Go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: and then it go\nMarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\nIndustrial Designer: t because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But still {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .\nProject Manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And it's only next .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah\nUser Interface: Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\nMarketing: so {disfmarker} but you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah. .\nUser Interface: Or say this can be back .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press {disfmarker} suppose two five they just press two and five\nMarketing: So it would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and you can change mode {disfmarker} zapping mode or\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Alright .\nProject Manager: uh current chan\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Listening more .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\nMarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Although I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright ? Thanks for your attention .\nProject Manager: Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry .\nProject Manager: You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .\nProject Manager: Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nProject Manager: On {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so that we just use simple recog\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Too complex .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: no but but {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\nMarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And what about the price of this component ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\nProject Manager: It mm {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: Hmm . Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,\nMarketing: Millions . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so we can make really simp\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we want to make really simple device\nMarketing: Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .\nMarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\nIndustrial Designer: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm .\nIndustrial Designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nMarketing: Couple of words .\nIndustrial Designer: then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nMarketing: Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\nProject Manager: No , in no not only speech , yeah .\nMarketing: It's on top of using the button .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I it's an option .\nUser Interface: Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .\nMarketing: Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key .\nUser Interface: Okay. .\nIndustrial Designer: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nMarketing: T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sho to to train , okay .\nUser Interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: roll 'em up\nIndustrial Designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nUser Interface: or roll 'em down .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer: because it's it's very expensive\nMarketing: no ?\nIndustrial Designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nProject Manager: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm why ?\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: And volume control .\nIndustrial Designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nMarketing: So but uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Wouldn't that make uh {vocalsound} arguments ?\nIndustrial Designer: They can make {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group discuss about speech recognition?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the group discuss about speech recognition?", "context": "Project Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\nMarketing: Oh , okay ,\nUser Interface: No , I don't think so .\nMarketing: I think it's a technical thing\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: which our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and those waves have high {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nUser Interface: Twenty five . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: but we have to take this into account .\nUser Interface: Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: So anyway\nUser Interface: One of us {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\nUser Interface: Functions .\nMarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\nProject Manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\nMarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay .\nMarketing: this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .\nUser Interface: I got one question ,\nMarketing: I can go back .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nMarketing: Yeah one question ,\nUser Interface: uh you are a Market Expert\nMarketing: yeah ?\nUser Interface: so\nMarketing: I am . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: should we aim at the young people or not ?\nMarketing: I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , then teletext is used less .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: That's good point .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yep .\nUser Interface: Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: 'Kay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Of the technical function , so {vocalsound} uh\nMarketing: So I think it's you , huh ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's\nMarketing: No ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} That's me .\nProject Manager: what effect {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: techni function of {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , user requiremen\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . Wait a second .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Argh .\nIndustrial Designer: I have to do working design so uh\nProject Manager: So you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's {disfmarker} but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\nProject Manager: Okay . Let's go .\nUser Interface: So next slide please . And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\nMarketing: Makes sense . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: which one would you prefer ? I guess this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\nUser Interface: Sure , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like , between those two\nUser Interface: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple\nIndustrial Designer: li\nProject Manager: Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: simple desires into simple actions .\nMarketing: Nice . Nice sentence .\nUser Interface: Findings .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh sorry .\nUser Interface: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a really good style , it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So {disfmarker} Press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: It's off .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: It's on .\nUser Interface: the T_V_ turns on .\nMarketing: And when does it turn off ?\nUser Interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the {disfmarker} For for enough time\nMarketing: Oh so you have a\nUser Interface: like uh you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: sensing {disfmarker} sensor machine that uh knows {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's a question to our technical design , our {vocalsound} two engineers .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\nProject Manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's easy to do ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: you just control the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: According to your distance to {disfmarker} and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\nIndustrial Designer: Distance .\nUser Interface: According to the distance . {gap} Yeah yeah yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\nUser Interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . {gap}\nUser Interface: So , its main purpose in fact is a back light ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: which change colours ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: which makes it easier to find , and each can {disfmarker} it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: So basically that's it .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\nUser Interface: Can be easily done ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Just few actions , a few actions for everything .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . S\nUser Interface: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\nProject Manager: Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah and it {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: Okay , but it's quite universal you know .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: We can just extend it to any device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So for instance if I want to go to {disfmarker} directly to channel twenty five , how would I do {disfmarker} can I do that with this ?\nUser Interface: Uh twenty five .\nMarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact I would propose another solution .\nMarketing: Or is it ?\nUser Interface: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ?\nMarketing: Most people {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\nMarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: B yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number\nMarketing: Go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: and then it go\nMarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\nIndustrial Designer: t because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But still {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .\nProject Manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And it's only next .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah\nUser Interface: Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\nMarketing: so {disfmarker} but you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah. .\nUser Interface: Or say this can be back .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press {disfmarker} suppose two five they just press two and five\nMarketing: So it would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and you can change mode {disfmarker} zapping mode or\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Alright .\nProject Manager: uh current chan\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Listening more .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\nMarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Although I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright ? Thanks for your attention .\nProject Manager: Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry .\nProject Manager: You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .\nProject Manager: Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nProject Manager: On {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so that we just use simple recog\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Too complex .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: no but but {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\nMarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And what about the price of this component ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\nProject Manager: It mm {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: Hmm . Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,\nMarketing: Millions . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so we can make really simp\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we want to make really simple device\nMarketing: Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .\nMarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\nIndustrial Designer: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm .\nIndustrial Designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nMarketing: Couple of words .\nIndustrial Designer: then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nMarketing: Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\nProject Manager: No , in no not only speech , yeah .\nMarketing: It's on top of using the button .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I it's an option .\nUser Interface: Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .\nMarketing: Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key .\nUser Interface: Okay. .\nIndustrial Designer: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nMarketing: T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sho to to train , okay .\nUser Interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: roll 'em up\nIndustrial Designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nUser Interface: or roll 'em down .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer: because it's it's very expensive\nMarketing: no ?\nIndustrial Designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nProject Manager: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm why ?\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: And volume control .\nIndustrial Designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nMarketing: So but uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Wouldn't that make uh {vocalsound} arguments ?\nIndustrial Designer: They can make {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm .

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding\u2014we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the\u00a0seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one\u2014that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those\u2014. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have\u2014and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there\u2014one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not\u2014and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out\u00a0to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within\u00a0densely urban areas,\u00a0where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd\u2014the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer.\u00a0Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course\u2014in short order\u2014as well. So, we\u00a0have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for\u00a0the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that\u00a0there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with\u2014. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here\u00a0with capacity,\u00a0whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision,\u00a0whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding\u00a0that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of\u00a0the well-known ones\u2014and I've spoken\u00a0about\u00a0this before\u2014is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a\u00a0family tradition of doing childcare\u00a0within\u00a0the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered,\u00a0unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that\u00a0isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I\u00a0have to say. So, some of the aspects are cultural, but what we're also doing\u00a0alongside this, whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we\u00a0learnt from the pilot roll-out, is that communication with\u00a0parents and providers and local authorities as well. So, we have a whole programme running alongside it. It's about communicating what the offer is, how\u00a0simple it is to get invovled in this and\u00a0where they go to, and, critically, I think, how we do that national roll-out would be important as well.\nHefin David AM: So, given the point you've made about\u00a0grandparents and family, wouldn't it be sensible, then, to offer a subsidy to\u00a0grandparents to provide this kind of care?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Unregistered grandparents?\nHefin David AM: Well, through some kind of analysis of that.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, we don't think so and there are good reasons behind this.\nHefin David AM: Is it because you say that they wouldn't be registered as\u00a0carers for their own family member?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but there's a deeper reason behind that\u00a0registration as well. The childcare offer isn't only to just provide childcare; it's the wider aspects\u00a0that come\u00a0with this.\u00a0This childcare offer ties into\u00a0the foundation years offer. There's an element of education linked to the\u00a0childcare offer\u2014there's that 10\u00a0hours of the early education foundation years as well. The two tie together. So, there's an issue here with quality, about socialisation and how children learn in an environment, as opposed to purely\u2014as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are\u2014simply child-minding. That's one\u00a0important distinction. So, the\u00a0focus of this scheme is very much on registered\u00a0licensed providers, which could be, by the way\u2014because we do have them, and we're discussing this at the moment internally and with the\u00a0Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years\u00a0and others\u2014grandparents\u00a0who are actually registered and\u00a0inspected by the care inspectorate? We're having\u00a0those discussions.\nHefin David AM: How many of them are there?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We don't think there is a huge number, but we're trying to\u00a0bottom this out at the moment. We haven't got\u00a0the exact number, but we don't think they are huge numbers, but there are, in our constituencies, registered, licensed, inspected grandparents who look after other\u00a0people's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven, but also their own grandchildren.\nHefin David AM: So, they're a kind of grandparents club.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes. Now that, I would say to you\u2014and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well\u2014is markedly different in the nature of it, because it's\u00a0registered and licensed, than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles. I say that as well\u00a0because we also get\u00a0people who will say to us, 'I don't\u00a0want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren; I look after my grandchildren\u00a0because I look after them'.\nHefin David AM: And what about the view, given that you said that\u00a0capacity\u00a0wasn't an issue, of the National Day Nurseries\u00a0Association, which says that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I don't agree we have the most fragile, but the childcare offer gives us an\u00a0opportunity to make it more\u00a0resilient and more robust. We know from the\u00a0early piloting, and as we roll it out, that there is the immense diversity\u00a0within the childcare sector, and we're talking about\u00a0everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children,\u00a0to large, complex environments that perhaps\u00a0are on maintained premises within school premises, provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation. So, there's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales, and we also know there's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer. What the roll-out allows us to do, backed by \u00a360 million of capital money behind it, in terms of capital development of childcare facilities, backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare\u2014and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well\u2014that means, by 2020, we get to the point where we're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development, because\u00a0in some areas we're finding it's not to do with lack of provision and facilities, it's to do with lack of staff. In other areas, we're finding there are plenty of staff but not the adequate facilities. We've got to get it right.\nHefin David AM: That's fair enough, but is it realistic to think that there's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product? Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, I think it is, absolutely, because, again, what we're finding is we've got several things going on at once in terms of how we monitor and assess the development\u00a0of this roll-out. One is the work that we're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out, so we're literally learning live time, and I have pretty much weekly or fortnightly updates on how things are going, but also there is a termly update as well. We've also commissioned additional work from\u00a0Arad to look at this first phase of the roll-out that we've done to see what that tells us as well. But the feedback that we're getting from the childcare providers themselves, on the basis that we're now identifying where either the gaps in the workforce or the physical facilities are, is that, 'Yes, we can do this', because\u00a0we're putting the money in, we have the strategy for the workforce development, and it's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales. It's not as if what we're saying is, 'Here's what we're going to do all of a sudden\u2014flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere.' So, let me give you one key example. Alongside this, alongside\u00a0the \u00a360 million capital fund, alongside\u00a0the workforce development, we've also identified a separate\u00a0strain of money into cylch meithrin. We know that there is a shortage in parts of Wales for Welsh language childcare development. We're specifically putting money into developing that, and, in fact, the first one of those will be, from\u00a0that new tranche of money, opening up, I think, in September. They anticipate, as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development, we'll have an additional 40 of those by\u2014\nJo-Anne Daniels: Thirty.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's an additional 30 by 2020, and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years\u00a0after that.\u00a0We can't take this for granted, Hefin. This is difficult. This is hard work, but we have everything in place to make it happen.\nHefin David AM: The last thing from me: the \u00a34.50 single national rate\u2014is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of EasyJet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because\u00a0of the add-ons?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it, I have to say, not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities. The\u00a0first thing to say is the \u00a34.50 rate that we've set has been welcomed, and it's been welcomed because it's unlike the much more complex offer that's in England, where there's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it's added complexity\u00a0and confusion.\nHefin David AM: Can I just ask there, it's been welcomed perhaps\u00a0in Blaenau Gwent, but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, because\u00a0we haven't rolled it out in Cardiff yet, and that is a salient point.\nHefin David AM: Okay, fair enough. But will it be, then?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, it will be. Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying, 'Please can we have this offer?', and we are keen to give it to them. But, as I say\u2014\nHefin David AM: But do you anticipate\u00a0a capacity\u00a0problem with the \u00a34.50 in those areas, compared to, say, the Cynon valley?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We can't anticipate\u00a0it yet,\u00a0Hefin, but that's exactly the reason\u00a0for going into that area and then assessing how it works. We're reasonably confident that the \u00a34.50\u2014. We're reasonably assured by the feedback that we're having that the \u00a34.50 might work as a universal amount. But if we learn, when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport, that there needs to be some variation, we can look at that, because we're not doing a big-bang approach. So, that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it, but at the moment, I have to say, the \u00a34.50 amount has been welcomed\u2014it's appropriate. You touched on the other aspect, though, of the wider aspects of beyond the \u00a34.50, because\u00a0the \u00a34.50 doesn't cover everything.\u00a0The \u00a34.50 is a contribution\u00a0towards the wraparound childcare element but it doesn't cover\u2014and we agonised over this\u2014the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this. Now, we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are. I have to say, this hasn't been ivory-tower stuff; it's been in discussion with the providers but also parents.\u00a0One: parents are quite used to\u2014with childcare settings and play care settings and so on\u2014the idea that providers are quite different. Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents\u2014and I'm used to this as a parent myself, although mine are older now\u2014'Mr Irranca-Davies, when you sign on, just to be aware, if we do take your kids down to St Fagans, there's going to be a little bit of a charge for that' and so on.\nHefin David AM: That's fair enough, but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that, because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons, the lower income ones won't. Isn't that a concern?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: If money was absolutely no object, then I think you'd be looking at quite a different offer, but it has to be affordable within what we've got as well. The fact that parents, including those who are on lower incomes, are used to currently discriminating between providers, not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well, where very often schools now will say, 'We're doing something extra'\u2014\nHefin David AM: That may be the case, but it's not fair, is it?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: In a pure argument about equity, and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money\u2014'You can do what you want'\u2014I think you'd be looking at a very different approach. But within what we have, I think this works very, very well indeed, because it's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions. It says, 'Here you have 10 hours of the foundation education offer. You have the additional hours here provided with the childcare offer. But\u00a0within those additional hours, you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says, \"Within that we provide everything\"; you may be with a provider that says, \"Well, actually, we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips, but it's up to you if you want to come, and here's the additional cost\u2014\".' Parents are used to making that decision and realistically, in terms of what we can do with this offer, this is actually\u2014the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily\u00a0disadvantage. In a total fairness argument, would you make it universal and with no additional charges? Well, possibly you would. But we work within the realistic\u2014\nHefin David AM: Or have a lower top-end income limit.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Depending on how the Bill progresses in the main Chamber and when it goes through committee, there's that flexibility built into the Bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted. For the moment, I think there is an attraction, in terms of the upper limit, of saying: one\u2014'Let's try not to add additional complexity, let's go with a scheme that's already working its way through the system, which is, if you like, what they're doing in England, and not add additional complexity. But, secondly, there is an appeal to universality, curiously, in saying to all parents\u2014and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here\u2014there's an attraction when you say, 'Let's make an offer focused on working parents as it is', as universal to those working parents as possible, and avoid the administrative costs of saying, 'Well, let's take the upper limit down to \u00a380 or \u00a360 or \u00a355.' There's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity. We have looked at it.\nLynne Neagle AM: Darren on this.\nDarren Millar AM: Just to ask, I mean, the labour market costs are changing, aren't they? You've got the national living wage increasing\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014that's going to have a bearing, isn't it, on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the \u00a34.50 per hour regime? By the time it's fully rolled out, of course, that \u00a34.50 rate is going to be a number of years old, for example. Do you have plans to review that? Where is it headed? Because it's certainly not going to be enough in the future.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It depends how far in the future you're looking. I have to say, the feedback that we're having at the moment from organisations like the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and from the National Day Nurseries Association Wales and others is that this is the right rate and it's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable\u00a0future of rolling this out.\nDarren Millar AM: But they've raised concerns about the national living\u00a0wage implications, haven't they, as well?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Of course, and I think it's incumbent on us as well to not\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: So, it's not fair to say that they haven't raised concerns about the rate.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but what they're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised.\nDarren Millar AM: But they have suggested that in meetings\u2014\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That in future\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: Absolutely.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, of course, in future, any Minister, any committee, will want to come back and look at\u2014is the hourly rate, as one element of the scheme, appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector, and not least, by the way, as we try not only to develop the workforce, but to develop the career pathways through this as well? And I think that's the right discussion to be had, live time, as this is taken forward. But at this moment in time, we're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount.\nDarren Millar AM: So, have you forecasted\u00a0for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project? Because\u00a0you've still got this \u00a3100 million price tag on it, haven't you?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Similar to the point that was raised with Hefin about Cardiff and Newport, if we identify that the rate is not appropriate, if it's\u2014. I don't think anybody's going to come back to us and say that it's too little. But do bear in mind that it's above where the average England rate is, even though there's this complex variability\u00a0within the English\u00a0rate that has caused some confusion there, which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed. If we find, as we pilot it, or if we find because\u00a0there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in, there needs to be adjustment, then we'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case.\nDarren Millar AM: But that won't put the project at risk in terms of its finances?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, no. We are still very confident, looking forward, on the best projections we have, fed by the live input that's coming in from the pilot, which will be fed again in the autumn\u2014the Arad\u00a0report coming forward\u2014that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this\u2014challenging as this is, we have the capacity to deliver it\u2014but also that the funding that's available, on our best estimate\u2014the estimate we've stood by, that broad ball park of that \u00a3100 million figure\u2014it's deliverable within that. But if it changes, we will come back. And if it changes, I'll have to be sitting down with my boss, Vaughan Gething, and with Mark Drakeford, to argue the case on it. But at this moment, we have confidence and we've run the rule across\u00a0this repeatedly. But that rate, combined with the other elements of this childcare offer\u2014there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out.\nLynne Neagle AM: Mark on this.\nMark Reckless AM: Minister, as a parent who's been researching childcare options, it's obvious to me that in Cardiff, and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire, costs are substantially higher than this, and I haven't\u00a0been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for \u00a327, which is implied by your rate. Isn't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you're going to need a higher rate to make it work? Isn't that already obvious? Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Chair, my biggest fear is a parent who's actually involved in this area already, but, having been one myself\u2014. Mark, you may be right, that's exactly why we're piloting it and that's why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport, we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability\u00a0and the \u00a34.50 per hour rate.\nMark Reckless AM: But you're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I've referred to.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No. We will be. We are going to be.\nMark Reckless AM: When are you starting?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Cardiff and Newport\u2014September.\nOwain Lloyd: This September.\nMark Reckless AM: This September?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes. So, we're not missing any of these learning\u00a0experiences and we know that\u2014. The reason we've gone for the other areas first, by the way\u2014please take this back to any authorities affected\u2014is simply because we've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales, areas in north Wales, areas around Welsh language provision, areas in deep valleys, understanding\u00a0the cultural and the economic impacts. So, we've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision. But it's coming, it's imminent, and we'll learn the lessons from it. And do you know, you may be right? And if you are right, that it's more expensive, and we need a higher rate within\u00a0those areas, then we're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee. But let's go in and learn it first of all, rather than assume it necessarily.\nLynne Neagle AM: Just before I bring David in on the issue that Hefin raised about the chargeable\u00a0items, your paper says that providers can charge up to \u00a37.50 a day for food, snacks, transport and consumables such as nappies. Now, that's \u00a337.50 a week, which is a lot of money for parents, and I just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure?\u00a0But also, do you think there's a risk\u00a0that providers who maybe aren't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think they're the right areas to flag up, and if I thought that was going to happen I'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme. I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that\u2014whether or not, within the pilot areas that we are already in, which are quite diverse, that is happening. We're only one term into learning the lessons, by the way, but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families. So, the early evaluation, I think, will give us good feedback on that. I think also, by the way, that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here. It's not in their interests, I have to say, as the umbrella bodies or individual providers, to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families. This is about providing opportunities for all working families. But especially, I have to say, the early evaluation that we've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts\u2014in the early evaluation\u2014are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales. That's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it, and we don't want them then being priced out because of add-ons. So, there has to be some pragmatism, I have to say, and some open partnership working here with the sector, and we do have that.\nLynne Neagle AM: John on this.\nJohn Griffiths AM: I want to come back to the \u00a34.50 rate, but in terms of working with the sector, briefly, if I might, Chair, I just wonder, Huw, in terms of that \u00a34.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales, to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity? Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability, around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well. This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says, 'Here we've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it', because we recognise that there's great diversity in provision out there, and we also recognise that things will change over time. It's not only the geographical diversity\u2014it's the diversity of the sector itself. I think we need to, as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out, continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have. Just to flag up one issue, it's right that we're focusing on those elements that aren't included within it, to some extent as well, and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families, but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well. Let me give you a clear illustration: some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well, it would add something like in the region of 50p to that \u00a34.50 rate. That would have, at this moment, impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it. I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now, okay? But, it's that open dialogue with the sector that says, 'There's one thing about what you're saying you demand as a market; there's another thing about what we're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers' money to actually put into this'. They also understand, John, that as well as an enabling policy\u2014and we're seeing the evidence, by the way; I can cite it\u2014of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work, increase their hours and so on, this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of Wales. The stuff that's being debated ad nauseam here within the Assembly about foundational sectors\u2014. The sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity, including, by the way, not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations, such as exist in Neath and elsewhere that I was involved\u00a0in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up\u2014that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well. They know that. They know there is job creation within this and there's economic impact for that. So, it's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely, 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we've come up with \u00a34.50.'\nLynne Neagle AM: David, you had a question on the pilots.\nDavid Rees AM: Yes, just to finish that section off, if I may, Chair. Before I go to my question, I want to come back to Mark Reckless's question and the answer you gave. I got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas, you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate. Is that also on the cards?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: David, it's possible. I think our preference would be, I have to say, to stick with the universal rate, because we know it's\u2014. There's real simplicity and it's been welcomed in the sector. But the sector, also, are quite pragmatic about this. One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision. If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas, then we'll have to look at that, but there might be other ways of splicing it. But first of all, I think we have to go in and see how does this work. We might find, Mark, we might find, David, that we go in and when everything is tallied up, the \u00a34.50 per hour works in supporting provision there.\nDavid Rees AM: Okay. In your answer to John, you talked about affordability, which I totally understand. If I can now remind you: I don't remember the word 'affordability' coming in the manifesto pledge of the Government. It was 'we will offer childcare facilities'. So, I just want to put a reminder to you there.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Ministers always look at affordability.\nDavid Rees AM: Well, voters don't. In the situation regarding Welsh-medium, you answered that a little bit earlier, but I have concerns about capacity. Workforce capacity you've mentioned. To actually be registered you need staff who are qualified. There's clearly a need to get more staff, because in your own paper you say that the report in 2016 said you do not have the childcare capacity in Wales at the moment. Do you believe that you can actually deliver the workforce to meet that capacity, first of all through the English medium, but secondly through the Welsh medium as well? Because there's a clear need to look at it. You talk about 30 by 2020. By the way, 30 is nothing big when you consider the whole of Wales. Do you actually think you've got that workforce capacity set up before this is fully rolled out?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I hope, Chair, you'll appreciate that in our submission to you we've been very open. This is challenging. This is. To get to where we want to go is a huge challenge. Can we do it? Yes we can. And I don't say that glibly. Let me suggest some of the ways why. We have confidence that we can do this if everybody is working together across the sector, across the local authorities. Let me talk broadly about capacity, first of all, including English and Welsh-medium provision for children with complex needs, provision for children with disabilities\u2014all of this. First of all, this is being\u2014. The work that we're doing to increase both capacity in terms of trained staff and qualified staff: we have the 10-year plan that I mentioned, which has already been announced. We're working through it. We're working through it with the sector. So, we're identifying not only broadly at a national level where we need to develop those qualifications, but also at a regional, geographic level as well, and that's being taken forward. We've engaged with the 22 authorities\u2014not just the pilot areas as well on this. So, beyond the pilot areas, we also have intense engagement. As you can see from what I've said before, it's rolling out progressively, but with all 22 authorities we're working with them on their childcare sufficiency assessments to identify where their shortages are.\nDavid Rees AM: What have the pilot programmes actually shown you about this, and how are you going to move this forward?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, it's precisely that. So, within the pilot areas, we have a greater depth of analysis now of where both the workforce and the physical provisions are. Whether those are maintained or non-maintained or third sector or school facilities or whatever, we've got a much deeper granulation of identifying where that is, and we're working, then, with those authorities, with the capital moneys that we've allocated to this and the workforce development, and with local colleges, to develop the workforce and the physical constraints. But we're also doing that with the other 22, with all the 22 authorities as well, in anticipation of the wider roll-out. They're not being left out of this. And by the way, it's not only the Cardiffs and the Newports; it's all the other ones where there isn't full roll-out. We're engaged with them deeply at the moment with that analysis on their childcare sufficiency assessments, both in terms of workforce, but also physical provision. So, we're doing that already. We are looking as well, as this is rolled out, around the issue of co-location. Now, co-location is a fruitful way to look at future development. It doesn't mean, by the way, that we exclude the third sector or social enterprise approach, or the independent sector, but co-location could be key to the roll-out of this in the right areas where it can be done, because then we avoid any\u00a0fracture between the education hours and the childcare hours: the physical transportation of children from one location to another. So, we're engaged with the 22 authorities on that: where could that be developed, who would be the providers that would do it and do they have the workforce to scale up to do it? If not, how do they talk to local colleges to do that? So, we're doing that at the moment. I mentioned we've put the \u00a31 million additional funding into the meithrin over the next two years, targeting\u00a040 new Welsh-medium groups by 2021, which pretty much coincides with the full roll-out of this. It's part of the aim of an additional 150 over the next decade of meithrin. So, all of those things, David, give us a confidence that we're going to be in the right place.\nDavid Rees AM: But in particular, take the Welsh language\u2014I understand Gwynedd, and I won't ask another question on that for obvious reasons at this point in time\u2014but in some of the other areas where you've piloted, you've gone partial in some areas. When there's Welsh language education, and the three to five-year-olds go to schools, they go from all areas of the council, basically. They don't actually go necessarily from the local area, and therefore you're getting a different picture. Have you been able to assess the actual impact, properly, upon the Welsh-medium side of things? Because, for example, my grandchildren will go from my area, which may not be in one of the considerations, to a school that may be in that consideration, and that happens regularly.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely. We know that historically we've got, across the country, a shortage of Welsh-language childcare provision\u2014meithrin and so on\u2014but we have not only a strategy in place, but the fact that we've got local authorities now doing their own assessments within their area, across the piste of childcare, but also in terms of Welsh language, that means then that we can start filling those gaps with the money we've put to it, and that includes in all parts of Wales, including those areas within south Wales and others that are less deep in their tradition of speaking Welsh over recent history, anyway, but where the demand for it is massive. So, local authorities are tasked with doing their own assessments of childcare sufficiency for this childcare offer. They're identifying the gaps, David, and we will work with them and with providers to fill those gaps, and that includes with the umbrella organisations for Welsh language childcare provision.\nDavid Rees AM: And that's the same for those children with physical disabilities or learning disabilities.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely the same. Absolutely the same. And this does mean, Chair, that it will be different, as it currently is in different areas: the type of provision, where the provision is located. But the provision should be there. This offer won't happen unless the provision is there for those children with complex needs, children with disabilities, Welsh language provision, as well as more generic provision as well, but it will be diverse in its provision around areas.\nLynne Neagle AM: I do want to move on now, John, so if I can come back to your question. Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: I would like to pick up on the last point, if I may.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. The investment in meithrin, of course, is one that we all welcome. A question from me though, the wider question, is: how do we mainstream Welsh medium into childcare? Because, clearly, leaving it to meithrin is one way of doing it, but there's a lot of existing infrastructure out there that we need to upskill in terms of the provision of Welsh medium. So, it's not a question as such, but I'm sure you recognise that\u2014that there is a challenge there. Because if we are to get to where we want to get to, it isn't about growing meithrin, or Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin; it's about mainstreaming Welsh-medium provision within the wider sector. So, it wasn't a question after all. So, looking at the manifesto commitment that was made in 2016, clearly the main or the principal aim of this policy is around removing some of the barriers to secure employment for parents, albeit with very positive outcomes for the children themselves, and we don't ignore or neglect that at any cost. But I'm just wondering: how would you then reconcile that with the findings of the Public Policy Institute for Wales report, which I mentioned to you yesterday, which was commissioned by the Government to look at policy options in this context, which concluded that there will be no 'substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children' and that 'the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers in families with a child of target age is extremely small'?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, the first thing I would say is that what we're learning from the pilots is that it is having real-life impacts on parents, including in disadvantaged families, and we're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground, where parents are making different choices in the areas where it's being piloted. So, the types of different choices they're making could be to expand the number of hours that they're in work, because they now have a choice, they're not constrained to certain hours or whatever, they have a wider choice, with a wider number of providers, and they're making that decision and they're able to expand their hours. Some, by the way, Llyr,\u00a0I have to say\u2014and, again, these are real-life situations\u2014are saying, 'What we're doing is not expanding our hours, but, because of the increased provision of childcare and the increased offer, we are now able to actually spend more time with our children, because we're adjusting our hours of work, based on the childcare provision offer.'\u00a0That in itself, I have to say, is a worthy aim. But I would say what we found out, in real-life examples\u2014I'm not saying that in direct contrast to what that paper was saying\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: That's what I was going to ask; it sounds as if you're saying they were wrong.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: But what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out, where we are learning, live time, and I think the Arad report in October\u2014we're hoping to see the final report in October\u2014will help put some flesh on this as well. It is already having an effect: the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage, they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand, take more hours, adjust their own lifestyles around it or more. So, it's having a positive effect. I can cite to you examples, because I've asked my own officials on this, of families who tell us they're saving up to \u00a3250 a week on the basis of this offer within the pilot areas, who've increased their hours of employment, who've changed their working patterns to suit their work life, but also to suit their families. Now, that's real stuff, as opposed to\u2014yes.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, in effect, you are saying that the PPIW\u00a0report got it wrong, basically.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, I'm not saying that they got it wrong and it's wholly wrong, but it is interesting, within that report, that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this. It's not only the childcare; it is the transport, it's the training and education, it's the employment support and all of those. And we agree with that, but we do think, and what we're seeing, live time, at the moment\u2014maybe at some point, somebody else will produce a report beyond the Arad\u00a0report in October that will say, 'Well, actually, the way this is designed, that they've done it in Wales, is having a material effect on those families, particularly the most disadvantaged families.'\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: But you're asking us to support a Bill here, albeit a framework Bill, to achieve a policy aim where you're giving us anecdotal evidence that it's having an impact, contrary to research that's previously been done, albeit with promises that, maybe, an evaluation sometime in the autumn might tell us a different story.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We know, and we are constantly told\u2014I'm sure this is commonplace in constituency surgeries, as well\u2014by parents who say that the biggest mitigating factor for them, actually, either going into work at an earlier opportunity or expanding their hours is purely the cost of childcare in front of them. We are picking up, even from the early term of the analysis\u2014. I think our further reports, both Arad and as we go forward with the pilots, will substantiate this more. It'll go beyond the anecdotal, it will show that parents are having an enhanced opportunity to balance their work life, to make better choices, either in terms of expanding the number of hours they're working and increasing their disposable income within their families, or actually making it simply better for them in their family situation, where they don't currently have that offer. So, I get the fact that we have one report out there, but it's one report. It's a report, and we're not dismissing it entirely, but what we are saying is: we are now working with real-life piloting of an offer, and we are seeing the benefits coming through. As we roll this out, we'll be back in front of this committee saying, 'Well, this is now what we're finding. We can go beyond the real-life stories that I'm relating to you now, and we can say, \"Well, here's some hard data that goes with this, as well.\"'\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. You reference in your paper, as well, another report, which is the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0report, 'Starting Strong 2017', and it highlights countries that have, maybe, the most similar childcare offer to what's being proposed here in Wales. I'm just wondering what assessment you've made of those similarities, because, clearly, there'll be different economic contexts in different countries and different levels of public expenditure, et cetera.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We haven't done really detailed analysis of comparisons with other countries far from Wales, but we will be doing work\u00a0that will be doing some benchmarking against, where we can find similar models, where appropriate\u2014do some appropriate benchmarking. What we have been doing is looking at what's been happening across the border in England and trying to learn from the lessons there, and also the offer in Scotland as well, which are both close to hand. They're in quite similar contexts. But we will do some work, Llyr, around benchmarking against good comparative international examples, where appropriate.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, there we are, because one of my concerns was that the focus in a number of the countries in the OECD report are for nought to three-year-olds, whereas, of course, the policy focus here is for a slightly older age group.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, and I fully get that, but again, and I know it can be said, 'Well, this is an example' but it's real-life examples. We are having people who are telling us that they're now making the choice to go to work earlier because\u00a0this is extended to three-year-olds, but they would have delayed. There is a direct outcome\u00a0there if this childcare offer enables somebody to say, 'Well, I'm going to go a year earlier back into work and bring income into the family.'\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. So, moving on, then, to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness, of course, which is an important one to address. Clearly, one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children, hopefully, later on in life. I want to come back to this point that the Children's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised: the concern that, actually, the most disadvantaged\u2014those from workless households\u2014are being excluded from this policy. Isn't there therefore a risk that they'll be left even further behind?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I've had long, detailed and positive discussions with the children's commissioner on this, and I know the children's commissioner would want a more universal offer, but I make two points on that: one is, that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was, and it's not the offer that's being taken forward now. It is a different thing, a universal offer, and there\u00a0are issues around that with complexity, and also affordability. But it isn't the offer that we took forward into Government; this is what we're taking forward. But it is interesting\u00a0in terms of that aspect of families then who lose out. I'd say two significant things on it: one is, this doesn't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare. Within this, there are 10 hours of the foundation years, educational input, which is there for everybody. But before that, particularly for those disadvantaged families, before we even get to that stage, you have schemes such as Flying Start, and I know this committee has looked in detail at Flying Start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere. If I had all the money under the sun, I would really do that, Chair; I would really do it. But I don't have all the money under the sun.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: But you do have the ability to target the money.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but the fact that Flying Start, we know, is leading to those outcomes where those children, in quite challenged circumstances very often, are more ready to step up to the foundation year, are more ready, then, to step through into mainstream education in later years\u2014those things tie together. So, there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family, by the way, within this offer, let alone the childcare. That doesn't mean that everybody's excluded, but it does mean, yes, that this offer is focused on working parents. And we don't think that that's a bad thing. In fact, it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election, which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags, which is, 'I can't afford to go back to work because I can't afford the childcare. Don't tell me to go back to work, I can't afford it.'\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The majority of disadvantaged children don't live in Flying Start areas, do they?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, indeed.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, there's a missing cohort there that can't access one or the other, and the school readiness gap is growing, and, really, are we focusing our resources in the right place here?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, yes, in terms of this scheme, but it doesn't sit alone as this scheme\u2014it's the wider plethora of, I have to say, progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different\u00a0forms. It's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents, and readiness not only for the parents and for their children, but also the support into work. So, if, for example, you look at the Parents, Childcare and Employment programme, which is separate from this, there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families. If you look at the support for the children, we've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education, but we've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation, education and so on and so forth. If you look at this solely on its own and say, 'Well, there is nothing else there;\u00a0the rest of Wales is a desert and there's no support for parents, for getting parents back into work or for\u00a0those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education',\u00a0I'd be worried. But, actually, this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in Wales, where I think we are well ahead of the other nations. Yes, we could do more, and I always say, Llyr; I always say, Chair, that if I had\u2014I don't have a chequebook at all, because it's not in my gift\u2014if I had a blank cheque I'd do a lot more, but we don't. But what we can do is get the right schemes in place, and if this helps drive more choices for working parents, including, by the way\u2014.\u00a0There are niceties within this as well; it doesn't have to be that both parents are working. You could have a parent who is on incapacity benefit. You could have a parent who is a registered carer. They would qualify for the scheme. Those will be some of those most disadvantaged families that we both have those concerns about. So, there is some flexibility within this scheme as well to deal with some of those disadvantaged families.\nLynne Neagle AM: Darren on this.\nDarren Millar AM: I am surprised by the answer there,\u00a0particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations, when they're 16 years old. Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development, which could, of course, lead to a perverse outcome later on in life, but I don't want to ask you about that. If I can just very quickly ask you: has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they're in 16 hours or more of education each week? So, they may not be entering the labour market, but, of course, one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education, so what arrangements are in place there?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Darren, we have considered it, and we haven't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work, not into training to enable them to get into work. There are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth, but it's not this scheme.\nDarren Millar AM: But it's not prescribed support, is it? You know, it's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier. You must have done some costings, then, if you've considered it, and you must have tried to identify numbers.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I'm looking to my left and my right.\nOwain Lloyd: Not at this point.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We haven't\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: So, you haven't considered it that much, have you?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We have actually considered\u2014. We consider it from the point of, 'What is this scheme set up to do?' It's very clear. When we ran, in the manifesto on this point\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: I understand that. I don't want you to repeat yourself because I know we are against the clock. But, very specifically, when you say you've considered it, what you mean is you thought about it but you've not costed it, you've not identified the numbers that might be involved\u2014\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely, absolutely.\nDarren Millar AM: And therefore you've not considered whether it might be affordable in addition to the policy objective that this is trying to meet.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, Darren, you're right: we haven't considered affordability because we've considered it on first principles to do with what this offer is trying to do. It doesn't fit within the offer so, as such, why would we do the costings?\nDarren Millar AM: Perhaps I can frame my question in another way. Are you prepared to consider it if you're able to identify the numbers and potential cost?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Ah, right, okay.\u00a0We'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee, but it doesn't actually fit within the first principles of what the\u00a0scheme is designed to do. Darren, can I just pick up on your point, in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr?\u00a0I drew attention in my answer to Llyr\u00a0to schemes such as the PaCE scheme.\u00a0In Gwynedd,\u00a0one of our pilot areas, they\u00a0are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer. So, what they are doing is wrapping the support around. It is not the case, as you've suggested then, that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families. What this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision, and that's\u00a0the way we want to see it work. So, I wouldn't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families. Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works, and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme.\u00a0All families will qualify for the 10 hours\u00a0of education. In Gwynedd, they're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: But on the other hand, Minister, you've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it, and yet not all kids will be able to access it, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: But all children can access the 10 hours, and they can access Flying Start\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours, is it not?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: If they're in a Flying Start area.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: \u2014or they can be in a children's zone area or they can\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: If they're in those areas.\nLynne Neagle AM: Right, I've got John and then David, and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief, please.\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes, certainly, Chair. In terms of child development and how this fits with wider\u00a0Welsh Government strategy, Huw,\u00a0I'd be interested in what you'd have to say about the quality of childcare.\u00a0We're talking a lot about quantity, but obviously we want to up quality, and that's recognised by Welsh Government. They've talked about increasing the qualifications within the workforce, and the quality. I just wonder how that sits within the \u00a34.50, because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there, and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: John, you're absolutely right, and two things on that: I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward\u2014a very good independent sector-run childcare provision, with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other, and I asked the point about the integration, curiously, but\u00a0what they were doing was\u2014. Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we'd want to see: not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects\u2014. So, it was hard to differentiate, in some ways, what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding, and including the nutritional stuff and all of that. Now, that is the model we need to see, and the \u00a34.50 seems to work, at the moment, for that. It'll be interesting, as we discussed previously, as it goes forward\u2014. We need to look at whether that works, going forward. But the quality, I think, is key, and that's why we're focused very much on registered inspected providers, as opposed to every Tom, Dick and Harriet.\nJohn Griffiths AM: If we want to increase salary levels, though, which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality, then obviously that might impact on the \u00a34.50 rate.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, indeed, and we are cognisant\u2014. It's interesting that we focus on whether the \u00a34.50 is affordable, but the \u00a34.50\u2014you know, we're having an interesting discussion internally about how that \u00a34.50 offer per hour sits alongside others, such as the foundation phase offer, and it's more generous. So, I think it's: how do we align, as time goes by, the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff? Now, we're doing some fascinating work that I think I've referred to on this committee before about aligning the early years development entirely. Now, this is an evolving piece of work, but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that. How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development? It's not simply childcare.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Right. The next questions are from Mark.\nMark Reckless AM: In terms of child development and not accentuating disadvantage, another area where this may apply is the kids who are born in the summer term, compared to those who are born in Michaelmas. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they start with a disadvantage at school and often don't make that up, even as they go through school. What is the rationale for providing the older children with five terms of this, compared to three terms for the younger children who already have the relative disadvantage?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I'm looking to my colleagues here and\u2014\nJo-Anne Daniels: Well, the criteria for eligibility for the offer are the term after the child's third birthday, which is equivalent to the eligibility criteria for the foundation phase early education offer. Clearly, then, the number of terms that a child is able to, or parents are able to, access the childcare offer will be influenced by when the child is born,\u00a0but I think you may be referring to a sort of parallel question, which is about whether\u2014. There have been questions raised about whether children who are summer-born should, in fact, start school in the term after they turn four, or whether actually they should be allowed the flexibility to start school at a later age, which I know is something that has been tested in England, and there is some mixed evidence about school starting age and the birth month of children.\nMark Reckless AM: Well, they do have flexibility. You don't have to start your kids until the term following when they're five. That's the compulsory school\u2014\nJo-Anne Daniels: Well, that's the legal position, but, obviously, in practice, most children will start school in the term after they're four.\nMark Reckless AM: So, given the disadvantage we know that the younger children born in the summer have, relative to the older ones, why accentuate that by giving the older kids five terms of this project, which you tell us will have such positive effects on their child development, but the summer kids only get three? Doesn't\u00a0that make the situation worse?\nJo-Anne Daniels: I'm not 100 per cent sure I understand the question. So, children will stop being in receipt\u00a0of the childcare offer once they become eligible for a full-time school place, and most children will become eligible for a full-time school place in the term after their fourth birthday.\nMark Reckless AM: But the older kids become eligible for this five terms before they start school, where the younger kids, who're already disadvantaged, become eligible for it only three terms before, accentuating the problem, surely. Could more thought be given to this issue?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We'll take that away. It's confused us a little bit, but we'll take that away. We might need to come back to you and\u2014. Yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: If you could write to us about that, that would be helpful.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you. Minister, you got, or Welsh Government, really, got the Public Policy Institute for Wales to study this proposed policy and they concluded that it would have no substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children, and that the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what\u00a0I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income\u2014as I mentioned earlier, up to \u00a3250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples\u2014but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost \u00a361 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost \u00a3144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks\u2014beyond the term time and so on\u2014carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of \u00a326,000 in Wales\u2014 it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government\u00a0offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England\u2014the tax offer is more integrated\u2014has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every\u2014\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project\u2014people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right\u2014sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria\u2014you have a \u00a3100,000 cap, as well as the \u00a36,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC\u2014will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the \u00a37.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to\u2014well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you\u2014diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What were the two lessons that can be learned from early implementer areas?\nAnswer:", "input": "What were the two lessons that can be learned from early implementer areas?", "context": "Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding\u2014we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the\u00a0seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one\u2014that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those\u2014. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.\nHefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have\u2014and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there\u2014one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.\nHefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not\u2014and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out\u00a0to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within\u00a0densely urban areas,\u00a0where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd\u2014the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer.\u00a0Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course\u2014in short order\u2014as well. So, we\u00a0have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.\nHefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for\u00a0the services is not spread evenly across?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.\nHefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that\u00a0there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with\u2014. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here\u00a0with capacity,\u00a0whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision,\u00a0whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding\u00a0that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of\u00a0the well-known ones\u2014and I've spoken\u00a0about\u00a0this before\u2014is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a\u00a0family tradition of doing childcare\u00a0within\u00a0the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered,\u00a0unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that\u00a0isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I\u00a0have to say. So, some of the aspects are cultural, but what we're also doing\u00a0alongside this, whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we\u00a0learnt from the pilot roll-out, is that communication with\u00a0parents and providers and local authorities as well. So, we have a whole programme running alongside it. It's about communicating what the offer is, how\u00a0simple it is to get invovled in this and\u00a0where they go to, and, critically, I think, how we do that national roll-out would be important as well.\nHefin David AM: So, given the point you've made about\u00a0grandparents and family, wouldn't it be sensible, then, to offer a subsidy to\u00a0grandparents to provide this kind of care?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Unregistered grandparents?\nHefin David AM: Well, through some kind of analysis of that.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, we don't think so and there are good reasons behind this.\nHefin David AM: Is it because you say that they wouldn't be registered as\u00a0carers for their own family member?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but there's a deeper reason behind that\u00a0registration as well. The childcare offer isn't only to just provide childcare; it's the wider aspects\u00a0that come\u00a0with this.\u00a0This childcare offer ties into\u00a0the foundation years offer. There's an element of education linked to the\u00a0childcare offer\u2014there's that 10\u00a0hours of the early education foundation years as well. The two tie together. So, there's an issue here with quality, about socialisation and how children learn in an environment, as opposed to purely\u2014as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are\u2014simply child-minding. That's one\u00a0important distinction. So, the\u00a0focus of this scheme is very much on registered\u00a0licensed providers, which could be, by the way\u2014because we do have them, and we're discussing this at the moment internally and with the\u00a0Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years\u00a0and others\u2014grandparents\u00a0who are actually registered and\u00a0inspected by the care inspectorate? We're having\u00a0those discussions.\nHefin David AM: How many of them are there?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We don't think there is a huge number, but we're trying to\u00a0bottom this out at the moment. We haven't got\u00a0the exact number, but we don't think they are huge numbers, but there are, in our constituencies, registered, licensed, inspected grandparents who look after other\u00a0people's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven, but also their own grandchildren.\nHefin David AM: So, they're a kind of grandparents club.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes. Now that, I would say to you\u2014and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well\u2014is markedly different in the nature of it, because it's\u00a0registered and licensed, than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles. I say that as well\u00a0because we also get\u00a0people who will say to us, 'I don't\u00a0want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren; I look after my grandchildren\u00a0because I look after them'.\nHefin David AM: And what about the view, given that you said that\u00a0capacity\u00a0wasn't an issue, of the National Day Nurseries\u00a0Association, which says that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I don't agree we have the most fragile, but the childcare offer gives us an\u00a0opportunity to make it more\u00a0resilient and more robust. We know from the\u00a0early piloting, and as we roll it out, that there is the immense diversity\u00a0within the childcare sector, and we're talking about\u00a0everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children,\u00a0to large, complex environments that perhaps\u00a0are on maintained premises within school premises, provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation. So, there's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales, and we also know there's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer. What the roll-out allows us to do, backed by \u00a360 million of capital money behind it, in terms of capital development of childcare facilities, backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare\u2014and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well\u2014that means, by 2020, we get to the point where we're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development, because\u00a0in some areas we're finding it's not to do with lack of provision and facilities, it's to do with lack of staff. In other areas, we're finding there are plenty of staff but not the adequate facilities. We've got to get it right.\nHefin David AM: That's fair enough, but is it realistic to think that there's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product? Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, I think it is, absolutely, because, again, what we're finding is we've got several things going on at once in terms of how we monitor and assess the development\u00a0of this roll-out. One is the work that we're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out, so we're literally learning live time, and I have pretty much weekly or fortnightly updates on how things are going, but also there is a termly update as well. We've also commissioned additional work from\u00a0Arad to look at this first phase of the roll-out that we've done to see what that tells us as well. But the feedback that we're getting from the childcare providers themselves, on the basis that we're now identifying where either the gaps in the workforce or the physical facilities are, is that, 'Yes, we can do this', because\u00a0we're putting the money in, we have the strategy for the workforce development, and it's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales. It's not as if what we're saying is, 'Here's what we're going to do all of a sudden\u2014flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere.' So, let me give you one key example. Alongside this, alongside\u00a0the \u00a360 million capital fund, alongside\u00a0the workforce development, we've also identified a separate\u00a0strain of money into cylch meithrin. We know that there is a shortage in parts of Wales for Welsh language childcare development. We're specifically putting money into developing that, and, in fact, the first one of those will be, from\u00a0that new tranche of money, opening up, I think, in September. They anticipate, as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development, we'll have an additional 40 of those by\u2014\nJo-Anne Daniels: Thirty.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's an additional 30 by 2020, and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years\u00a0after that.\u00a0We can't take this for granted, Hefin. This is difficult. This is hard work, but we have everything in place to make it happen.\nHefin David AM: The last thing from me: the \u00a34.50 single national rate\u2014is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of EasyJet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because\u00a0of the add-ons?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it, I have to say, not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities. The\u00a0first thing to say is the \u00a34.50 rate that we've set has been welcomed, and it's been welcomed because it's unlike the much more complex offer that's in England, where there's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it's added complexity\u00a0and confusion.\nHefin David AM: Can I just ask there, it's been welcomed perhaps\u00a0in Blaenau Gwent, but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, because\u00a0we haven't rolled it out in Cardiff yet, and that is a salient point.\nHefin David AM: Okay, fair enough. But will it be, then?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, it will be. Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying, 'Please can we have this offer?', and we are keen to give it to them. But, as I say\u2014\nHefin David AM: But do you anticipate\u00a0a capacity\u00a0problem with the \u00a34.50 in those areas, compared to, say, the Cynon valley?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We can't anticipate\u00a0it yet,\u00a0Hefin, but that's exactly the reason\u00a0for going into that area and then assessing how it works. We're reasonably confident that the \u00a34.50\u2014. We're reasonably assured by the feedback that we're having that the \u00a34.50 might work as a universal amount. But if we learn, when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport, that there needs to be some variation, we can look at that, because we're not doing a big-bang approach. So, that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it, but at the moment, I have to say, the \u00a34.50 amount has been welcomed\u2014it's appropriate. You touched on the other aspect, though, of the wider aspects of beyond the \u00a34.50, because\u00a0the \u00a34.50 doesn't cover everything.\u00a0The \u00a34.50 is a contribution\u00a0towards the wraparound childcare element but it doesn't cover\u2014and we agonised over this\u2014the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this. Now, we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are. I have to say, this hasn't been ivory-tower stuff; it's been in discussion with the providers but also parents.\u00a0One: parents are quite used to\u2014with childcare settings and play care settings and so on\u2014the idea that providers are quite different. Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents\u2014and I'm used to this as a parent myself, although mine are older now\u2014'Mr Irranca-Davies, when you sign on, just to be aware, if we do take your kids down to St Fagans, there's going to be a little bit of a charge for that' and so on.\nHefin David AM: That's fair enough, but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that, because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons, the lower income ones won't. Isn't that a concern?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: If money was absolutely no object, then I think you'd be looking at quite a different offer, but it has to be affordable within what we've got as well. The fact that parents, including those who are on lower incomes, are used to currently discriminating between providers, not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well, where very often schools now will say, 'We're doing something extra'\u2014\nHefin David AM: That may be the case, but it's not fair, is it?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: In a pure argument about equity, and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money\u2014'You can do what you want'\u2014I think you'd be looking at a very different approach. But within what we have, I think this works very, very well indeed, because it's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions. It says, 'Here you have 10 hours of the foundation education offer. You have the additional hours here provided with the childcare offer. But\u00a0within those additional hours, you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says, \"Within that we provide everything\"; you may be with a provider that says, \"Well, actually, we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips, but it's up to you if you want to come, and here's the additional cost\u2014\".' Parents are used to making that decision and realistically, in terms of what we can do with this offer, this is actually\u2014the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily\u00a0disadvantage. In a total fairness argument, would you make it universal and with no additional charges? Well, possibly you would. But we work within the realistic\u2014\nHefin David AM: Or have a lower top-end income limit.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Depending on how the Bill progresses in the main Chamber and when it goes through committee, there's that flexibility built into the Bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted. For the moment, I think there is an attraction, in terms of the upper limit, of saying: one\u2014'Let's try not to add additional complexity, let's go with a scheme that's already working its way through the system, which is, if you like, what they're doing in England, and not add additional complexity. But, secondly, there is an appeal to universality, curiously, in saying to all parents\u2014and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here\u2014there's an attraction when you say, 'Let's make an offer focused on working parents as it is', as universal to those working parents as possible, and avoid the administrative costs of saying, 'Well, let's take the upper limit down to \u00a380 or \u00a360 or \u00a355.' There's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity. We have looked at it.\nLynne Neagle AM: Darren on this.\nDarren Millar AM: Just to ask, I mean, the labour market costs are changing, aren't they? You've got the national living wage increasing\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014that's going to have a bearing, isn't it, on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the \u00a34.50 per hour regime? By the time it's fully rolled out, of course, that \u00a34.50 rate is going to be a number of years old, for example. Do you have plans to review that? Where is it headed? Because it's certainly not going to be enough in the future.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It depends how far in the future you're looking. I have to say, the feedback that we're having at the moment from organisations like the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and from the National Day Nurseries Association Wales and others is that this is the right rate and it's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable\u00a0future of rolling this out.\nDarren Millar AM: But they've raised concerns about the national living\u00a0wage implications, haven't they, as well?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Of course, and I think it's incumbent on us as well to not\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: So, it's not fair to say that they haven't raised concerns about the rate.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but what they're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised.\nDarren Millar AM: But they have suggested that in meetings\u2014\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That in future\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: Absolutely.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, of course, in future, any Minister, any committee, will want to come back and look at\u2014is the hourly rate, as one element of the scheme, appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector, and not least, by the way, as we try not only to develop the workforce, but to develop the career pathways through this as well? And I think that's the right discussion to be had, live time, as this is taken forward. But at this moment in time, we're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount.\nDarren Millar AM: So, have you forecasted\u00a0for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project? Because\u00a0you've still got this \u00a3100 million price tag on it, haven't you?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Similar to the point that was raised with Hefin about Cardiff and Newport, if we identify that the rate is not appropriate, if it's\u2014. I don't think anybody's going to come back to us and say that it's too little. But do bear in mind that it's above where the average England rate is, even though there's this complex variability\u00a0within the English\u00a0rate that has caused some confusion there, which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed. If we find, as we pilot it, or if we find because\u00a0there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in, there needs to be adjustment, then we'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case.\nDarren Millar AM: But that won't put the project at risk in terms of its finances?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, no. We are still very confident, looking forward, on the best projections we have, fed by the live input that's coming in from the pilot, which will be fed again in the autumn\u2014the Arad\u00a0report coming forward\u2014that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this\u2014challenging as this is, we have the capacity to deliver it\u2014but also that the funding that's available, on our best estimate\u2014the estimate we've stood by, that broad ball park of that \u00a3100 million figure\u2014it's deliverable within that. But if it changes, we will come back. And if it changes, I'll have to be sitting down with my boss, Vaughan Gething, and with Mark Drakeford, to argue the case on it. But at this moment, we have confidence and we've run the rule across\u00a0this repeatedly. But that rate, combined with the other elements of this childcare offer\u2014there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out.\nLynne Neagle AM: Mark on this.\nMark Reckless AM: Minister, as a parent who's been researching childcare options, it's obvious to me that in Cardiff, and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire, costs are substantially higher than this, and I haven't\u00a0been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for \u00a327, which is implied by your rate. Isn't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you're going to need a higher rate to make it work? Isn't that already obvious? Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Chair, my biggest fear is a parent who's actually involved in this area already, but, having been one myself\u2014. Mark, you may be right, that's exactly why we're piloting it and that's why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport, we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability\u00a0and the \u00a34.50 per hour rate.\nMark Reckless AM: But you're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I've referred to.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No. We will be. We are going to be.\nMark Reckless AM: When are you starting?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Cardiff and Newport\u2014September.\nOwain Lloyd: This September.\nMark Reckless AM: This September?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes. So, we're not missing any of these learning\u00a0experiences and we know that\u2014. The reason we've gone for the other areas first, by the way\u2014please take this back to any authorities affected\u2014is simply because we've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales, areas in north Wales, areas around Welsh language provision, areas in deep valleys, understanding\u00a0the cultural and the economic impacts. So, we've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision. But it's coming, it's imminent, and we'll learn the lessons from it. And do you know, you may be right? And if you are right, that it's more expensive, and we need a higher rate within\u00a0those areas, then we're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee. But let's go in and learn it first of all, rather than assume it necessarily.\nLynne Neagle AM: Just before I bring David in on the issue that Hefin raised about the chargeable\u00a0items, your paper says that providers can charge up to \u00a37.50 a day for food, snacks, transport and consumables such as nappies. Now, that's \u00a337.50 a week, which is a lot of money for parents, and I just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure?\u00a0But also, do you think there's a risk\u00a0that providers who maybe aren't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think they're the right areas to flag up, and if I thought that was going to happen I'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme. I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that\u2014whether or not, within the pilot areas that we are already in, which are quite diverse, that is happening. We're only one term into learning the lessons, by the way, but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families. So, the early evaluation, I think, will give us good feedback on that. I think also, by the way, that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here. It's not in their interests, I have to say, as the umbrella bodies or individual providers, to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families. This is about providing opportunities for all working families. But especially, I have to say, the early evaluation that we've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts\u2014in the early evaluation\u2014are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales. That's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it, and we don't want them then being priced out because of add-ons. So, there has to be some pragmatism, I have to say, and some open partnership working here with the sector, and we do have that.\nLynne Neagle AM: John on this.\nJohn Griffiths AM: I want to come back to the \u00a34.50 rate, but in terms of working with the sector, briefly, if I might, Chair, I just wonder, Huw, in terms of that \u00a34.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales, to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity? Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability, around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well. This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says, 'Here we've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it', because we recognise that there's great diversity in provision out there, and we also recognise that things will change over time. It's not only the geographical diversity\u2014it's the diversity of the sector itself. I think we need to, as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out, continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have. Just to flag up one issue, it's right that we're focusing on those elements that aren't included within it, to some extent as well, and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families, but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well. Let me give you a clear illustration: some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well, it would add something like in the region of 50p to that \u00a34.50 rate. That would have, at this moment, impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it. I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now, okay? But, it's that open dialogue with the sector that says, 'There's one thing about what you're saying you demand as a market; there's another thing about what we're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers' money to actually put into this'. They also understand, John, that as well as an enabling policy\u2014and we're seeing the evidence, by the way; I can cite it\u2014of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work, increase their hours and so on, this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of Wales. The stuff that's being debated ad nauseam here within the Assembly about foundational sectors\u2014. The sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity, including, by the way, not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations, such as exist in Neath and elsewhere that I was involved\u00a0in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up\u2014that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well. They know that. They know there is job creation within this and there's economic impact for that. So, it's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely, 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we've come up with \u00a34.50.'\nLynne Neagle AM: David, you had a question on the pilots.\nDavid Rees AM: Yes, just to finish that section off, if I may, Chair. Before I go to my question, I want to come back to Mark Reckless's question and the answer you gave. I got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas, you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate. Is that also on the cards?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: David, it's possible. I think our preference would be, I have to say, to stick with the universal rate, because we know it's\u2014. There's real simplicity and it's been welcomed in the sector. But the sector, also, are quite pragmatic about this. One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision. If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas, then we'll have to look at that, but there might be other ways of splicing it. But first of all, I think we have to go in and see how does this work. We might find, Mark, we might find, David, that we go in and when everything is tallied up, the \u00a34.50 per hour works in supporting provision there.\nDavid Rees AM: Okay. In your answer to John, you talked about affordability, which I totally understand. If I can now remind you: I don't remember the word 'affordability' coming in the manifesto pledge of the Government. It was 'we will offer childcare facilities'. So, I just want to put a reminder to you there.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Ministers always look at affordability.\nDavid Rees AM: Well, voters don't. In the situation regarding Welsh-medium, you answered that a little bit earlier, but I have concerns about capacity. Workforce capacity you've mentioned. To actually be registered you need staff who are qualified. There's clearly a need to get more staff, because in your own paper you say that the report in 2016 said you do not have the childcare capacity in Wales at the moment. Do you believe that you can actually deliver the workforce to meet that capacity, first of all through the English medium, but secondly through the Welsh medium as well? Because there's a clear need to look at it. You talk about 30 by 2020. By the way, 30 is nothing big when you consider the whole of Wales. Do you actually think you've got that workforce capacity set up before this is fully rolled out?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I hope, Chair, you'll appreciate that in our submission to you we've been very open. This is challenging. This is. To get to where we want to go is a huge challenge. Can we do it? Yes we can. And I don't say that glibly. Let me suggest some of the ways why. We have confidence that we can do this if everybody is working together across the sector, across the local authorities. Let me talk broadly about capacity, first of all, including English and Welsh-medium provision for children with complex needs, provision for children with disabilities\u2014all of this. First of all, this is being\u2014. The work that we're doing to increase both capacity in terms of trained staff and qualified staff: we have the 10-year plan that I mentioned, which has already been announced. We're working through it. We're working through it with the sector. So, we're identifying not only broadly at a national level where we need to develop those qualifications, but also at a regional, geographic level as well, and that's being taken forward. We've engaged with the 22 authorities\u2014not just the pilot areas as well on this. So, beyond the pilot areas, we also have intense engagement. As you can see from what I've said before, it's rolling out progressively, but with all 22 authorities we're working with them on their childcare sufficiency assessments to identify where their shortages are.\nDavid Rees AM: What have the pilot programmes actually shown you about this, and how are you going to move this forward?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, it's precisely that. So, within the pilot areas, we have a greater depth of analysis now of where both the workforce and the physical provisions are. Whether those are maintained or non-maintained or third sector or school facilities or whatever, we've got a much deeper granulation of identifying where that is, and we're working, then, with those authorities, with the capital moneys that we've allocated to this and the workforce development, and with local colleges, to develop the workforce and the physical constraints. But we're also doing that with the other 22, with all the 22 authorities as well, in anticipation of the wider roll-out. They're not being left out of this. And by the way, it's not only the Cardiffs and the Newports; it's all the other ones where there isn't full roll-out. We're engaged with them deeply at the moment with that analysis on their childcare sufficiency assessments, both in terms of workforce, but also physical provision. So, we're doing that already. We are looking as well, as this is rolled out, around the issue of co-location. Now, co-location is a fruitful way to look at future development. It doesn't mean, by the way, that we exclude the third sector or social enterprise approach, or the independent sector, but co-location could be key to the roll-out of this in the right areas where it can be done, because then we avoid any\u00a0fracture between the education hours and the childcare hours: the physical transportation of children from one location to another. So, we're engaged with the 22 authorities on that: where could that be developed, who would be the providers that would do it and do they have the workforce to scale up to do it? If not, how do they talk to local colleges to do that? So, we're doing that at the moment. I mentioned we've put the \u00a31 million additional funding into the meithrin over the next two years, targeting\u00a040 new Welsh-medium groups by 2021, which pretty much coincides with the full roll-out of this. It's part of the aim of an additional 150 over the next decade of meithrin. So, all of those things, David, give us a confidence that we're going to be in the right place.\nDavid Rees AM: But in particular, take the Welsh language\u2014I understand Gwynedd, and I won't ask another question on that for obvious reasons at this point in time\u2014but in some of the other areas where you've piloted, you've gone partial in some areas. When there's Welsh language education, and the three to five-year-olds go to schools, they go from all areas of the council, basically. They don't actually go necessarily from the local area, and therefore you're getting a different picture. Have you been able to assess the actual impact, properly, upon the Welsh-medium side of things? Because, for example, my grandchildren will go from my area, which may not be in one of the considerations, to a school that may be in that consideration, and that happens regularly.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely. We know that historically we've got, across the country, a shortage of Welsh-language childcare provision\u2014meithrin and so on\u2014but we have not only a strategy in place, but the fact that we've got local authorities now doing their own assessments within their area, across the piste of childcare, but also in terms of Welsh language, that means then that we can start filling those gaps with the money we've put to it, and that includes in all parts of Wales, including those areas within south Wales and others that are less deep in their tradition of speaking Welsh over recent history, anyway, but where the demand for it is massive. So, local authorities are tasked with doing their own assessments of childcare sufficiency for this childcare offer. They're identifying the gaps, David, and we will work with them and with providers to fill those gaps, and that includes with the umbrella organisations for Welsh language childcare provision.\nDavid Rees AM: And that's the same for those children with physical disabilities or learning disabilities.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely the same. Absolutely the same. And this does mean, Chair, that it will be different, as it currently is in different areas: the type of provision, where the provision is located. But the provision should be there. This offer won't happen unless the provision is there for those children with complex needs, children with disabilities, Welsh language provision, as well as more generic provision as well, but it will be diverse in its provision around areas.\nLynne Neagle AM: I do want to move on now, John, so if I can come back to your question. Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: I would like to pick up on the last point, if I may.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. The investment in meithrin, of course, is one that we all welcome. A question from me though, the wider question, is: how do we mainstream Welsh medium into childcare? Because, clearly, leaving it to meithrin is one way of doing it, but there's a lot of existing infrastructure out there that we need to upskill in terms of the provision of Welsh medium. So, it's not a question as such, but I'm sure you recognise that\u2014that there is a challenge there. Because if we are to get to where we want to get to, it isn't about growing meithrin, or Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin; it's about mainstreaming Welsh-medium provision within the wider sector. So, it wasn't a question after all. So, looking at the manifesto commitment that was made in 2016, clearly the main or the principal aim of this policy is around removing some of the barriers to secure employment for parents, albeit with very positive outcomes for the children themselves, and we don't ignore or neglect that at any cost. But I'm just wondering: how would you then reconcile that with the findings of the Public Policy Institute for Wales report, which I mentioned to you yesterday, which was commissioned by the Government to look at policy options in this context, which concluded that there will be no 'substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children' and that 'the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers in families with a child of target age is extremely small'?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, the first thing I would say is that what we're learning from the pilots is that it is having real-life impacts on parents, including in disadvantaged families, and we're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground, where parents are making different choices in the areas where it's being piloted. So, the types of different choices they're making could be to expand the number of hours that they're in work, because they now have a choice, they're not constrained to certain hours or whatever, they have a wider choice, with a wider number of providers, and they're making that decision and they're able to expand their hours. Some, by the way, Llyr,\u00a0I have to say\u2014and, again, these are real-life situations\u2014are saying, 'What we're doing is not expanding our hours, but, because of the increased provision of childcare and the increased offer, we are now able to actually spend more time with our children, because we're adjusting our hours of work, based on the childcare provision offer.'\u00a0That in itself, I have to say, is a worthy aim. But I would say what we found out, in real-life examples\u2014I'm not saying that in direct contrast to what that paper was saying\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: That's what I was going to ask; it sounds as if you're saying they were wrong.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: But what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out, where we are learning, live time, and I think the Arad report in October\u2014we're hoping to see the final report in October\u2014will help put some flesh on this as well. It is already having an effect: the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage, they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand, take more hours, adjust their own lifestyles around it or more. So, it's having a positive effect. I can cite to you examples, because I've asked my own officials on this, of families who tell us they're saving up to \u00a3250 a week on the basis of this offer within the pilot areas, who've increased their hours of employment, who've changed their working patterns to suit their work life, but also to suit their families. Now, that's real stuff, as opposed to\u2014yes.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, in effect, you are saying that the PPIW\u00a0report got it wrong, basically.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, I'm not saying that they got it wrong and it's wholly wrong, but it is interesting, within that report, that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this. It's not only the childcare; it is the transport, it's the training and education, it's the employment support and all of those. And we agree with that, but we do think, and what we're seeing, live time, at the moment\u2014maybe at some point, somebody else will produce a report beyond the Arad\u00a0report in October that will say, 'Well, actually, the way this is designed, that they've done it in Wales, is having a material effect on those families, particularly the most disadvantaged families.'\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: But you're asking us to support a Bill here, albeit a framework Bill, to achieve a policy aim where you're giving us anecdotal evidence that it's having an impact, contrary to research that's previously been done, albeit with promises that, maybe, an evaluation sometime in the autumn might tell us a different story.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We know, and we are constantly told\u2014I'm sure this is commonplace in constituency surgeries, as well\u2014by parents who say that the biggest mitigating factor for them, actually, either going into work at an earlier opportunity or expanding their hours is purely the cost of childcare in front of them. We are picking up, even from the early term of the analysis\u2014. I think our further reports, both Arad and as we go forward with the pilots, will substantiate this more. It'll go beyond the anecdotal, it will show that parents are having an enhanced opportunity to balance their work life, to make better choices, either in terms of expanding the number of hours they're working and increasing their disposable income within their families, or actually making it simply better for them in their family situation, where they don't currently have that offer. So, I get the fact that we have one report out there, but it's one report. It's a report, and we're not dismissing it entirely, but what we are saying is: we are now working with real-life piloting of an offer, and we are seeing the benefits coming through. As we roll this out, we'll be back in front of this committee saying, 'Well, this is now what we're finding. We can go beyond the real-life stories that I'm relating to you now, and we can say, \"Well, here's some hard data that goes with this, as well.\"'\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. You reference in your paper, as well, another report, which is the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0report, 'Starting Strong 2017', and it highlights countries that have, maybe, the most similar childcare offer to what's being proposed here in Wales. I'm just wondering what assessment you've made of those similarities, because, clearly, there'll be different economic contexts in different countries and different levels of public expenditure, et cetera.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We haven't done really detailed analysis of comparisons with other countries far from Wales, but we will be doing work\u00a0that will be doing some benchmarking against, where we can find similar models, where appropriate\u2014do some appropriate benchmarking. What we have been doing is looking at what's been happening across the border in England and trying to learn from the lessons there, and also the offer in Scotland as well, which are both close to hand. They're in quite similar contexts. But we will do some work, Llyr, around benchmarking against good comparative international examples, where appropriate.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, there we are, because one of my concerns was that the focus in a number of the countries in the OECD report are for nought to three-year-olds, whereas, of course, the policy focus here is for a slightly older age group.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, and I fully get that, but again, and I know it can be said, 'Well, this is an example' but it's real-life examples. We are having people who are telling us that they're now making the choice to go to work earlier because\u00a0this is extended to three-year-olds, but they would have delayed. There is a direct outcome\u00a0there if this childcare offer enables somebody to say, 'Well, I'm going to go a year earlier back into work and bring income into the family.'\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. So, moving on, then, to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness, of course, which is an important one to address. Clearly, one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children, hopefully, later on in life. I want to come back to this point that the Children's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised: the concern that, actually, the most disadvantaged\u2014those from workless households\u2014are being excluded from this policy. Isn't there therefore a risk that they'll be left even further behind?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I've had long, detailed and positive discussions with the children's commissioner on this, and I know the children's commissioner would want a more universal offer, but I make two points on that: one is, that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was, and it's not the offer that's being taken forward now. It is a different thing, a universal offer, and there\u00a0are issues around that with complexity, and also affordability. But it isn't the offer that we took forward into Government; this is what we're taking forward. But it is interesting\u00a0in terms of that aspect of families then who lose out. I'd say two significant things on it: one is, this doesn't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare. Within this, there are 10 hours of the foundation years, educational input, which is there for everybody. But before that, particularly for those disadvantaged families, before we even get to that stage, you have schemes such as Flying Start, and I know this committee has looked in detail at Flying Start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere. If I had all the money under the sun, I would really do that, Chair; I would really do it. But I don't have all the money under the sun.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: But you do have the ability to target the money.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but the fact that Flying Start, we know, is leading to those outcomes where those children, in quite challenged circumstances very often, are more ready to step up to the foundation year, are more ready, then, to step through into mainstream education in later years\u2014those things tie together. So, there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family, by the way, within this offer, let alone the childcare. That doesn't mean that everybody's excluded, but it does mean, yes, that this offer is focused on working parents. And we don't think that that's a bad thing. In fact, it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election, which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags, which is, 'I can't afford to go back to work because I can't afford the childcare. Don't tell me to go back to work, I can't afford it.'\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The majority of disadvantaged children don't live in Flying Start areas, do they?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, indeed.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, there's a missing cohort there that can't access one or the other, and the school readiness gap is growing, and, really, are we focusing our resources in the right place here?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, yes, in terms of this scheme, but it doesn't sit alone as this scheme\u2014it's the wider plethora of, I have to say, progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different\u00a0forms. It's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents, and readiness not only for the parents and for their children, but also the support into work. So, if, for example, you look at the Parents, Childcare and Employment programme, which is separate from this, there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families. If you look at the support for the children, we've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education, but we've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation, education and so on and so forth. If you look at this solely on its own and say, 'Well, there is nothing else there;\u00a0the rest of Wales is a desert and there's no support for parents, for getting parents back into work or for\u00a0those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education',\u00a0I'd be worried. But, actually, this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in Wales, where I think we are well ahead of the other nations. Yes, we could do more, and I always say, Llyr; I always say, Chair, that if I had\u2014I don't have a chequebook at all, because it's not in my gift\u2014if I had a blank cheque I'd do a lot more, but we don't. But what we can do is get the right schemes in place, and if this helps drive more choices for working parents, including, by the way\u2014.\u00a0There are niceties within this as well; it doesn't have to be that both parents are working. You could have a parent who is on incapacity benefit. You could have a parent who is a registered carer. They would qualify for the scheme. Those will be some of those most disadvantaged families that we both have those concerns about. So, there is some flexibility within this scheme as well to deal with some of those disadvantaged families.\nLynne Neagle AM: Darren on this.\nDarren Millar AM: I am surprised by the answer there,\u00a0particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations, when they're 16 years old. Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development, which could, of course, lead to a perverse outcome later on in life, but I don't want to ask you about that. If I can just very quickly ask you: has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they're in 16 hours or more of education each week? So, they may not be entering the labour market, but, of course, one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education, so what arrangements are in place there?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Darren, we have considered it, and we haven't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work, not into training to enable them to get into work. There are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth, but it's not this scheme.\nDarren Millar AM: But it's not prescribed support, is it? You know, it's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier. You must have done some costings, then, if you've considered it, and you must have tried to identify numbers.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I'm looking to my left and my right.\nOwain Lloyd: Not at this point.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We haven't\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: So, you haven't considered it that much, have you?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We have actually considered\u2014. We consider it from the point of, 'What is this scheme set up to do?' It's very clear. When we ran, in the manifesto on this point\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: I understand that. I don't want you to repeat yourself because I know we are against the clock. But, very specifically, when you say you've considered it, what you mean is you thought about it but you've not costed it, you've not identified the numbers that might be involved\u2014\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely, absolutely.\nDarren Millar AM: And therefore you've not considered whether it might be affordable in addition to the policy objective that this is trying to meet.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No, Darren, you're right: we haven't considered affordability because we've considered it on first principles to do with what this offer is trying to do. It doesn't fit within the offer so, as such, why would we do the costings?\nDarren Millar AM: Perhaps I can frame my question in another way. Are you prepared to consider it if you're able to identify the numbers and potential cost?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Ah, right, okay.\u00a0We'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee, but it doesn't actually fit within the first principles of what the\u00a0scheme is designed to do. Darren, can I just pick up on your point, in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr?\u00a0I drew attention in my answer to Llyr\u00a0to schemes such as the PaCE scheme.\u00a0In Gwynedd,\u00a0one of our pilot areas, they\u00a0are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer. So, what they are doing is wrapping the support around. It is not the case, as you've suggested then, that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families. What this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision, and that's\u00a0the way we want to see it work. So, I wouldn't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families. Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works, and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme.\u00a0All families will qualify for the 10 hours\u00a0of education. In Gwynedd, they're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: But on the other hand, Minister, you've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it, and yet not all kids will be able to access it, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: But all children can access the 10 hours, and they can access Flying Start\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours, is it not?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: If they're in a Flying Start area.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: \u2014or they can be in a children's zone area or they can\u2014\nDarren Millar AM: If they're in those areas.\nLynne Neagle AM: Right, I've got John and then David, and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief, please.\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes, certainly, Chair. In terms of child development and how this fits with wider\u00a0Welsh Government strategy, Huw,\u00a0I'd be interested in what you'd have to say about the quality of childcare.\u00a0We're talking a lot about quantity, but obviously we want to up quality, and that's recognised by Welsh Government. They've talked about increasing the qualifications within the workforce, and the quality. I just wonder how that sits within the \u00a34.50, because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there, and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: John, you're absolutely right, and two things on that: I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward\u2014a very good independent sector-run childcare provision, with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other, and I asked the point about the integration, curiously, but\u00a0what they were doing was\u2014. Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we'd want to see: not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects\u2014. So, it was hard to differentiate, in some ways, what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding, and including the nutritional stuff and all of that. Now, that is the model we need to see, and the \u00a34.50 seems to work, at the moment, for that. It'll be interesting, as we discussed previously, as it goes forward\u2014. We need to look at whether that works, going forward. But the quality, I think, is key, and that's why we're focused very much on registered inspected providers, as opposed to every Tom, Dick and Harriet.\nJohn Griffiths AM: If we want to increase salary levels, though, which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality, then obviously that might impact on the \u00a34.50 rate.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, indeed, and we are cognisant\u2014. It's interesting that we focus on whether the \u00a34.50 is affordable, but the \u00a34.50\u2014you know, we're having an interesting discussion internally about how that \u00a34.50 offer per hour sits alongside others, such as the foundation phase offer, and it's more generous. So, I think it's: how do we align, as time goes by, the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff? Now, we're doing some fascinating work that I think I've referred to on this committee before about aligning the early years development entirely. Now, this is an evolving piece of work, but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that. How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development? It's not simply childcare.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Right. The next questions are from Mark.\nMark Reckless AM: In terms of child development and not accentuating disadvantage, another area where this may apply is the kids who are born in the summer term, compared to those who are born in Michaelmas. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they start with a disadvantage at school and often don't make that up, even as they go through school. What is the rationale for providing the older children with five terms of this, compared to three terms for the younger children who already have the relative disadvantage?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I'm looking to my colleagues here and\u2014\nJo-Anne Daniels: Well, the criteria for eligibility for the offer are the term after the child's third birthday, which is equivalent to the eligibility criteria for the foundation phase early education offer. Clearly, then, the number of terms that a child is able to, or parents are able to, access the childcare offer will be influenced by when the child is born,\u00a0but I think you may be referring to a sort of parallel question, which is about whether\u2014. There have been questions raised about whether children who are summer-born should, in fact, start school in the term after they turn four, or whether actually they should be allowed the flexibility to start school at a later age, which I know is something that has been tested in England, and there is some mixed evidence about school starting age and the birth month of children.\nMark Reckless AM: Well, they do have flexibility. You don't have to start your kids until the term following when they're five. That's the compulsory school\u2014\nJo-Anne Daniels: Well, that's the legal position, but, obviously, in practice, most children will start school in the term after they're four.\nMark Reckless AM: So, given the disadvantage we know that the younger children born in the summer have, relative to the older ones, why accentuate that by giving the older kids five terms of this project, which you tell us will have such positive effects on their child development, but the summer kids only get three? Doesn't\u00a0that make the situation worse?\nJo-Anne Daniels: I'm not 100 per cent sure I understand the question. So, children will stop being in receipt\u00a0of the childcare offer once they become eligible for a full-time school place, and most children will become eligible for a full-time school place in the term after their fourth birthday.\nMark Reckless AM: But the older kids become eligible for this five terms before they start school, where the younger kids, who're already disadvantaged, become eligible for it only three terms before, accentuating the problem, surely. Could more thought be given to this issue?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: We'll take that away. It's confused us a little bit, but we'll take that away. We might need to come back to you and\u2014. Yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: If you could write to us about that, that would be helpful.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you. Minister, you got, or Welsh Government, really, got the Public Policy Institute for Wales to study this proposed policy and they concluded that it would have no substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children, and that the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what\u00a0I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income\u2014as I mentioned earlier, up to \u00a3250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples\u2014but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.\nLynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.\nMark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost \u00a361 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost \u00a3144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks\u2014beyond the term time and so on\u2014carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.\nMark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of \u00a326,000 in Wales\u2014 it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government\u00a0offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England\u2014the tax offer is more integrated\u2014has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every\u2014\nMark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project\u2014people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right\u2014sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.\nMark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria\u2014you have a \u00a3100,000 cap, as well as the \u00a36,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC\u2014will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the \u00a37.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.\nOwain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.\nMark Reckless AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to\u2014well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you\u2014diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Uh fourth meeting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We have to do what ?\nProject Manager: Some extra deciding .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} W what ? Alri alright . We'll see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: And the video button . The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .\nProject Manager: Well if I look at it , the side the side view {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , at the back {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then you can add suggestions .\nProject Manager: Oh yeah alright . Yeah {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I I don't want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ?\nUser Interface: No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the back . Yeah . {vocalsound} We thought about {disfmarker} Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . {vocalsound} And we thought about the logo big in the middle .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe that's too much\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way .\nUser Interface: No I don't think {disfmarker} And the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: That's basically what we were thinking about ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: W\nUser Interface: And about the side view um {disfmarker} This the front won't be as thick ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I see , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course ,\nProject Manager: Well . Yeah I see it .\nIndustrial Designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .\nUser Interface: Well , it won't be visible . Mm ?\nProject Manager: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Why ? {vocalsound} Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mean uh the the the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: {gap} If y {vocalsound} If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} In the middle in the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: You you have it a bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .\nProject Manager: And how large is it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , that's the question .\nIndustrial Designer: That's the question .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well {disfmarker} Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? {gap} This was Mike's prototype ,\nProject Manager: Well uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it .\nProject Manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: But now you have a totally different {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well , they lay there all the time .\nIndustrial Designer: The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They the the the the the side view ,\nIndustrial Designer: Side ? Uh oh the side ?\nProject Manager: we didn't uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we we he drew the s the side ,\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But you you hold it like this .\nUser Interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it ,\nIndustrial Designer: You're not holding it like this or something .\nUser Interface: you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this .\nProject Manager: No no no .\nIndustrial Designer: You have it more like this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way .\nMarketing: Like you're holding your telephone .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .\nUser Interface: Hmm . That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree on this .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No but but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree\nProject Manager: Yeah well\nUser Interface: and only Nils {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .\nUser Interface: But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . So uh I c I c\nIndustrial Designer: If necessary .\nProject Manager: Well , we'll we we'll do it like this .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable .\nProject Manager: No {disfmarker} No ,\nIndustrial Designer: But do you\nProject Manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} In the market uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think .\nProject Manager: No not totally .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Not totally , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh {vocalsound} every everyone into account . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: And you might be uh {disfmarker} You might be target customer .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't know .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we don't know ,\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe a thousand people ,\nProject Manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research .\nIndustrial Designer: or a million people .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Let it be .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . So that's that .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh any other suggestions ?\nProject Manager: No , I think it's great .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But what about the redesigning ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Comes to that later .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um you . Uh c You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Walter . {vocalsound} You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You're very personal again .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Great .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's more useful than just {vocalsound} speaking .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , this is just a short intro .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this .\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I know , but {vocalsound} I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire .\nProject Manager: To the customers ?\nIndustrial Designer: So and we ha we have answer now ?\nProject Manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , but I can't can s\nProject Manager: Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: But um {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but uh , you know {disfmarker} We dis we di {vocalsound} we designed it to be perfect .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we {vocalsound} we know where we stand .\nProject Manager: Well , one .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten .\nProject Manager: Well so it's point four . Easy to find t\nIndustrial Designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right , so {disfmarker} Right . Uh is it good-looking ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well , I guess uh I think uh {vocalsound} it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . {gap}\nProject Manager: Two . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um {vocalsound} uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: The titanium might be uh f for older people .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It you put uh put a black front on it or something .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh no . {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also {disfmarker} Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and not only for youth uh young people .\nUser Interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . I totally agree .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , the fourteen yeah .\nProject Manager: We we have to get get on , go through this .\nMarketing: Right , a number please .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so .\nMarketing: So the last one is seven .\nUser Interface: Um , no it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Easy to change channels ?\nProject Manager: No , not false . It's one .\nMarketing: Oh , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nProject Manager: Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it {gap} .\nMarketing: Change channels ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: So I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . You {disfmarker} How can you make it any easier ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} With two huge buttons .\nMarketing: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , huge is a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nMarketing: Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?\nProject Manager: Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s\nUser Interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well six then . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: because of the colour . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Six ? Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so ,\nProject Manager: Are the functions easy to learn ?\nIndustrial Designer: but um um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} We have so few functions , so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nUser Interface: Well , I should {disfmarker} I think two ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: because {vocalsound} the voice recorder is n not self learning . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Alright . Two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , but just do some {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} We we {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I th I th I think this is too time consuming .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we take too much time ?\nProject Manager: Uh not not towards you ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: but towards this all .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Th this is {gap} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: We you have to put it to the customers .\nMarketing: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? {vocalsound} R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nProject Manager: Uh well well a bit , so four .\nMarketing: Four . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , very much . One .\nProject Manager: One . And features included also one . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Device fancy feeling .\nIndustrial Designer: And I think fancy-feeling too ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , cool man .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the titanium back . Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's great .\nProject Manager: Is the device easy to use ?\nUser Interface: The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes we have {vocalsound} not many buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: So well maybe two\nProject Manager: Two , three .\nUser Interface: Two {vocalsound} two .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the voice recorder .\nMarketing: Well , with the uh {disfmarker} Three .\nProject Manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?\nUser Interface: T\nIndustrial Designer: F\nProject Manager: Well in our covers , in our fronts .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So yes , one .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . One or two . Yeah .\nUser Interface: One or two , another two .\nMarketing: Nah f four I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Four ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} If you look at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Oh okay . Okay {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well three .\nMarketing: Three , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can also have {gap} front with uh with fruit on it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , that's true .\nProject Manager: Is the material attractive ?\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: This is the last meeting ?\nProject Manager: Yes , but we we have to design much more ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: The average will uh come later .\nProject Manager: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly .\nProject Manager: Oh . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point .\nIndustrial Designer: My god .\nProject Manager: I had to fit it in .\nMarketing: It has to go to twelve , right ?\nProject Manager: I twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four .\nIndustrial Designer: The what ?\nProject Manager: The sample speaker ,\nIndustrial Designer: The {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Out .\nProject Manager: the s sensor .\nMarketing: That's easy . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: Kick it out .\nUser Interface: The what ?\nProject Manager: We have to go to twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Yeah . The speaker .\nProject Manager: The speaker costs far , by far the most .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option .\nMarketing: That's some wrong info , man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It it isn't worth it .\nIndustrial Designer: No . No , d th No .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: We could make two different versions , one with and one without .\nMarketing: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But for this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's just extra . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: So , zero .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we go to fourteen point six .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually .\nMarketing: What more ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Batteries are uh quite {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh no , no no no .\nProject Manager: w a remote control has a battery .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think .\nUser Interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nMarketing: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Can't we do that with a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: Why not ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh that uh y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: because my information says it .\nProject Manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yeah . Regular is normal .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And simple ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Simple .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nothing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Elementary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Your part .\nIndustrial Designer: I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report .\nProject Manager: What happens if we do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Single {disfmarker} Well you have to use a chip . So {disfmarker} Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: How much do we win ? One .\nUser Interface: We we we {disfmarker} Why ?\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: We have very little options furthermore , for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface: Uh well we have to put that in .\nMarketing: Yeah , we need to have the {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: That that's a fact . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there ,\nMarketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but it's only one half .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Nah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it d it doesn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , that's n It's not relevant .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah , you must change the chip uh back .\nProject Manager: then you s then you only have one half left .\nUser Interface: You must change the chip back , Nils .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nMarketing: No , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Then the whole concept is uh\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} we oh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} You can make you can make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: You have to use it .\nMarketing: But if you don't sell\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? No , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Y we don't need both .\nProject Manager: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Says {gap} .\nProject Manager: Says , his {disfmarker} Uh that was in the second meeting , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I I did single curve to {disfmarker} Well you said s double curved ,\nUser Interface: I ?\nProject Manager: uh he ,\nUser Interface: {gap} ?\nProject Manager: because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We can also make it flat .\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} No\nIndustrial Designer: But what what did what do n\nMarketing: no no no .\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What do they mean with the curves ?\nProject Manager: Curved ?\nIndustrial Designer: Is th Is this a curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes , that's curved .\nIndustrial Designer: One curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .\nProject Manager: No , it's one curve .\nIndustrial Designer: It's how you {disfmarker} It's how you look at it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} One curve . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: One curve , simple .\nIndustrial Designer: Well then we have a huge problem I think .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: We have a big financial problem .\nUser Interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy .\nProject Manager: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But {disfmarker} Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah or we could replace it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you if you make it cool to have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: By the way , we also have this one .\nMarketing: Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: Oh , costs nothing . That's nice . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .\nProject Manager: Plastic is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes , but I just got it .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well that's pretty uh l\nUser Interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium ,\nMarketing: That is pretty stupid . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: N not very practical . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: uh titanium-coloured plastic ?\nProject Manager: Who ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You want to dump the titanium ?\nUser Interface: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper .\nProject Manager: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But I'm n I don't agree .\nUser Interface: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again .\nIndustrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .\nUser Interface: Ah no no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same .\nProject Manager: No , I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Well , I do think so .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Y\nProject Manager: Yes . And the feel ,\nUser Interface: {gap} feel .\nProject Manager: and th that it is strong , and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people .\nProject Manager: We still {vocalsound} we had to focus to get more people from the younger group ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but not lose the one {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think the titanium is very important .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then .\nUser Interface: We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think .\nMarketing: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Well what else ?\nUser Interface: No , nothing .\nIndustrial Designer: W I mean uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or you shou {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Amen .\nMarketing: Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Because you have lots of functions {vocalsound} in it too .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well yeah . Alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Why can't I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I agree with that . So we u we use uh {disfmarker} Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic .\nProject Manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back .\nProject Manager: I I'll talk to the managers . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No no no no . W Titanium stays there .\nProject Manager: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah this is good ,\nMarketing: Osl {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but it it's not good enough . {vocalsound} So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .\nProject Manager: Ah those {gap} those account managers , what do th d what do they know ?\nUser Interface: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Come on . Riot . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: What do we {disfmarker} Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes , yes .\nUser Interface: No because we did not know anything about it .\nProject Manager: One and a half Euros . Hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah al alright , yeah .\nMarketing: If you don't have the money , you can't make it .\nIndustrial Designer: But we have to deal with it now . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive .\nProject Manager: So ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So we have to make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: Titanium gone and add plastic .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but then we've got money left .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?\nProject Manager: Well , no it's just uh all plastic .\nIndustrial Designer: No {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well alright . Huh .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh six . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's just free , man .\nIndustrial Designer: A lot of plastic , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Four . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: No two for the to make it clear .\nProject Manager: But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And we still have money left .\nUser Interface: Yeah . W\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do we want , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: I want gold plating .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No no um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah right . I want chrome . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I think uh the case is double curved then .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Because you y have that curve\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have we have to uh fill {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and you have that curve .\nProject Manager: Y Oh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well , th that that is the problem .\nUser Interface: Yeah well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we ha {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: No no no , but th that's not f um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Safe .\nUser Interface: Well y we have curves in all directions .\nIndustrial Designer: Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped ,\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} alright .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so it it can be done . {vocalsound} But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven .\nProject Manager: Finance ?\nUser Interface: I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it .\nProject Manager: Well , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Guys ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We have to dump our titanium ,\nMarketing: Shoot .\nProject Manager: and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Objection .\nUser Interface: Pro project . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project . {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I think it's uh {disfmarker} Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , me too .\nProject Manager: That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason ,\nIndustrial Designer: Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: And uh unrealistic .\nProject Manager: but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .\nUser Interface: Well we we we used our creativity ,\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: but we just had to adapt it to the costs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Which isn't very practical ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nei . Uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but {vocalsound} that's the way .\nProject Manager: Well , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh leadership next .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Terrible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh teamwork ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leadership .\nUser Interface: Leadership ? Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It was very democratic . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh yeah well {vocalsound} I think so also .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But o alright , the teamwork ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess .\nProject Manager: No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Right yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah , think so too .\nProject Manager: Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It was a complete disaster .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} Uh it it it uh it is uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen .\nProject Manager: It's also a It's both the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Or not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard .\nProject Manager: I liked this SMARTboard ,\nIndustrial Designer: That's the digital panel .\nProject Manager: but I hated that one .\nMarketing: This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ?\nProject Manager: Well it's both a SMARTboard .\nIndustrial Designer: That's that's the smart\nMarketing: Yeah right . B but you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh they're both SMARTboards . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: This is just a large t large television .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A televi Yeah .\nMarketing: You u you use the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .\nMarketing: Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , wi w which one did you like ?\nUser Interface: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Left or right ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That one isn't accurate . {vocalsound} It just doesn't work .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .\nMarketing: You can {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes . Th that is so .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I didn't use uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the {vocalsound} these th\nProject Manager: We're now talking about the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't need a SMARTboard .\nUser Interface: {gap} Well we we used that one ,\nIndustrial Designer: Nei It it's much m {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we needed it . I think .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an {disfmarker} I I like it .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay , alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh you can uh {disfmarker} I I sent it about three times now . Uh {vocalsound} a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah , it is .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The simple uh sch school board .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I agree .\nProject Manager: And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ?\nIndustrial Designer: I I didn't use it .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop .\nProject Manager: I used it uh just to check it out , but uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself ,\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} It isn't practical . Right .\nProject Manager: and then you're going to send it , yeah . Well , no .\nIndustrial Designer: W {vocalsound} But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block .\nMarketing: Your notepad . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's , no , it it's useless .\nUser Interface: Well I I drew this . {gap} Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah alright . For drawings ,\nProject Manager: For drawings , yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: but not for personal notes . I think that's not very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} N notes mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I mean {vocalsound} you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: If you've {disfmarker} If you've {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict {disfmarker} Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I understand .\nMarketing: That Stefan use .\nIndustrial Designer: But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . {vocalsound} You can't {disfmarker} It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . It's it's only useful if you have to draw something .\nUser Interface: Yeah . But then uh it's really useful , I think .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep . Alright . Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mu Yeah right .\nProject Manager: Of course great .\nMarketing: Yeah , great . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Can we keep them ? Uh .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: B by my {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wireless uh wireless things .\nUser Interface: Thanks Project Manager . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Other uh things we used here ? I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well these chairs , man . {vocalsound} Really great .\nIndustrial Designer: Well did you really uh {disfmarker} Did you really take uh take those in account ? {vocalsound} I {vocalsound} half of time I didn't notice they were there . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No . I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . {vocalsound} I don't care about it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we shouldn't talk about that .\nUser Interface: Well I did .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Because {vocalsound} this is a realistic environment .\nProject Manager: Well w why not ? Uh etcetera {gap} {disfmarker} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} N new ideas found ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule {vocalsound} {disfmarker} What ? {vocalsound} For future um meetings {vocalsound} you have got ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I missed uh the option to uh to email ,\nMarketing: Communicate in between .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: Chatting and emailing .\nUser Interface: Email or chat or something .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , right . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but that's one n new idea . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: Well , new ideas found by this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Not . Nothing .\nMarketing: Well , more more information in the beginning .\nProject Manager: We don't want this . We hate this .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Digital pen is useless . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No it isn't .\nProject Manager: Yeah , for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . So it isn't useless .\nProject Manager: But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker} No {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's still an expensive uh expensive {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Because this is huge\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: uh this v very very uh expensive paper .\nUser Interface: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: With the mouse it is {disfmarker} No . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: But if w Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Well and if {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching .\nUser Interface: Uh indeed .\nIndustrial Designer: And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? {vocalsound} A\nProject Manager: Well no . I hated to draw like that . You you can't draw anything uh neat .\nIndustrial Designer: Really ?\nMarketing: Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , {vocalsound} yeah , very precise {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Anything you want . Any b b Yeah . L li li\nProject Manager: I if it if it would be perfect following .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green {gap} uh {gap} school board .\nIndustrial Designer: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is uh is {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , mu\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , board , a school board , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I it has {disfmarker} It is useful . Yeah .\nMarketing: It saves time .\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work ,\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I think then it's pretty useful .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then you can save it immediately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , they are now .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: Celebration .\nProject Manager: It is . So , congratulations crew .\nIndustrial Designer: Did you type that ?\nUser Interface: Hmm . Celebration . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Se {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our {vocalsound} newly earned money . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Finally my beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map .\nUser Interface: But Nils you've got some work left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what you have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: Map , is it a good word ? The folder , yeah .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I have to go to a physiotherapy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh it worked . Two times quick . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Wow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So it is useful , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} It is handy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} This is nice .\nIndustrial Designer: No but uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh great , man .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .\nIndustrial Designer: Radical . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: D design .\nIndustrial Designer: Do you believe it yourself ?\nProject Manager: S Oh . He saved them all ten . Well alright . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well they they wanted everything we produced , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} My big bird . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Your big beautiful bird .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where is this {gap} ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of or the other way around uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you are broken .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I think so too .\nUser Interface: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know . I think she's listening . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I also think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Who is she you're talking about ?\nProject Manager: She already knows . She ? Big brother .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach .\nProject Manager: Our manager .\nIndustrial Designer: Is she also our accountant ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Close your laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Because then we have to confront her with our {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So she can see we're ready .\nMarketing: I feel watched . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics ,\nUser Interface: Yeah . Let's take this remote into uh production .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but we couldn't because of the costs . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That that's the title of our uh end document .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: That that's our new slogan .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Blame our accountants .\nMarketing: Do that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's a nice title . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we couldn't , yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Very catching . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I th Yeah .\nMarketing: I'm sure management would like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: She's on the move .\nProject Manager: I'm going to resign after this project anyway , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the User Interface think of using titanium when discussing product cost and quotation?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the User Interface think of using titanium when discussing product cost and quotation?", "context": "Project Manager: Uh fourth meeting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We have to do what ?\nProject Manager: Some extra deciding .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} W what ? Alri alright . We'll see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: And the video button . The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .\nProject Manager: Well if I look at it , the side the side view {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , at the back {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then you can add suggestions .\nProject Manager: Oh yeah alright . Yeah {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I I don't want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ?\nUser Interface: No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the back . Yeah . {vocalsound} We thought about {disfmarker} Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . {vocalsound} And we thought about the logo big in the middle .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe that's too much\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way .\nUser Interface: No I don't think {disfmarker} And the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: That's basically what we were thinking about ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: W\nUser Interface: And about the side view um {disfmarker} This the front won't be as thick ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I see , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course ,\nProject Manager: Well . Yeah I see it .\nIndustrial Designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .\nUser Interface: Well , it won't be visible . Mm ?\nProject Manager: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Why ? {vocalsound} Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mean uh the the the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: {gap} If y {vocalsound} If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} In the middle in the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: You you have it a bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .\nProject Manager: And how large is it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , that's the question .\nIndustrial Designer: That's the question .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well {disfmarker} Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? {gap} This was Mike's prototype ,\nProject Manager: Well uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it .\nProject Manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: But now you have a totally different {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well , they lay there all the time .\nIndustrial Designer: The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They the the the the the side view ,\nIndustrial Designer: Side ? Uh oh the side ?\nProject Manager: we didn't uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we we he drew the s the side ,\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But you you hold it like this .\nUser Interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it ,\nIndustrial Designer: You're not holding it like this or something .\nUser Interface: you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this .\nProject Manager: No no no .\nIndustrial Designer: You have it more like this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way .\nMarketing: Like you're holding your telephone .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .\nUser Interface: Hmm . That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree on this .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No but but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree\nProject Manager: Yeah well\nUser Interface: and only Nils {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .\nUser Interface: But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . So uh I c I c\nIndustrial Designer: If necessary .\nProject Manager: Well , we'll we we'll do it like this .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable .\nProject Manager: No {disfmarker} No ,\nIndustrial Designer: But do you\nProject Manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} In the market uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think .\nProject Manager: No not totally .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Not totally , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh {vocalsound} every everyone into account . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: And you might be uh {disfmarker} You might be target customer .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't know .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we don't know ,\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe a thousand people ,\nProject Manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research .\nIndustrial Designer: or a million people .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Let it be .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . So that's that .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh any other suggestions ?\nProject Manager: No , I think it's great .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But what about the redesigning ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Comes to that later .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um you . Uh c You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Walter . {vocalsound} You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You're very personal again .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Great .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's more useful than just {vocalsound} speaking .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , this is just a short intro .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this .\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I know , but {vocalsound} I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire .\nProject Manager: To the customers ?\nIndustrial Designer: So and we ha we have answer now ?\nProject Manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , but I can't can s\nProject Manager: Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: But um {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but uh , you know {disfmarker} We dis we di {vocalsound} we designed it to be perfect .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we {vocalsound} we know where we stand .\nProject Manager: Well , one .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten .\nProject Manager: Well so it's point four . Easy to find t\nIndustrial Designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right , so {disfmarker} Right . Uh is it good-looking ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well , I guess uh I think uh {vocalsound} it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . {gap}\nProject Manager: Two . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um {vocalsound} uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: The titanium might be uh f for older people .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It you put uh put a black front on it or something .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh no . {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also {disfmarker} Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and not only for youth uh young people .\nUser Interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . I totally agree .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , the fourteen yeah .\nProject Manager: We we have to get get on , go through this .\nMarketing: Right , a number please .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so .\nMarketing: So the last one is seven .\nUser Interface: Um , no it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Easy to change channels ?\nProject Manager: No , not false . It's one .\nMarketing: Oh , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nProject Manager: Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it {gap} .\nMarketing: Change channels ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: So I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . You {disfmarker} How can you make it any easier ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} With two huge buttons .\nMarketing: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , huge is a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nMarketing: Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?\nProject Manager: Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s\nUser Interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well six then . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: because of the colour . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Six ? Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so ,\nProject Manager: Are the functions easy to learn ?\nIndustrial Designer: but um um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} We have so few functions , so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nUser Interface: Well , I should {disfmarker} I think two ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: because {vocalsound} the voice recorder is n not self learning . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Alright . Two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , but just do some {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} We we {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I th I th I think this is too time consuming .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we take too much time ?\nProject Manager: Uh not not towards you ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: but towards this all .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Th this is {gap} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: We you have to put it to the customers .\nMarketing: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? {vocalsound} R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nProject Manager: Uh well well a bit , so four .\nMarketing: Four . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , very much . One .\nProject Manager: One . And features included also one . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Device fancy feeling .\nIndustrial Designer: And I think fancy-feeling too ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , cool man .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the titanium back . Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's great .\nProject Manager: Is the device easy to use ?\nUser Interface: The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes we have {vocalsound} not many buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: So well maybe two\nProject Manager: Two , three .\nUser Interface: Two {vocalsound} two .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the voice recorder .\nMarketing: Well , with the uh {disfmarker} Three .\nProject Manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?\nUser Interface: T\nIndustrial Designer: F\nProject Manager: Well in our covers , in our fronts .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So yes , one .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . One or two . Yeah .\nUser Interface: One or two , another two .\nMarketing: Nah f four I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Four ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} If you look at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Oh okay . Okay {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well three .\nMarketing: Three , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can also have {gap} front with uh with fruit on it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , that's true .\nProject Manager: Is the material attractive ?\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: This is the last meeting ?\nProject Manager: Yes , but we we have to design much more ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: The average will uh come later .\nProject Manager: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly .\nProject Manager: Oh . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point .\nIndustrial Designer: My god .\nProject Manager: I had to fit it in .\nMarketing: It has to go to twelve , right ?\nProject Manager: I twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four .\nIndustrial Designer: The what ?\nProject Manager: The sample speaker ,\nIndustrial Designer: The {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Out .\nProject Manager: the s sensor .\nMarketing: That's easy . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: Kick it out .\nUser Interface: The what ?\nProject Manager: We have to go to twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Yeah . The speaker .\nProject Manager: The speaker costs far , by far the most .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option .\nMarketing: That's some wrong info , man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It it isn't worth it .\nIndustrial Designer: No . No , d th No .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: We could make two different versions , one with and one without .\nMarketing: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But for this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's just extra . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: So , zero .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we go to fourteen point six .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually .\nMarketing: What more ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Batteries are uh quite {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh no , no no no .\nProject Manager: w a remote control has a battery .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think .\nUser Interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nMarketing: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Can't we do that with a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: Why not ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh that uh y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: because my information says it .\nProject Manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yeah . Regular is normal .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And simple ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Simple .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nothing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Elementary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Your part .\nIndustrial Designer: I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report .\nProject Manager: What happens if we do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Single {disfmarker} Well you have to use a chip . So {disfmarker} Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: How much do we win ? One .\nUser Interface: We we we {disfmarker} Why ?\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: We have very little options furthermore , for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface: Uh well we have to put that in .\nMarketing: Yeah , we need to have the {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: That that's a fact . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there ,\nMarketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but it's only one half .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Nah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it d it doesn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , that's n It's not relevant .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah , you must change the chip uh back .\nProject Manager: then you s then you only have one half left .\nUser Interface: You must change the chip back , Nils .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nMarketing: No , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Then the whole concept is uh\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} we oh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} You can make you can make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: You have to use it .\nMarketing: But if you don't sell\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? No , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Y we don't need both .\nProject Manager: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Says {gap} .\nProject Manager: Says , his {disfmarker} Uh that was in the second meeting , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I I did single curve to {disfmarker} Well you said s double curved ,\nUser Interface: I ?\nProject Manager: uh he ,\nUser Interface: {gap} ?\nProject Manager: because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We can also make it flat .\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} No\nIndustrial Designer: But what what did what do n\nMarketing: no no no .\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What do they mean with the curves ?\nProject Manager: Curved ?\nIndustrial Designer: Is th Is this a curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes , that's curved .\nIndustrial Designer: One curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .\nProject Manager: No , it's one curve .\nIndustrial Designer: It's how you {disfmarker} It's how you look at it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} One curve . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: One curve , simple .\nIndustrial Designer: Well then we have a huge problem I think .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: We have a big financial problem .\nUser Interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy .\nProject Manager: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But {disfmarker} Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah or we could replace it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you if you make it cool to have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: By the way , we also have this one .\nMarketing: Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: Oh , costs nothing . That's nice . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .\nProject Manager: Plastic is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes , but I just got it .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well that's pretty uh l\nUser Interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium ,\nMarketing: That is pretty stupid . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: N not very practical . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: uh titanium-coloured plastic ?\nProject Manager: Who ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You want to dump the titanium ?\nUser Interface: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper .\nProject Manager: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But I'm n I don't agree .\nUser Interface: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again .\nIndustrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .\nUser Interface: Ah no no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same .\nProject Manager: No , I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Well , I do think so .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Y\nProject Manager: Yes . And the feel ,\nUser Interface: {gap} feel .\nProject Manager: and th that it is strong , and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people .\nProject Manager: We still {vocalsound} we had to focus to get more people from the younger group ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but not lose the one {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think the titanium is very important .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then .\nUser Interface: We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think .\nMarketing: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Well what else ?\nUser Interface: No , nothing .\nIndustrial Designer: W I mean uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or you shou {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Amen .\nMarketing: Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Because you have lots of functions {vocalsound} in it too .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well yeah . Alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Why can't I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I agree with that . So we u we use uh {disfmarker} Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic .\nProject Manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back .\nProject Manager: I I'll talk to the managers . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No no no no . W Titanium stays there .\nProject Manager: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah this is good ,\nMarketing: Osl {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but it it's not good enough . {vocalsound} So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .\nProject Manager: Ah those {gap} those account managers , what do th d what do they know ?\nUser Interface: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Come on . Riot . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: What do we {disfmarker} Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes , yes .\nUser Interface: No because we did not know anything about it .\nProject Manager: One and a half Euros . Hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah al alright , yeah .\nMarketing: If you don't have the money , you can't make it .\nIndustrial Designer: But we have to deal with it now . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive .\nProject Manager: So ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So we have to make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: Titanium gone and add plastic .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but then we've got money left .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?\nProject Manager: Well , no it's just uh all plastic .\nIndustrial Designer: No {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well alright . Huh .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh six . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's just free , man .\nIndustrial Designer: A lot of plastic , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Four . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: No two for the to make it clear .\nProject Manager: But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And we still have money left .\nUser Interface: Yeah . W\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do we want , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: I want gold plating .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No no um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah right . I want chrome . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I think uh the case is double curved then .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Because you y have that curve\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have we have to uh fill {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and you have that curve .\nProject Manager: Y Oh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well , th that that is the problem .\nUser Interface: Yeah well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we ha {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: No no no , but th that's not f um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Safe .\nUser Interface: Well y we have curves in all directions .\nIndustrial Designer: Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped ,\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} alright .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so it it can be done . {vocalsound} But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven .\nProject Manager: Finance ?\nUser Interface: I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it .\nProject Manager: Well , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Guys ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We have to dump our titanium ,\nMarketing: Shoot .\nProject Manager: and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Objection .\nUser Interface: Pro project . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project . {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I think it's uh {disfmarker} Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , me too .\nProject Manager: That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason ,\nIndustrial Designer: Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: And uh unrealistic .\nProject Manager: but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .\nUser Interface: Well we we we used our creativity ,\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: but we just had to adapt it to the costs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Which isn't very practical ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nei . Uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but {vocalsound} that's the way .\nProject Manager: Well , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh leadership next .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Terrible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh teamwork ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leadership .\nUser Interface: Leadership ? Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It was very democratic . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh yeah well {vocalsound} I think so also .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But o alright , the teamwork ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess .\nProject Manager: No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Right yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah , think so too .\nProject Manager: Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It was a complete disaster .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} Uh it it it uh it is uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen .\nProject Manager: It's also a It's both the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Or not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard .\nProject Manager: I liked this SMARTboard ,\nIndustrial Designer: That's the digital panel .\nProject Manager: but I hated that one .\nMarketing: This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ?\nProject Manager: Well it's both a SMARTboard .\nIndustrial Designer: That's that's the smart\nMarketing: Yeah right . B but you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh they're both SMARTboards . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: This is just a large t large television .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A televi Yeah .\nMarketing: You u you use the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .\nMarketing: Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , wi w which one did you like ?\nUser Interface: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Left or right ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That one isn't accurate . {vocalsound} It just doesn't work .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .\nMarketing: You can {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes . Th that is so .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I didn't use uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the {vocalsound} these th\nProject Manager: We're now talking about the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't need a SMARTboard .\nUser Interface: {gap} Well we we used that one ,\nIndustrial Designer: Nei It it's much m {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we needed it . I think .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an {disfmarker} I I like it .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay , alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh you can uh {disfmarker} I I sent it about three times now . Uh {vocalsound} a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah , it is .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The simple uh sch school board .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I agree .\nProject Manager: And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ?\nIndustrial Designer: I I didn't use it .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop .\nProject Manager: I used it uh just to check it out , but uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself ,\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} It isn't practical . Right .\nProject Manager: and then you're going to send it , yeah . Well , no .\nIndustrial Designer: W {vocalsound} But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block .\nMarketing: Your notepad . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's , no , it it's useless .\nUser Interface: Well I I drew this . {gap} Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah alright . For drawings ,\nProject Manager: For drawings , yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: but not for personal notes . I think that's not very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} N notes mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I mean {vocalsound} you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: If you've {disfmarker} If you've {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict {disfmarker} Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I understand .\nMarketing: That Stefan use .\nIndustrial Designer: But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . {vocalsound} You can't {disfmarker} It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . It's it's only useful if you have to draw something .\nUser Interface: Yeah . But then uh it's really useful , I think .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep . Alright . Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mu Yeah right .\nProject Manager: Of course great .\nMarketing: Yeah , great . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Can we keep them ? Uh .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: B by my {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wireless uh wireless things .\nUser Interface: Thanks Project Manager . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Other uh things we used here ? I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well these chairs , man . {vocalsound} Really great .\nIndustrial Designer: Well did you really uh {disfmarker} Did you really take uh take those in account ? {vocalsound} I {vocalsound} half of time I didn't notice they were there . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No . I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . {vocalsound} I don't care about it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we shouldn't talk about that .\nUser Interface: Well I did .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Because {vocalsound} this is a realistic environment .\nProject Manager: Well w why not ? Uh etcetera {gap} {disfmarker} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} N new ideas found ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule {vocalsound} {disfmarker} What ? {vocalsound} For future um meetings {vocalsound} you have got ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I missed uh the option to uh to email ,\nMarketing: Communicate in between .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: Chatting and emailing .\nUser Interface: Email or chat or something .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , right . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but that's one n new idea . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: Well , new ideas found by this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Not . Nothing .\nMarketing: Well , more more information in the beginning .\nProject Manager: We don't want this . We hate this .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Digital pen is useless . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No it isn't .\nProject Manager: Yeah , for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . So it isn't useless .\nProject Manager: But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker} No {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's still an expensive uh expensive {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Because this is huge\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: uh this v very very uh expensive paper .\nUser Interface: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: With the mouse it is {disfmarker} No . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: But if w Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Well and if {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching .\nUser Interface: Uh indeed .\nIndustrial Designer: And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? {vocalsound} A\nProject Manager: Well no . I hated to draw like that . You you can't draw anything uh neat .\nIndustrial Designer: Really ?\nMarketing: Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , {vocalsound} yeah , very precise {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Anything you want . Any b b Yeah . L li li\nProject Manager: I if it if it would be perfect following .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green {gap} uh {gap} school board .\nIndustrial Designer: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is uh is {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , mu\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , board , a school board , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I it has {disfmarker} It is useful . Yeah .\nMarketing: It saves time .\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work ,\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I think then it's pretty useful .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then you can save it immediately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , they are now .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: Celebration .\nProject Manager: It is . So , congratulations crew .\nIndustrial Designer: Did you type that ?\nUser Interface: Hmm . Celebration . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Se {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our {vocalsound} newly earned money . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Finally my beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map .\nUser Interface: But Nils you've got some work left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what you have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: Map , is it a good word ? The folder , yeah .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I have to go to a physiotherapy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh it worked . Two times quick . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Wow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So it is useful , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} It is handy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} This is nice .\nIndustrial Designer: No but uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh great , man .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .\nIndustrial Designer: Radical . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: D design .\nIndustrial Designer: Do you believe it yourself ?\nProject Manager: S Oh . He saved them all ten . Well alright . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well they they wanted everything we produced , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} My big bird . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Your big beautiful bird .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where is this {gap} ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of or the other way around uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you are broken .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I think so too .\nUser Interface: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know . I think she's listening . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I also think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Who is she you're talking about ?\nProject Manager: She already knows . She ? Big brother .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach .\nProject Manager: Our manager .\nIndustrial Designer: Is she also our accountant ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Close your laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Because then we have to confront her with our {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So she can see we're ready .\nMarketing: I feel watched . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics ,\nUser Interface: Yeah . Let's take this remote into uh production .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but we couldn't because of the costs . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That that's the title of our uh end document .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: That that's our new slogan .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Blame our accountants .\nMarketing: Do that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's a nice title . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we couldn't , yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Very catching . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I th Yeah .\nMarketing: I'm sure management would like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: She's on the move .\nProject Manager: I'm going to resign after this project anyway , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}", "answers": ["The User Interface thought it was reasonable to replace the titanium with titanium-coloured plastic.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . {vocalsound} Uh y getting close to the last\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: is the penultim meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: How was lunch ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm great . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Thanks {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Don't be sarcastic . {vocalsound} Mark . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .\nMarketing: Uh Rama .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ramaro .\nProject Manager: Um um we have to take a decision on the control {disfmarker} remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: So what we want to {disfmarker} the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ?\nMarketing: L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface: L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh l\nMarketing: Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh\nUser Interface: No ,\nIndustrial Designer: it's like a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus .\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , so let's try it , let's t\nIndustrial Designer: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or {gap} or something so we want to reduce the cost on display\nMarketing: {gap} The L_C_D_ would {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: or this inter\nMarketing: The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .\nMarketing: Just uh for output , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: because like it won't take much money I guess ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , yep .\nProject Manager: {gap} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: You have any further questions or ?\nMarketing: I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: for really light batteries and with uh good price .\nMarketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be {disfmarker} ask .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's {disfmarker} then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it {disfmarker} m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology\nProject Manager: Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer: and so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: for the location . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , if if everybody in the house n {gap} to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . So let's now go to the {disfmarker} you don't have more question ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: No , it's okay .\nProject Manager: Um mm thank you mm .\nUser Interface: No more questions .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . Thank you .\nMarketing: Puts less of constraint on what we can do\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: but\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: it's always like that . We have dreams and the {disfmarker} in the end we find out that it's not feasible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . We have uh some limitations {gap} . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice ,\nMarketing: L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: L_C_ {vocalsound}\nMarketing: L_S_D_ is something else ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and it's quite nice as well . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I'm an artist , sorry . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So ,\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh , that's not {disfmarker}\nMarketing: go on uh artist . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I hope that's not too much .\nProject Manager: Now let's talk about uh interface .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Uh participant number three .\nProject Manager: Three .\nIndustrial Designer: Three .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh\nProject Manager: Which one ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: mm mm uh have a look at this {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: no it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh we got explanation for every button\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no {gap} ? I can see nothing . So that's our concept . It's called the millennium remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Let's change millenniums . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: maybe you can use {gap} in the end and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} doesn't make sense . This is very {vocalsound} ugly .\nUser Interface: Really ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I thought you like it . Ah okay\nMarketing: Oh no ,\nUser Interface: just press the button , please uh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: too much concept .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But instead of this I will devise {disfmarker} That's our concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , back today . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . 'Kay .\nUser Interface: And uh what will people say ? They'll say it's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {gap} Do you think it can come in several colours ?\nUser Interface: And everyone's gonna be satisfied .\nMarketing: Or did the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .\nMarketing: Um but not the case .\nUser Interface: Not the case .\nMarketing: Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .\nMarketing: Mm yeah , okay ,\nUser Interface: Do you like it ?\nMarketing: so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: but I don't use that but again , uh I might {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's why you don't have it . That's why ,\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: 'cause it's nasty . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: bu but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we can just {disfmarker} if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .\nUser Interface: Um , I am here .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So users have different {disfmarker} I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So ?\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we can just {disfmarker} if they want they can just pay another two Euro .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh , okay , so\nUser Interface: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we {disfmarker} if you want o more colours {vocalsound} on L_C_D_ ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh {disfmarker} so that we can {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Kind of upgradable uh {vocalsound} remote control .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Wow , wow .\nIndustrial Designer: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours .\nUser Interface: Okay , what uh {disfmarker} there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um {vocalsound} 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature ,\nIndustrial Designer: Lights , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Like a chameleon .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: We can make it in fact .\nProject Manager: Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah .\nUser Interface: If if if the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: okay .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: But uh it can be in uh maybe in an {disfmarker} a gradable version ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ,\nProject Manager: but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but {disfmarker} and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And that makes me special .\nProject Manager: Okay\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of {vocalsound} uh o or this is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .\nProject Manager: Okay , so\nMarketing: Those who wanted to have it pink .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} i it's not uh a s base service\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No mm no .\nProject Manager: it's a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: {gap} be an option ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nMarketing: It might be optional , yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can {gap} those {disfmarker}\nMarketing: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah .\nMarketing: Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So m so\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: maybe that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: yeah . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And you'll be different .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And it makes you different ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface: you know ?\nMarketing: You always have your remote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . {vocalsound} Want to change my neighbour .\nUser Interface: Anyone has their remote controls here ?\nMarketing: Oh , you don't ? {vocalsound} Yeah . You don't have your remo {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . {vocalsound} Uh it's white\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: It has this distinctive look and feel and look {gap} which people seems to like {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: just because it's {vocalsound} a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?\nMarketing: Seems important .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light ,\nMarketing: Mm {gap} glow in the dark ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah\nMarketing: so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so that like {disfmarker} at least um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Iradium ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah sorry . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay . S well ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: let's go on maybe with the presentation .\nMarketing: Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And um the remote control's going to be smart\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nUser Interface: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And uh\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I dunno\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's a question to you and to mm to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I dunno . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm , that's a nice world . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} So just just just just think about it um .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} Thank you .\nMarketing: Don't touch the remote .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want .\nUser Interface: Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .\nMarketing: Like with some {disfmarker} Maybe fingerprint recognition or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Voice recognition is quite tough . I say don't use it , and the control just looks .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it .\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh that {disfmarker} mm that could be feasible I guess , like {disfmarker} So since we have {disfmarker} we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay . So it could be smart in that way .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . Okay .\nMarketing: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh {disfmarker} things like that\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: I dunno , that might be expensive\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: but\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that might also be a good sales pitch again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} The remote that knows you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , thanks .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: My turn ?\nProject Manager: yeah , Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {gap} Okay , it's alright .\nProject Manager: Participant two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Four .\nProject Manager: Four ,\nMarketing: Four , I think .\nProject Manager: sorry .\nMarketing: Trend , yeah . No uh yes . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on {vocalsound} how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people {gap} have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh {vocalsound} example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also {disfmarker} have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So anyway uh next slide please . {vocalsound} Uh to be to be quick {vocalsound} there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are {disfmarker} uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very {disfmarker} pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh {vocalsound} it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Next slide please .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so {disfmarker} currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of {vocalsound} of look or feel\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or so . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And I think of course uh {vocalsound} i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends . {vocalsound} It it can travel f from clothe to furniture {vocalsound} same idea .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . {vocalsound} And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: What is spongy ?\nMarketing: yeah . Well\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah\nMarketing: this {vocalsound} so so I think uh uh i\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} kind of um maybe {disfmarker} {gap}\nMarketing: When we were talking about rubber ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {gap} We need to think about {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: Seems not , seems not .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} sorry Mark .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It seems to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy ,\nIndustrial Designer: Fruit . Even shape ?\nMarketing: as a {disfmarker} even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} More {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} You're old-fashioned .\nMarketing: So that's what people seem to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought\nProject Manager: Sorry . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but that's that's fashion and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay that's all I have to say .\nProject Manager: Mm you have questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: These {disfmarker} I'm sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: This {disfmarker} you you {gap} so did you {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course ,\nIndustrial Designer: Where ? Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends\nIndustrial Designer: It's not from {disfmarker} mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: that are also {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's more general trend\nMarketing: well .\nIndustrial Designer: it's not particular to the remote control .\nMarketing: No , it's not it's not {disfmarker} this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .\nMarketing: The {disfmarker} what we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy\nMarketing: Sure .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nMarketing: We have to {disfmarker} I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: but we still have to put our chips inside , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of course .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah\nMarketing: This is your problem .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: that {disfmarker} yeah yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is not mine . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , looking {disfmarker} yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape\nMarketing: Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If if it's something like rubber made or {disfmarker} I think it it's also going to be good .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay ?\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} No more question ? Okay .\nMarketing: Yep . Thanks .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design ,\nIndustrial Designer: Look and feel de\nProject Manager: um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . {vocalsound} Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Hmm . Mm sounds interesting . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm um and I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Thanks . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , can we highlight the specific features of our {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah you're right , you have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables ,\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you say s\nIndustrial Designer: we want to follow general trend .\nMarketing: Spongy .\nProject Manager: S\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: do we agree on that ? Yeah . We have to .\nIndustrial Designer: So , do you think {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} No , we don't have to ,\nUser Interface: So we have to uh for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but seems it's the trend .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Yeah .\nMarketing: Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .\nUser Interface: yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So there's no {disfmarker} Well , that's {disfmarker} you t can try to convince us .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well , we can make it smell like fruit . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound} {gap} that's a good idea ,\nProject Manager: Okay , {vocalsound} that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So titanium smell like fruit .\nMarketing: I {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like {disfmarker} They more want these fancy features\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker} I think i\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker}\nMarketing: yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright , alright .\nProject Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . So\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing: We're done .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So see you in thirty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about trend watching and appearance design.\nAnswer:", "input": "Summarize the discussion about trend watching and appearance design.", "context": "Project Manager: Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . {vocalsound} Uh y getting close to the last\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: is the penultim meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: How was lunch ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm great . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Thanks {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Don't be sarcastic . {vocalsound} Mark . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .\nMarketing: Uh Rama .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ramaro .\nProject Manager: Um um we have to take a decision on the control {disfmarker} remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: So what we want to {disfmarker} the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ?\nMarketing: L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface: L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh l\nMarketing: Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh\nUser Interface: No ,\nIndustrial Designer: it's like a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus .\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , so let's try it , let's t\nIndustrial Designer: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or {gap} or something so we want to reduce the cost on display\nMarketing: {gap} The L_C_D_ would {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: or this inter\nMarketing: The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .\nMarketing: Just uh for output , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: because like it won't take much money I guess ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , yep .\nProject Manager: {gap} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: You have any further questions or ?\nMarketing: I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: for really light batteries and with uh good price .\nMarketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be {disfmarker} ask .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's {disfmarker} then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it {disfmarker} m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology\nProject Manager: Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer: and so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: for the location . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , if if everybody in the house n {gap} to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . So let's now go to the {disfmarker} you don't have more question ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: No , it's okay .\nProject Manager: Um mm thank you mm .\nUser Interface: No more questions .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . Thank you .\nMarketing: Puts less of constraint on what we can do\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: but\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: it's always like that . We have dreams and the {disfmarker} in the end we find out that it's not feasible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . We have uh some limitations {gap} . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice ,\nMarketing: L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: L_C_ {vocalsound}\nMarketing: L_S_D_ is something else ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and it's quite nice as well . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I'm an artist , sorry . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So ,\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh , that's not {disfmarker}\nMarketing: go on uh artist . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I hope that's not too much .\nProject Manager: Now let's talk about uh interface .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Uh participant number three .\nProject Manager: Three .\nIndustrial Designer: Three .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh\nProject Manager: Which one ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: mm mm uh have a look at this {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: no it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh we got explanation for every button\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no {gap} ? I can see nothing . So that's our concept . It's called the millennium remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Let's change millenniums . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: maybe you can use {gap} in the end and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} doesn't make sense . This is very {vocalsound} ugly .\nUser Interface: Really ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I thought you like it . Ah okay\nMarketing: Oh no ,\nUser Interface: just press the button , please uh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: too much concept .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But instead of this I will devise {disfmarker} That's our concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , back today . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . 'Kay .\nUser Interface: And uh what will people say ? They'll say it's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {gap} Do you think it can come in several colours ?\nUser Interface: And everyone's gonna be satisfied .\nMarketing: Or did the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .\nMarketing: Um but not the case .\nUser Interface: Not the case .\nMarketing: Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .\nMarketing: Mm yeah , okay ,\nUser Interface: Do you like it ?\nMarketing: so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: but I don't use that but again , uh I might {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's why you don't have it . That's why ,\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: 'cause it's nasty . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: bu but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we can just {disfmarker} if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .\nUser Interface: Um , I am here .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So users have different {disfmarker} I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So ?\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we can just {disfmarker} if they want they can just pay another two Euro .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh , okay , so\nUser Interface: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we {disfmarker} if you want o more colours {vocalsound} on L_C_D_ ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh {disfmarker} so that we can {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Kind of upgradable uh {vocalsound} remote control .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Wow , wow .\nIndustrial Designer: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours .\nUser Interface: Okay , what uh {disfmarker} there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um {vocalsound} 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature ,\nIndustrial Designer: Lights , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Like a chameleon .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: We can make it in fact .\nProject Manager: Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah .\nUser Interface: If if if the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: okay .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: But uh it can be in uh maybe in an {disfmarker} a gradable version ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ,\nProject Manager: but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but {disfmarker} and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And that makes me special .\nProject Manager: Okay\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of {vocalsound} uh o or this is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .\nProject Manager: Okay , so\nMarketing: Those who wanted to have it pink .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} i it's not uh a s base service\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No mm no .\nProject Manager: it's a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: {gap} be an option ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nMarketing: It might be optional , yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can {gap} those {disfmarker}\nMarketing: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah .\nMarketing: Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So m so\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: maybe that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: yeah . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And you'll be different .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And it makes you different ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface: you know ?\nMarketing: You always have your remote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . {vocalsound} Want to change my neighbour .\nUser Interface: Anyone has their remote controls here ?\nMarketing: Oh , you don't ? {vocalsound} Yeah . You don't have your remo {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . {vocalsound} Uh it's white\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: It has this distinctive look and feel and look {gap} which people seems to like {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: just because it's {vocalsound} a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?\nMarketing: Seems important .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light ,\nMarketing: Mm {gap} glow in the dark ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah\nMarketing: so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so that like {disfmarker} at least um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Iradium ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah sorry . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay . S well ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: let's go on maybe with the presentation .\nMarketing: Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And um the remote control's going to be smart\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nUser Interface: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And uh\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I dunno\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's a question to you and to mm to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I dunno . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm , that's a nice world . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} So just just just just think about it um .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} Thank you .\nMarketing: Don't touch the remote .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want .\nUser Interface: Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .\nMarketing: Like with some {disfmarker} Maybe fingerprint recognition or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Voice recognition is quite tough . I say don't use it , and the control just looks .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it .\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh that {disfmarker} mm that could be feasible I guess , like {disfmarker} So since we have {disfmarker} we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay . So it could be smart in that way .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . Okay .\nMarketing: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh {disfmarker} things like that\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: I dunno , that might be expensive\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: but\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that might also be a good sales pitch again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} The remote that knows you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , thanks .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: My turn ?\nProject Manager: yeah , Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {gap} Okay , it's alright .\nProject Manager: Participant two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Four .\nProject Manager: Four ,\nMarketing: Four , I think .\nProject Manager: sorry .\nMarketing: Trend , yeah . No uh yes . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on {vocalsound} how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people {gap} have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh {vocalsound} example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also {disfmarker} have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So anyway uh next slide please . {vocalsound} Uh to be to be quick {vocalsound} there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are {disfmarker} uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very {disfmarker} pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh {vocalsound} it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Next slide please .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so {disfmarker} currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of {vocalsound} of look or feel\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or so . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And I think of course uh {vocalsound} i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends . {vocalsound} It it can travel f from clothe to furniture {vocalsound} same idea .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . {vocalsound} And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: What is spongy ?\nMarketing: yeah . Well\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah\nMarketing: this {vocalsound} so so I think uh uh i\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} kind of um maybe {disfmarker} {gap}\nMarketing: When we were talking about rubber ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {gap} We need to think about {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: Seems not , seems not .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} sorry Mark .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It seems to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy ,\nIndustrial Designer: Fruit . Even shape ?\nMarketing: as a {disfmarker} even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} More {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} You're old-fashioned .\nMarketing: So that's what people seem to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought\nProject Manager: Sorry . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but that's that's fashion and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay that's all I have to say .\nProject Manager: Mm you have questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: These {disfmarker} I'm sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: This {disfmarker} you you {gap} so did you {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course ,\nIndustrial Designer: Where ? Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends\nIndustrial Designer: It's not from {disfmarker} mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: that are also {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's more general trend\nMarketing: well .\nIndustrial Designer: it's not particular to the remote control .\nMarketing: No , it's not it's not {disfmarker} this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .\nMarketing: The {disfmarker} what we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy\nMarketing: Sure .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nMarketing: We have to {disfmarker} I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: but we still have to put our chips inside , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of course .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah\nMarketing: This is your problem .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: that {disfmarker} yeah yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is not mine . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , looking {disfmarker} yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape\nMarketing: Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If if it's something like rubber made or {disfmarker} I think it it's also going to be good .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay ?\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} No more question ? Okay .\nMarketing: Yep . Thanks .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design ,\nIndustrial Designer: Look and feel de\nProject Manager: um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . {vocalsound} Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Hmm . Mm sounds interesting . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm um and I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: Thanks . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , can we highlight the specific features of our {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah you're right , you have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables ,\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you say s\nIndustrial Designer: we want to follow general trend .\nMarketing: Spongy .\nProject Manager: S\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: do we agree on that ? Yeah . We have to .\nIndustrial Designer: So , do you think {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} No , we don't have to ,\nUser Interface: So we have to uh for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but seems it's the trend .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Yeah .\nMarketing: Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .\nUser Interface: yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So there's no {disfmarker} Well , that's {disfmarker} you t can try to convince us .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well , we can make it smell like fruit . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound} {gap} that's a good idea ,\nProject Manager: Okay , {vocalsound} that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So titanium smell like fruit .\nMarketing: I {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like {disfmarker} They more want these fancy features\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker} I think i\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker}\nMarketing: yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: because we have it\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and others don't .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah it's it's\nMarketing: Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer: and d Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface: Yeah\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing: If you have time .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface: I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nMarketing: No problem .

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProfessor B: I think for two years we were two months , uh , away from being done .\nPhD A: And what was that , Morgan ? What project ?\nProfessor B: Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .\nPhD A: Oh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . We were two {disfmarker} we were {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh , uh , we went through it {disfmarker} Jim and I went through old emails at one point and {disfmarker} and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're two months away from being done . It was very {disfmarker} very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and {disfmarker} with the schedules {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}\nPhD A: It was true for two years .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true .\nPhD A: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we {pause} go around and do , uh , status report {pause} kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So .\nProfessor B: Yeah . So we {pause} probably should wait for him to come before we do his .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: OK . That 's a good idea .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Any objection ? Do y OK , M\nProfessor B: All in favor\nPhD A: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B: Uh , I don't do anything . I {disfmarker} No , I mean , I {disfmarker} I 'm involved in discussions with {disfmarker} with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're {disfmarker} since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .\nGrad F: OK . So should I go so that , uh ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?\nGrad F: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad F: OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my {disfmarker} my proposal . So , um {disfmarker} Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh {disfmarker} on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a {disfmarker} as a middle step . And , um , I hope to {disfmarker} hope to get this , um {disfmarker} a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .\nPhD A: When is your , uh , meeting ?\nGrad F: Um , my meeting\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: with , uh {disfmarker} ? Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for that {disfmarker} for that part I would {disfmarker} I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for {disfmarker} for Switchboard . And I 'd run some {disfmarker} some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers .\nPhD A: Oh . So that 's why you were interested in getting your own features into the SRI files .\nGrad F: Yeah . That 's why I {disfmarker} I was asking about that .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah . Um , and I guess that 's {disfmarker} that 's it . Any {disfmarker} any questions ?\nPhD A: Sounds good . So you just have a few more weeks , huh ?\nGrad F: Um , yeah . A few more .\nPhD A: It 's about a month from now ?\nGrad F: It 's a {disfmarker} it 's a month and {disfmarker} and a week .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , uh , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we {disfmarker} we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , {vocalsound} six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um , {vocalsound} considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK {disfmarker} sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't . Um , so this , um {disfmarker} This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel {pause} normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the {disfmarker} Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts {pause} in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have {pause} different phones {pause} lined up with a different foreground phone , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} depending on {pause} the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um {disfmarker} Hmm .\nProfessor B: I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about {disfmarker} we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that {disfmarker} some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy {pause} sections ? Um , uh , if you {disfmarker} if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in {pause} late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a {disfmarker} an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what {disfmarker} what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero {disfmarker} set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a {disfmarker} a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in {disfmarker} So in this case you have some artificially imposed {pause} reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did {disfmarker} ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the {disfmarker} the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some {disfmarker} some , uh , very low or {disfmarker} or near zero {pause} value . I mean , uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that {disfmarker} that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: or pre - echoes , whichever they are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Be pretty simple . I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to {pause} keep in an echo than to throw out speech .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD G: Um , what is the reverberation time {pause} like {pause} there ?\nGrad E: In thi in this room ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD G: On , uh , the {disfmarker} the one what {disfmarker} the s in the speech that you are {disfmarker} you are using like ?\nGrad E: Y Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know .\nProfessor B: So , it 's this room .\nPhD G: It 's , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: It 's {disfmarker} it 's this room .\nPhD G: Oh , this room ?\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: so it 's {disfmarker} these are just microphone {disfmarker} this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on .\nGrad F: Oh .\nProfessor B: Uh , we should do a measurement in here . I g think we never have . I think it 's {disfmarker} I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T\nGrad F: Hmm !\nProfessor B: something like that ? But it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's this room .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD G: OK . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh . But the other thing is , he 's putting in {disfmarker} w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways . He 's also putting in , uh , a {disfmarker} he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has {pause} averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be {disfmarker} you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't . And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away . Uh , and if it 's a low {pause} energy compo portion , you might actually hear some {pause} funny things .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nGrad E: O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is {pause} just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I don't see why {disfmarker} why your signal is louder after processing , because yo\nGrad E: Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah . I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have {pause} better signal - to - noise ratio .\nPhD C: Well , well {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But just it being bigger if {disfmarker} with the same signal - to - noise ratio {disfmarker}\nGrad E: It w i i it wouldn't affect things .\nProfessor B: No .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: Well , the system is {disfmarker} use {pause} the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on {disfmarker} on the {pause} signal level . But , not so much , I guess .\nProfessor B: Well , yeah . But it 's trained and tested on the same thing .\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor B: So if the {disfmarker} if the {disfmarker} if you change {vocalsound} in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD A: Did you add {pause} this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ?\nGrad E: Uh {disfmarker} Um . Did I w what ?\nPhD A: Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect .\nGrad E: Sorry ? Yeah .\nPhD A: But I {disfmarker} I was {pause} sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I b\nPhD A: You didn't {pause} train it also .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} Right . I trained on clean TI - digits . I {disfmarker} I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits . But I didn't {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder .\nProfessor B: Oh , I see .\nGrad E: I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder .\nProfessor B: OK . Well , I don't understand then . Yeah .\nGrad E: Huh . I don't know . If it 's {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} like , if it 's trying to find a {disfmarker} a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter . And then if you take it out {disfmarker} that taking it out makes things louder . I mean .\nProfessor B: Uh , no . I mean , {vocalsound} uh , there 's {disfmarker} there 's nothing inherent about removing {disfmarker} if you 're really removing ,\nGrad E: Nuh - huh .\nProfessor B: uh , r uh , then I don't {pause} see how that would make it louder .\nGrad E: The mean . OK . Yeah , I see .\nProfessor B: So it might be just some {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . So I should maybe listen to that stuff again .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It might just be some artifact of the processing that {disfmarker} that , uh , if you 're {disfmarker} Uh , yeah . I don't know .\nGrad E: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: I wonder if there could be something like , uh {disfmarker} for s for the PZM data ,\nPhD C: Eh\nPhD A: uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . Uh . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um {disfmarker} you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it {disfmarker} it could cause {pause} you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , you know , there is this . Wait a minute . It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} i maybe {disfmarker} i If , um {disfmarker} Subtracting the {disfmarker} the mean log spectrum is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your {disfmarker} if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a {disfmarker} a question of {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . That 's something to think about .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: I had a question about the system {disfmarker} the SRI system . So , {vocalsound} you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on {pause} Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . Uh , but is it {pause} exactly the same system ?\nGrad E: Uh . I think so .\nPhD C: Hmm .\nGrad E: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , um , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um , like MLLR transformations also ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a {disfmarker} a result on testing on Macrophone or {disfmarker} or training ?\nPhD C: all that stuff .\nGrad E: That 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: It was {pause} training on Macrophone and testing {disfmarker} yeah , on {disfmarker} on meeting digits .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that was done already . So we were {disfmarker} Uh , and it 's point eight ? OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I 've just been text {comment} testing the new {pause} Aurora front - end with {disfmarker} well , Aurora system actually {disfmarker} so front - end and HTK , um , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . We have {disfmarker} I have two point seven percent error rate . And before with the system that was proposed , it 's what ? It was three point nine . So .\nProfessor B: Oh , that 's a lot better .\nPhD C: We are getting better .\nProfessor B: So , what {disfmarker} w ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: With the {disfmarker} with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ?\nPhD C: Yeah . Two point seven .\nPhD G: I know in the meeting , like {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the meeting we have two point seven .\nPhD G: Right . Oh .\nGrad F: That 's with the new IIR filters ?\nPhD C: Uh . Yeah , yeah . So , yeah ,\nGrad F: OK .\nPhD C: we have {pause} the new LDA filters , and {disfmarker} I think , maybe {disfmarker} I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation . Uh , eh {disfmarker} Do y did you have a look at {disfmarker} at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I didn't . No .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD G: No . The DC component could be negligible . I mean , if you are {pause} recording it through a mike . I mean , any {disfmarker} all of the mikes have the DC removal {disfmarker} some capacitor sitting right in {pause} that bias it .\nProfessor B: Yeah . But this {disfmarker} uh , uh , uh , no . Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold in the A - toD. And these period these typically do have a DC offset .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: And {disfmarker} and they can be surprisingly large . It depends on the electronics .\nPhD G: Oh , so it is the digital {disfmarker} OK . It 's the A - toD that introduces the DC in .\nProfessor B: Yeah . The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC .\nPhD G: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: typi you know , unless {disfmarker} Actually , there are {pause} instrumentation mikes that {disfmarker} that do pass {disfmarker} go down to DC . But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: uh , no , it 's the electronics . And they {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: then there 's amplification afterwards . And you can get , I think it was {disfmarker} I think it was in the {pause} Wall Street Journal data that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I can't remember , one of the DARPA things . There was this big DC - DC offset\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: we didn't {disfmarker} we didn't know about for a while , while we were {pause} messing with it . And we were getting these terrible results . And then we were talking to somebody and they said , \" Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ? Everybody knows that . There 's all this DC offset in th \" So , yes . You can have DC offset in the data .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD G: OK .\nPhD A: So was that {disfmarker} was that everything , Dave ?\nGrad E: Oh . And I also , um , did some experiments {pause} about normalizing the phase . Um . So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at . And , um , the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea , um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases . They {disfmarker} they add in this modulo two pi way and , um , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really {pause} mathematically correct . So , {vocalsound} what I did instead is I {vocalsound} took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase {pause} off to normalize . But that , um , didn't work either .\nProfessor B: See , we have a different interpretation of this . He says it doesn't work . I said , I think it works magnificently , but just not for the task we intended . Uh , it gets rid of the speech .\nPhD A: What does it leave ?\nGrad F: Uh , gets rid of the speech .\nProfessor B: Uh , it leaves {disfmarker} you know , it leaves the junk . I mean , I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's tremendous .\nGrad F: Oh , wow .\nProfessor B: You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something .\nPhD A: Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ?\nProfessor B: Ex - exactly . Yeah , you got it .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a general rule .\nPhD G: Oh , it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . Including what I just said .\nGrad E: And , yeah , that 's everything .\nPhD A: All set ? Do you want to go , Stephane ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . Maybe , concerning these d still , these meeting digits . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because {pause} this is also one big difference between {pause} the two systems . Um , the other differences were {pause} the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more {disfmarker} SRI system are more complex . But , uh , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and\nPhD A: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system .\nPhD C: it was hard t to {disfmarker} to have some exper some improvement with this . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , it sounds like they also have {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he 's saying they have all these , uh , uh , different kinds of adaptation .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: You know , they have channel adaptation . They have speaker adaptation .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right .\nPhD A: Well , there 's also the normalization .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Like they do , um {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits ,\nPhD C: The vocal tr\nPhD A: but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's , um {disfmarker} conversation - side normalization for the {pause} non - C - zero components ,\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . This is another difference . Their normalization works like on {disfmarker} on the utterance levels .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But we have to do it {disfmarker} We have a system that does it on - line .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: So , it might be {disfmarker} it might be better with {disfmarker} it might be worse if the {pause} channel is constant ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: or {disfmarker} Nnn .\nPhD G: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or {disfmarker} or is it the whole word ?\nPhD C: SRI {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's tr\nGrad F: SRI .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . I guess it 's triphones .\nPhD G: It 's triphone .\nProfessor B: I think it 's probably more than that .\nPhD C: Huh .\nProfessor B: I mean , so they {disfmarker} they have {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thin think they use these , uh , uh , genone things . So there 's {disfmarker} there 's these kind of , uh , uh , pooled models and {disfmarker} and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies .\nPhD G: Oh . It 's like the tied state .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: They have tied states and I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . But I think {disfmarker} I think they {disfmarker} they don't just have triphones .\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: I think they have a range of {disfmarker} of , uh , dependencies .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Yeah . Well . Um . Well , the first thing I {disfmarker} that I want to do is just maybe these gender things . Uh . And maybe see with {pause} Andreas if {disfmarker} Well , I {disfmarker} I don't know {pause} how much it helps , what 's the model .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ?\nPhD C: That 's right . So it 's the clean {pause} TI - digits training set .\nPhD A: So exact same training data ?\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I guess you used the clean training set .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: For {disfmarker} with the SRI system {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Well .\nGrad E: You know , the {disfmarker} the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , um , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , um , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . But I don't think there 's any other difference .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B: So is that {disfmarker} ? Uh , are {disfmarker} are these results comparable ? So you {disfmarker} you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent {pause} on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits {disfmarker} {comment} TI - digits . Right ? And {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ?\nPhD C: Yeah . I think so .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So it 's {pause} about the same ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: maybe a little worse .\nGrad E: W w it was one {disfmarker} one point two\nPhD C: Ye\nGrad E: with the SRI system ,\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The complete SRI system is one point two .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you were HTK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right ? OK . That 's right . So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK , so {pause} the comparable number then , uh {pause} for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the {pause} um , two point f\nPhD C: It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , uh , b\nGrad E: D d\nProfessor B: Oh , right , right , right , right .\nPhD C: MFCC features {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent .\nProfessor B: Right . Right , right , right .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: OK . Alright . So {disfmarker} He 's doing some {pause} different things .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker} Yeah . The only difference is the features , right now , between this and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yes . OK , good . So they are helping .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: That 's good to hear . Yeah .\nPhD C: They are helping . Yeah . Um . Yeah . And another thing I {disfmarker} I maybe would like to do is to {pause} just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone {disfmarker} test it on , uh , the noisy TI - digits ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: cuz I 'm still wondering {pause} where this {pause} improvement comes from . When you train on Macrophone , it seems better on meeting digits . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe {pause} Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than {disfmarker} than TI - digit is , which is {disfmarker} TI - digits are very {pause} clean recorded digits\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know , it would also be interesting to see , uh {disfmarker} to do the regular Aurora test ,\nPhD C: Uh , f s\nPhD A: um , but use the SRI system instead of HTK .\nPhD C: That 's {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's what {pause} I wanted , just , uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So , just using the SRI system , test it on {disfmarker} and test it on {pause} Aurora TI - digits . Right .\nPhD A: Why not the full Aurora , uh , test ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . There is this problem of multilinguality yet .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: So we don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: You 'd have to train the SRI system with {disfmarker} with all the different languages .\nPhD C: i i\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: We would have to train on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . That 's what I mean .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , like , comple\nProfessor B: It 'd be a {pause} lot of work . That 's the only thing .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well , I mean ,\nPhD C: Mmm .\nPhD A: uh , uh , I guess the work would be into getting the {disfmarker} the files in the right formats , or something . Right ? I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're , uh {disfmarker} you 're also training on all the data .\nPhD C: That 's right .\nPhD A: I mean , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . I see . Oh , so , OK . Right . I see what you mean .\nProfessor B: That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: because {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a good idea , but it seems like {pause} it makes sense to do some pruning\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: first with a {disfmarker} a test or two that makes sense for you ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then {pause} take the likely candidates and go further .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information {pause} about what 's going on . And {disfmarker} mm - hmm . Uh , yeah . OK . Uh , the next thing is this {disfmarker} this VAD problem that , um , um {disfmarker} So , I 'm just talking about the {disfmarker} the curves that I {disfmarker} I sent {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I sent you {disfmarker} so , whi that shows that {vocalsound} when the SNR decrease , {vocalsound} uh , the current {pause} VAD approach doesn't drop much frames {pause} for some particular noises , uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically .\nProfessor B: I i Just to clarify something for me . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So does any of this matter ? I mean , other than our interest in it . Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Uh {disfmarker} Well . First of all , the boundaries might be , uh {disfmarker} like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or {disfmarker} before and after speech . Uh . So removing more than that might still make {pause} a difference {pause} in the results .\nProfessor B: Do we {disfmarker} ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} No . Because we don't {disfmarker} didn't looked {pause} that much at that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: But , {vocalsound} still , I think it 's an interesting problem .\nProfessor B: Oh , yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when {disfmarker} when , uh , the gang gets back from Crete . Because {pause} there 's lots of interesting problems , of course .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: And then the thing is if {disfmarker} if they really are going to have some means of giving us {pause} fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue .\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Um But {vocalsound} I don't know .\nPhD G: Because w we were wondering whether that {pause} VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if {disfmarker} if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: to find a {disfmarker} I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more {pause} suitable for us .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't {pause} use that information anymore ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: So . We don't know what is the type of {pause} {vocalsound} {pause} VAD which they 're going to provide .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . And actually there 's {disfmarker} Yeah . There 's an {disfmarker} uh , I think it 's still for {disfmarker} even for the evaluation , uh , it might still be interesting to {vocalsound} work on this because {pause} the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , {vocalsound} um , starting of speech and end of speech {pause} uh , at the utterance level . And {disfmarker} Um .\nPhD G: With some {disfmarker} some gap .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that {disfmarker} whatever the hang - over time which they are talking .\nPhD C: Yeah . But when you have like , uh , five or six frames , both {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Yeah . Then the they will just fill {disfmarker} fill it up .\nPhD C: it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , th {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So if you could get at some of that , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: although that 'd be hard .\nPhD C: Yeah . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other {pause} things that we want to work on .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right . OK .\nPhD C: But {disfmarker} Mmm . Yeah . So I did {disfmarker} I just {pause} started to test {pause} putting together two VAD which was {disfmarker} was not much work actually . Um , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , {vocalsound} um , energy - based VAD {vocalsound} that , uh , the other Aurora guys use . Um . So , which is just putting a threshold on {pause} the noise energy ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and , detect detecting the first {pause} group of four frames {pause} that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , uh , from this point , uh , tagging the frames there as speech . So it removes {vocalsound} the first silent portion {disfmarker} portion of each utterance . And it really removes it , um , still o on the noises where {pause} our MLP VAD doesn't {pause} work a lot .\nProfessor B: Mmm .\nPhD C: Uh ,\nProfessor B: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral {pause} information ,\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: uh {disfmarker} uh , you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance {disfmarker} uh , would give you some {pause} better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or {disfmarker} or , uh {pause} stop consonants , or something like that .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nPhD C: Yeah . So , your point is {disfmarker} will be to u use whatever {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and {pause} nonspeech . And , um ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And {disfmarker} and most , um , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a {disfmarker} a high - pass kind of characteristic {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: an upward slope . So having some kind of a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: uh , you know , at the beginning of a {disfmarker} of a {disfmarker} of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it will tend to have this high - frequency component . Whereas , {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency . Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: it plus energy plus timing information is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of {pause} what they were using then .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: So , yeah . It {disfmarker} it might be that what I did is {disfmarker} so , removes like {vocalsound} low , um , {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} low - energy , uh , speech frames . Because {pause} the way I do it is I just {disfmarker} I just combine the two decisions {disfmarker} so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} with the and {pause} operator . So , I only {pause} keep the frames where the two agree {pause} that it 's speech . So if the energy - based dropped {disfmarker} dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are lost . Mmm .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But s still , the way it 's done right now it {disfmarker} it helps on {disfmarker} on the noises where {disfmarker} it seems to help on the noises where {vocalsound} our VAD was not very {pause} good .\nProfessor B: Well , I guess {disfmarker} I mean , one could imagine combining them in different ways . But {disfmarker} but , I guess what you 're saying is that the {disfmarker} the MLP - based one has the spectral information . So .\nPhD C: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done {disfmarker} Well , yeah .\nProfessor B: Well , you can imagine {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is {disfmarker} So , it {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Is {disfmarker} ?\nPhD C: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are {disfmarker} are , uh , dropped , even if the , um , MLP decides to keep them .\nProfessor B: Right . Right . And that might not be optimal ,\nPhD C: But , yeah .\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: No\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker} I mean , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , a probability estimated by each one and {disfmarker} and put them together .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mmm . M Yeah .\nPhD A: Something that {disfmarker} that I 've used in the past is , um {disfmarker} when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . And you {pause} make your decision when the derivative is increasing for {pause} so many frames . Then you say that 's beginning of speech .\nPhD C: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: But , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . I guess it depends on how you do it . But {pause} I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's been a useful thing .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it . I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: then only make a decision because {pause} you still need to smooth the {pause} decision further .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD G: So that 's always there .\nPhD A: Yeah . OK .\nPhD C: Well , actually if I don't {disfmarker} maybe don't want to work too much of {disfmarker} on it right now . I just wanted to {disfmarker} to see if it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what I observed was the re was caused by this {disfmarker} this VAD problem .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And it seems to be the case . Um . Uh , the second thing is the {disfmarker} this spectral subtraction . Um . Um , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , uh , {nonvocalsound} twenty - five experiments , uh , with different , uh , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use {pause} an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} noise than the noise spectra that {pause} is estimated {pause} on the noise portion of the s uh , the utterances . So I tried several , uh , over - estimation factors . And after subtraction , I also add {pause} a constant noise , and I also try different , uh , {vocalsound} noise , uh , values and we 'll see what happen .\nProfessor B: Hmm . OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . But st still when we look at the , um {disfmarker} Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . Um . On the other hand , when you {pause} subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but {pause} maybe you distort a lot of speech . So . Well . Mmm . Well , it {disfmarker} until now , it doesn't seem to help . But We 'll see . So the next thing , maybe I {disfmarker} what I will {pause} try to {disfmarker} to do is just {pause} to try to smooth mmm , {vocalsound} the , um {disfmarker} to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right . Mmm .\nPhD G: Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ?\nPhD C: Yeah . So , to get something that 's {disfmarker} would be closer to {pause} what you tried to do with Wiener filtering .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD G: Actually , it 's , uh {disfmarker} Uh . I don't know , it 's {disfmarker} go ahead .\nPhD C: It {disfmarker}\nPhD G: And it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Maybe you can {disfmarker}\nPhD G: go ahead .\nPhD C: I think it 's {disfmarker} That 's it for me .\nPhD G: OK . So , uh {disfmarker} u th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . And there are {disfmarker} there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was {disfmarker} I was assuming that always the VAD {disfmarker} uh , the initial frames were silence . It always started in the silence state , but it wasn't for some utterances . So the {disfmarker} it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So this is on SpeechDat - Car Italian ?\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: So , in some cases s there are also {disfmarker}\nPhD G: SpeechDat - Car Italian . Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are .\nPhD C: o Uh - huh .\nPhD G: So that was one of the {pause} bugs that was there in estimating the noise . And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with {pause} different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the {disfmarker} the trend seems to be like , {vocalsound} uh , smoothing the {pause} current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like {pause} deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the {disfmarker} estimating the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like {disfmarker} it 's still comparable to the baseline . I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . And , uh , so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So there are three time constants that I have . So , I 'm just playing around . So , one is fixed in the line , like {pause} Smoothing the clean speech is {disfmarker} is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying {disfmarker} trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that {disfmarker} if some {disfmarker} In some cases the clean speech is , like {disfmarker} when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't {pause} vary a lot in the low - energy regions . And , uh . So . The results are , like {disfmarker} So far I 've been testing only with the {pause} baseline , which is {disfmarker} which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . I just want to separate the {disfmarker} the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , uh , just the spectral {disfmarker} I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . Um . And the other thing that I tried was {disfmarker} but I just {vocalsound} took of those , uh , {pause} {vocalsound} Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a {disfmarker} a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And it 's {disfmarker} it seems to be like it 's not {vocalsound} hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a {pause} four hertz {disfmarker} a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had . And so {disfmarker} Yeah . Just {disfmarker} just to see whether it really {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} is it worth trying or not . So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that . So there must be something that I can {disfmarker} that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess I would ask Carlos about that . I mean , how {disfmarker} how he derived those filters and {disfmarker} and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which {disfmarker} what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: This is cubic root of power spectra ?\nPhD G: Yeah . Cubic root of power spectrum .\nProfessor B: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . Right ?\nPhD G: Yeah . And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: So it has , like {disfmarker} the spectrogram has , like {disfmarker} Uh , it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's {disfmarker} there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So , those are the regions where there are , like {disfmarker} when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So . That 's {pause} something I observe using that filter . And {disfmarker} Yeah . There are a few {disfmarker} very {disfmarker} not a lot of {disfmarker} because the filter doesn't have a {disfmarker} really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ? OK ?\nProfessor B: OK . Why don't we read some digits ?\nPhD A: Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ?\nProfessor B: Sure .\nPhD A: Transcript L dash two one five .\nProfessor B: O K .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about echoes and reverberation?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the professor think about echoes and reverberation?", "context": "Professor B: I think for two years we were two months , uh , away from being done .\nPhD A: And what was that , Morgan ? What project ?\nProfessor B: Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .\nPhD A: Oh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . We were two {disfmarker} we were {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh , uh , we went through it {disfmarker} Jim and I went through old emails at one point and {disfmarker} and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're two months away from being done . It was very {disfmarker} very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and {disfmarker} with the schedules {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}\nPhD A: It was true for two years .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true .\nPhD A: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we {pause} go around and do , uh , status report {pause} kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So .\nProfessor B: Yeah . So we {pause} probably should wait for him to come before we do his .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: OK . That 's a good idea .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Any objection ? Do y OK , M\nProfessor B: All in favor\nPhD A: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B: Uh , I don't do anything . I {disfmarker} No , I mean , I {disfmarker} I 'm involved in discussions with {disfmarker} with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're {disfmarker} since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .\nGrad F: OK . So should I go so that , uh ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?\nGrad F: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad F: OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my {disfmarker} my proposal . So , um {disfmarker} Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh {disfmarker} on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a {disfmarker} as a middle step . And , um , I hope to {disfmarker} hope to get this , um {disfmarker} a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .\nPhD A: When is your , uh , meeting ?\nGrad F: Um , my meeting\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: with , uh {disfmarker} ? Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for that {disfmarker} for that part I would {disfmarker} I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for {disfmarker} for Switchboard . And I 'd run some {disfmarker} some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers .\nPhD A: Oh . So that 's why you were interested in getting your own features into the SRI files .\nGrad F: Yeah . That 's why I {disfmarker} I was asking about that .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah . Um , and I guess that 's {disfmarker} that 's it . Any {disfmarker} any questions ?\nPhD A: Sounds good . So you just have a few more weeks , huh ?\nGrad F: Um , yeah . A few more .\nPhD A: It 's about a month from now ?\nGrad F: It 's a {disfmarker} it 's a month and {disfmarker} and a week .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , uh , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we {disfmarker} we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , {vocalsound} six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um , {vocalsound} considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK {disfmarker} sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't . Um , so this , um {disfmarker} This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel {pause} normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the {disfmarker} Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts {pause} in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have {pause} different phones {pause} lined up with a different foreground phone , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} depending on {pause} the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um {disfmarker} Hmm .\nProfessor B: I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about {disfmarker} we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that {disfmarker} some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy {pause} sections ? Um , uh , if you {disfmarker} if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in {pause} late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a {disfmarker} an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what {disfmarker} what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero {disfmarker} set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a {disfmarker} a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in {disfmarker} So in this case you have some artificially imposed {pause} reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did {disfmarker} ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the {disfmarker} the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some {disfmarker} some , uh , very low or {disfmarker} or near zero {pause} value . I mean , uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that {disfmarker} that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: or pre - echoes , whichever they are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Be pretty simple . I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to {pause} keep in an echo than to throw out speech .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD G: Um , what is the reverberation time {pause} like {pause} there ?\nGrad E: In thi in this room ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD G: On , uh , the {disfmarker} the one what {disfmarker} the s in the speech that you are {disfmarker} you are using like ?\nGrad E: Y Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know .\nProfessor B: So , it 's this room .\nPhD G: It 's , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: It 's {disfmarker} it 's this room .\nPhD G: Oh , this room ?\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: so it 's {disfmarker} these are just microphone {disfmarker} this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on .\nGrad F: Oh .\nProfessor B: Uh , we should do a measurement in here . I g think we never have . I think it 's {disfmarker} I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T\nGrad F: Hmm !\nProfessor B: something like that ? But it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's this room .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD G: OK . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh . But the other thing is , he 's putting in {disfmarker} w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways . He 's also putting in , uh , a {disfmarker} he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has {pause} averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be {disfmarker} you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't . And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away . Uh , and if it 's a low {pause} energy compo portion , you might actually hear some {pause} funny things .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nGrad E: O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is {pause} just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I don't see why {disfmarker} why your signal is louder after processing , because yo\nGrad E: Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah . I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have {pause} better signal - to - noise ratio .\nPhD C: Well , well {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But just it being bigger if {disfmarker} with the same signal - to - noise ratio {disfmarker}\nGrad E: It w i i it wouldn't affect things .\nProfessor B: No .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: Well , the system is {disfmarker} use {pause} the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on {disfmarker} on the {pause} signal level . But , not so much , I guess .\nProfessor B: Well , yeah . But it 's trained and tested on the same thing .\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor B: So if the {disfmarker} if the {disfmarker} if you change {vocalsound} in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD A: Did you add {pause} this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ?\nGrad E: Uh {disfmarker} Um . Did I w what ?\nPhD A: Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect .\nGrad E: Sorry ? Yeah .\nPhD A: But I {disfmarker} I was {pause} sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I b\nPhD A: You didn't {pause} train it also .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} Right . I trained on clean TI - digits . I {disfmarker} I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits . But I didn't {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder .\nProfessor B: Oh , I see .\nGrad E: I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder .\nProfessor B: OK . Well , I don't understand then . Yeah .\nGrad E: Huh . I don't know . If it 's {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} like , if it 's trying to find a {disfmarker} a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter . And then if you take it out {disfmarker} that taking it out makes things louder . I mean .\nProfessor B: Uh , no . I mean , {vocalsound} uh , there 's {disfmarker} there 's nothing inherent about removing {disfmarker} if you 're really removing ,\nGrad E: Nuh - huh .\nProfessor B: uh , r uh , then I don't {pause} see how that would make it louder .\nGrad E: The mean . OK . Yeah , I see .\nProfessor B: So it might be just some {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . So I should maybe listen to that stuff again .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It might just be some artifact of the processing that {disfmarker} that , uh , if you 're {disfmarker} Uh , yeah . I don't know .\nGrad E: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: I wonder if there could be something like , uh {disfmarker} for s for the PZM data ,\nPhD C: Eh\nPhD A: uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . Uh . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um {disfmarker} you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it {disfmarker} it could cause {pause} you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , you know , there is this . Wait a minute . It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} i maybe {disfmarker} i If , um {disfmarker} Subtracting the {disfmarker} the mean log spectrum is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your {disfmarker} if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a {disfmarker} a question of {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . That 's something to think about .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: I had a question about the system {disfmarker} the SRI system . So , {vocalsound} you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on {pause} Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . Uh , but is it {pause} exactly the same system ?\nGrad E: Uh . I think so .\nPhD C: Hmm .\nGrad E: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , um , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um , like MLLR transformations also ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a {disfmarker} a result on testing on Macrophone or {disfmarker} or training ?\nPhD C: all that stuff .\nGrad E: That 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: It was {pause} training on Macrophone and testing {disfmarker} yeah , on {disfmarker} on meeting digits .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that was done already . So we were {disfmarker} Uh , and it 's point eight ? OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I 've just been text {comment} testing the new {pause} Aurora front - end with {disfmarker} well , Aurora system actually {disfmarker} so front - end and HTK , um , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . We have {disfmarker} I have two point seven percent error rate . And before with the system that was proposed , it 's what ? It was three point nine . So .\nProfessor B: Oh , that 's a lot better .\nPhD C: We are getting better .\nProfessor B: So , what {disfmarker} w ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: With the {disfmarker} with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ?\nPhD C: Yeah . Two point seven .\nPhD G: I know in the meeting , like {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the meeting we have two point seven .\nPhD G: Right . Oh .\nGrad F: That 's with the new IIR filters ?\nPhD C: Uh . Yeah , yeah . So , yeah ,\nGrad F: OK .\nPhD C: we have {pause} the new LDA filters , and {disfmarker} I think , maybe {disfmarker} I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation . Uh , eh {disfmarker} Do y did you have a look at {disfmarker} at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I didn't . No .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD G: No . The DC component could be negligible . I mean , if you are {pause} recording it through a mike . I mean , any {disfmarker} all of the mikes have the DC removal {disfmarker} some capacitor sitting right in {pause} that bias it .\nProfessor B: Yeah . But this {disfmarker} uh , uh , uh , no . Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold in the A - toD. And these period these typically do have a DC offset .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: And {disfmarker} and they can be surprisingly large . It depends on the electronics .\nPhD G: Oh , so it is the digital {disfmarker} OK . It 's the A - toD that introduces the DC in .\nProfessor B: Yeah . The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC .\nPhD G: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: typi you know , unless {disfmarker} Actually , there are {pause} instrumentation mikes that {disfmarker} that do pass {disfmarker} go down to DC . But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: uh , no , it 's the electronics . And they {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: then there 's amplification afterwards . And you can get , I think it was {disfmarker} I think it was in the {pause} Wall Street Journal data that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I can't remember , one of the DARPA things . There was this big DC - DC offset\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: we didn't {disfmarker} we didn't know about for a while , while we were {pause} messing with it . And we were getting these terrible results . And then we were talking to somebody and they said , \" Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ? Everybody knows that . There 's all this DC offset in th \" So , yes . You can have DC offset in the data .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD G: OK .\nPhD A: So was that {disfmarker} was that everything , Dave ?\nGrad E: Oh . And I also , um , did some experiments {pause} about normalizing the phase . Um . So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at . And , um , the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea , um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases . They {disfmarker} they add in this modulo two pi way and , um , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really {pause} mathematically correct . So , {vocalsound} what I did instead is I {vocalsound} took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase {pause} off to normalize . But that , um , didn't work either .\nProfessor B: See , we have a different interpretation of this . He says it doesn't work . I said , I think it works magnificently , but just not for the task we intended . Uh , it gets rid of the speech .\nPhD A: What does it leave ?\nGrad F: Uh , gets rid of the speech .\nProfessor B: Uh , it leaves {disfmarker} you know , it leaves the junk . I mean , I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's tremendous .\nGrad F: Oh , wow .\nProfessor B: You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something .\nPhD A: Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ?\nProfessor B: Ex - exactly . Yeah , you got it .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a general rule .\nPhD G: Oh , it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . Including what I just said .\nGrad E: And , yeah , that 's everything .\nPhD A: All set ? Do you want to go , Stephane ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . Maybe , concerning these d still , these meeting digits . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because {pause} this is also one big difference between {pause} the two systems . Um , the other differences were {pause} the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more {disfmarker} SRI system are more complex . But , uh , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and\nPhD A: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system .\nPhD C: it was hard t to {disfmarker} to have some exper some improvement with this . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , it sounds like they also have {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he 's saying they have all these , uh , uh , different kinds of adaptation .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: You know , they have channel adaptation . They have speaker adaptation .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right .\nPhD A: Well , there 's also the normalization .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Like they do , um {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits ,\nPhD C: The vocal tr\nPhD A: but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's , um {disfmarker} conversation - side normalization for the {pause} non - C - zero components ,\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . This is another difference . Their normalization works like on {disfmarker} on the utterance levels .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But we have to do it {disfmarker} We have a system that does it on - line .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: So , it might be {disfmarker} it might be better with {disfmarker} it might be worse if the {pause} channel is constant ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: or {disfmarker} Nnn .\nPhD G: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or {disfmarker} or is it the whole word ?\nPhD C: SRI {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's tr\nGrad F: SRI .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . I guess it 's triphones .\nPhD G: It 's triphone .\nProfessor B: I think it 's probably more than that .\nPhD C: Huh .\nProfessor B: I mean , so they {disfmarker} they have {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thin think they use these , uh , uh , genone things . So there 's {disfmarker} there 's these kind of , uh , uh , pooled models and {disfmarker} and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies .\nPhD G: Oh . It 's like the tied state .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: They have tied states and I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . But I think {disfmarker} I think they {disfmarker} they don't just have triphones .\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: I think they have a range of {disfmarker} of , uh , dependencies .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Yeah . Well . Um . Well , the first thing I {disfmarker} that I want to do is just maybe these gender things . Uh . And maybe see with {pause} Andreas if {disfmarker} Well , I {disfmarker} I don't know {pause} how much it helps , what 's the model .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ?\nPhD C: That 's right . So it 's the clean {pause} TI - digits training set .\nPhD A: So exact same training data ?\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I guess you used the clean training set .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: For {disfmarker} with the SRI system {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Well .\nGrad E: You know , the {disfmarker} the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , um , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , um , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . But I don't think there 's any other difference .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B: So is that {disfmarker} ? Uh , are {disfmarker} are these results comparable ? So you {disfmarker} you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent {pause} on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits {disfmarker} {comment} TI - digits . Right ? And {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ?\nPhD C: Yeah . I think so .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So it 's {pause} about the same ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: maybe a little worse .\nGrad E: W w it was one {disfmarker} one point two\nPhD C: Ye\nGrad E: with the SRI system ,\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The complete SRI system is one point two .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you were HTK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right ? OK . That 's right . So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK , so {pause} the comparable number then , uh {pause} for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the {pause} um , two point f\nPhD C: It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , uh , b\nGrad E: D d\nProfessor B: Oh , right , right , right , right .\nPhD C: MFCC features {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent .\nProfessor B: Right . Right , right , right .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: OK . Alright . So {disfmarker} He 's doing some {pause} different things .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker} Yeah . The only difference is the features , right now , between this and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yes . OK , good . So they are helping .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: That 's good to hear . Yeah .\nPhD C: They are helping . Yeah . Um . Yeah . And another thing I {disfmarker} I maybe would like to do is to {pause} just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone {disfmarker} test it on , uh , the noisy TI - digits ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: cuz I 'm still wondering {pause} where this {pause} improvement comes from . When you train on Macrophone , it seems better on meeting digits . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe {pause} Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than {disfmarker} than TI - digit is , which is {disfmarker} TI - digits are very {pause} clean recorded digits\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know , it would also be interesting to see , uh {disfmarker} to do the regular Aurora test ,\nPhD C: Uh , f s\nPhD A: um , but use the SRI system instead of HTK .\nPhD C: That 's {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's what {pause} I wanted , just , uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So , just using the SRI system , test it on {disfmarker} and test it on {pause} Aurora TI - digits . Right .\nPhD A: Why not the full Aurora , uh , test ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . There is this problem of multilinguality yet .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: So we don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: You 'd have to train the SRI system with {disfmarker} with all the different languages .\nPhD C: i i\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: We would have to train on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . That 's what I mean .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , like , comple\nProfessor B: It 'd be a {pause} lot of work . That 's the only thing .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well , I mean ,\nPhD C: Mmm .\nPhD A: uh , uh , I guess the work would be into getting the {disfmarker} the files in the right formats , or something . Right ? I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're , uh {disfmarker} you 're also training on all the data .\nPhD C: That 's right .\nPhD A: I mean , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . I see . Oh , so , OK . Right . I see what you mean .\nProfessor B: That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: because {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a good idea , but it seems like {pause} it makes sense to do some pruning\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: first with a {disfmarker} a test or two that makes sense for you ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then {pause} take the likely candidates and go further .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information {pause} about what 's going on . And {disfmarker} mm - hmm . Uh , yeah . OK . Uh , the next thing is this {disfmarker} this VAD problem that , um , um {disfmarker} So , I 'm just talking about the {disfmarker} the curves that I {disfmarker} I sent {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I sent you {disfmarker} so , whi that shows that {vocalsound} when the SNR decrease , {vocalsound} uh , the current {pause} VAD approach doesn't drop much frames {pause} for some particular noises , uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically .\nProfessor B: I i Just to clarify something for me . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So does any of this matter ? I mean , other than our interest in it . Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Uh {disfmarker} Well . First of all , the boundaries might be , uh {disfmarker} like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or {disfmarker} before and after speech . Uh . So removing more than that might still make {pause} a difference {pause} in the results .\nProfessor B: Do we {disfmarker} ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} No . Because we don't {disfmarker} didn't looked {pause} that much at that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: But , {vocalsound} still , I think it 's an interesting problem .\nProfessor B: Oh , yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when {disfmarker} when , uh , the gang gets back from Crete . Because {pause} there 's lots of interesting problems , of course .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: And then the thing is if {disfmarker} if they really are going to have some means of giving us {pause} fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue .\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Um But {vocalsound} I don't know .\nPhD G: Because w we were wondering whether that {pause} VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if {disfmarker} if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: to find a {disfmarker} I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more {pause} suitable for us .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't {pause} use that information anymore ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: So . We don't know what is the type of {pause} {vocalsound} {pause} VAD which they 're going to provide .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . And actually there 's {disfmarker} Yeah . There 's an {disfmarker} uh , I think it 's still for {disfmarker} even for the evaluation , uh , it might still be interesting to {vocalsound} work on this because {pause} the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , {vocalsound} um , starting of speech and end of speech {pause} uh , at the utterance level . And {disfmarker} Um .\nPhD G: With some {disfmarker} some gap .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that {disfmarker} whatever the hang - over time which they are talking .\nPhD C: Yeah . But when you have like , uh , five or six frames , both {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Yeah . Then the they will just fill {disfmarker} fill it up .\nPhD C: it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , th {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So if you could get at some of that , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: although that 'd be hard .\nPhD C: Yeah . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other {pause} things that we want to work on .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right . OK .\nPhD C: But {disfmarker} Mmm . Yeah . So I did {disfmarker} I just {pause} started to test {pause} putting together two VAD which was {disfmarker} was not much work actually . Um , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , {vocalsound} um , energy - based VAD {vocalsound} that , uh , the other Aurora guys use . Um . So , which is just putting a threshold on {pause} the noise energy ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and , detect detecting the first {pause} group of four frames {pause} that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , uh , from this point , uh , tagging the frames there as speech . So it removes {vocalsound} the first silent portion {disfmarker} portion of each utterance . And it really removes it , um , still o on the noises where {pause} our MLP VAD doesn't {pause} work a lot .\nProfessor B: Mmm .\nPhD C: Uh ,\nProfessor B: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral {pause} information ,\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: uh {disfmarker} uh , you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance {disfmarker} uh , would give you some {pause} better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or {disfmarker} or , uh {pause} stop consonants , or something like that .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nPhD C: Yeah . So , your point is {disfmarker} will be to u use whatever {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and {pause} nonspeech . And , um ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And {disfmarker} and most , um , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a {disfmarker} a high - pass kind of characteristic {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: an upward slope . So having some kind of a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: uh , you know , at the beginning of a {disfmarker} of a {disfmarker} of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it will tend to have this high - frequency component . Whereas , {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency . Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: it plus energy plus timing information is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of {pause} what they were using then .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: So , yeah . It {disfmarker} it might be that what I did is {disfmarker} so , removes like {vocalsound} low , um , {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} low - energy , uh , speech frames . Because {pause} the way I do it is I just {disfmarker} I just combine the two decisions {disfmarker} so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} with the and {pause} operator . So , I only {pause} keep the frames where the two agree {pause} that it 's speech . So if the energy - based dropped {disfmarker} dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are lost . Mmm .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But s still , the way it 's done right now it {disfmarker} it helps on {disfmarker} on the noises where {disfmarker} it seems to help on the noises where {vocalsound} our VAD was not very {pause} good .\nProfessor B: Well , I guess {disfmarker} I mean , one could imagine combining them in different ways . But {disfmarker} but , I guess what you 're saying is that the {disfmarker} the MLP - based one has the spectral information . So .\nPhD C: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done {disfmarker} Well , yeah .\nProfessor B: Well , you can imagine {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is {disfmarker} So , it {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Is {disfmarker} ?\nPhD C: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are {disfmarker} are , uh , dropped , even if the , um , MLP decides to keep them .\nProfessor B: Right . Right . And that might not be optimal ,\nPhD C: But , yeah .\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: No\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker} I mean , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , a probability estimated by each one and {disfmarker} and put them together .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mmm . M Yeah .\nPhD A: Something that {disfmarker} that I 've used in the past is , um {disfmarker} when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . And you {pause} make your decision when the derivative is increasing for {pause} so many frames . Then you say that 's beginning of speech .\nPhD C: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: But , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . I guess it depends on how you do it . But {pause} I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's been a useful thing .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it . I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: then only make a decision because {pause} you still need to smooth the {pause} decision further .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD G: So that 's always there .\nPhD A: Yeah . OK .\nPhD C: Well , actually if I don't {disfmarker} maybe don't want to work too much of {disfmarker} on it right now . I just wanted to {disfmarker} to see if it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what I observed was the re was caused by this {disfmarker} this VAD problem .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And it seems to be the case . Um . Uh , the second thing is the {disfmarker} this spectral subtraction . Um . Um , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , uh , {nonvocalsound} twenty - five experiments , uh , with different , uh , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use {pause} an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} noise than the noise spectra that {pause} is estimated {pause} on the noise portion of the s uh , the utterances . So I tried several , uh , over - estimation factors . And after subtraction , I also add {pause} a constant noise , and I also try different , uh , {vocalsound} noise , uh , values and we 'll see what happen .\nProfessor B: Hmm . OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . But st still when we look at the , um {disfmarker} Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . Um . On the other hand , when you {pause} subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but {pause} maybe you distort a lot of speech . So . Well . Mmm . Well , it {disfmarker} until now , it doesn't seem to help . But We 'll see . So the next thing , maybe I {disfmarker} what I will {pause} try to {disfmarker} to do is just {pause} to try to smooth mmm , {vocalsound} the , um {disfmarker} to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right . Mmm .\nPhD G: Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ?\nPhD C: Yeah . So , to get something that 's {disfmarker} would be closer to {pause} what you tried to do with Wiener filtering .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD G: Actually , it 's , uh {disfmarker} Uh . I don't know , it 's {disfmarker} go ahead .\nPhD C: It {disfmarker}\nPhD G: And it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Maybe you can {disfmarker}\nPhD G: go ahead .\nPhD C: I think it 's {disfmarker} That 's it for me .\nPhD G: OK . So , uh {disfmarker} u th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . And there are {disfmarker} there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was {disfmarker} I was assuming that always the VAD {disfmarker} uh , the initial frames were silence . It always started in the silence state , but it wasn't for some utterances . So the {disfmarker} it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So this is on SpeechDat - Car Italian ?\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: So , in some cases s there are also {disfmarker}\nPhD G: SpeechDat - Car Italian . Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are .\nPhD C: o Uh - huh .\nPhD G: So that was one of the {pause} bugs that was there in estimating the noise . And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with {pause} different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the {disfmarker} the trend seems to be like , {vocalsound} uh , smoothing the {pause} current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like {pause} deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the {disfmarker} estimating the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like {disfmarker} it 's still comparable to the baseline . I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . And , uh , so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So there are three time constants that I have . So , I 'm just playing around . So , one is fixed in the line , like {pause} Smoothing the clean speech is {disfmarker} is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying {disfmarker} trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that {disfmarker} if some {disfmarker} In some cases the clean speech is , like {disfmarker} when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't {pause} vary a lot in the low - energy regions . And , uh . So . The results are , like {disfmarker} So far I 've been testing only with the {pause} baseline , which is {disfmarker} which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . I just want to separate the {disfmarker} the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , uh , just the spectral {disfmarker} I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . Um . And the other thing that I tried was {disfmarker} but I just {vocalsound} took of those , uh , {pause} {vocalsound} Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a {disfmarker} a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And it 's {disfmarker} it seems to be like it 's not {vocalsound} hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a {pause} four hertz {disfmarker} a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had . And so {disfmarker} Yeah . Just {disfmarker} just to see whether it really {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} is it worth trying or not . So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that . So there must be something that I can {disfmarker} that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess I would ask Carlos about that . I mean , how {disfmarker} how he derived those filters and {disfmarker} and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which {disfmarker} what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: This is cubic root of power spectra ?\nPhD G: Yeah . Cubic root of power spectrum .\nProfessor B: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . Right ?\nPhD G: Yeah . And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: So it has , like {disfmarker} the spectrogram has , like {disfmarker} Uh , it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's {disfmarker} there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So , those are the regions where there are , like {disfmarker} when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So . That 's {pause} something I observe using that filter . And {disfmarker} Yeah . There are a few {disfmarker} very {disfmarker} not a lot of {disfmarker} because the filter doesn't have a {disfmarker} really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ? OK ?\nProfessor B: OK . Why don't we read some digits ?\nPhD A: Yep .

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: All set ? Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um {vocalsound} remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no {disfmarker} we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: it's just gonna be a television remote . {vocalsound} Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . {vocalsound} For reasons that I don't really know . There's {disfmarker} but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh {vocalsound} um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . {vocalsound} Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?\nProject Manager: Oh , right yeah .\nMarketing: Gotta plug you in .\nProject Manager: Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .\nIndustrial Designer: So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was {disfmarker} since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . Fair enough .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits\nMarketing: Fine .\nIndustrial Designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics\nIndustrial Designer: 'cause we were thinking {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white {disfmarker} like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: It needs , yeah .\nProject Manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .\nProject Manager: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the end of my presentation .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Great . Thank you very much Nathan . {vocalsound} Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S plug yourself in here . Mm . {vocalsound} Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Looks like you're in okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting .\nUser Interface: Th\nProject Manager: There you go . Sweet .\nMarketing: There you go .\nUser Interface: Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .\nProject Manager: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .\nUser Interface: Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um {vocalsound} now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well\nProject Manager: Oh yeah look at that .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . So\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: my personal preferences .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh {gap} .\nProject Manager: Great . Thanks for that Ron .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay\nMarketing: Does that mean I'm up ?\nProject Manager: yep that's you .\nMarketing: I think so . Okay .\nUser Interface: I can plug you in .\nMarketing: Oh that would be perfect . Thank you . Slide show up and running .\nProject Manager: Give it a little bit .\nMarketing: Or not . Uh . Oh there we go . Perfect . Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort {disfmarker} like watching a hundred people {vocalsound} use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . {vocalsound} And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their {disfmarker} the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . {vocalsound} Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . {vocalsound} So it's a good start for us .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um\nMarketing: Need to unplug this ?\nProject Manager: yep I'll just uh switch that back here .\nMarketing: Need it back .\nProject Manager: I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um {vocalsound} through you guys's presentations um {vocalsound} we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . {vocalsound} Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,\nMarketing: Oh right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics {vocalsound} um . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . So maybe this {disfmarker} we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um ,\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly .\nMarketing: Uh .\nProject Manager: Um so um . How {disfmarker} th this voice operation thing is {disfmarker} I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but we might be able to say um {vocalsound} volume up .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh . That could work . I like that .\nIndustrial Designer: With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep\nMarketing: Yeah . Something very basic .\nIndustrial Designer: and\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer: therefore be found .\nUser Interface: Sounds good .\nMarketing: Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah I think that's very doable .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a good point .\nProject Manager: If it's hidden under the couch {disfmarker} but then again you have this wee {disfmarker} this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too .\nUser Interface: A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: And you just say something to {disfmarker} into that\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and it\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: finds your {disfmarker}\nMarketing: K {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but {disfmarker} yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market .\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k\nMarketing: Making it just an option ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .\nMarketing: Yeah . Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I was thinking uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Are we still thinking about this screen {disfmarker} sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh go ahead .\nMarketing: Go ahead . The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: 'S definitely an option technically . I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not ,\nMarketing: Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface: they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point .\nMarketing: We're doing okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for .\nIndustrial Designer: Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: True . Worth looking into .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: True . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So it's just something to consider .\nProject Manager: Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I appear to have lost my microphone . Mm . {vocalsound} Right um we don't have many people {vocalsound} or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . Um right . I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um . The thing with {disfmarker} I see {vocalsound} would there not be a {vocalsound} we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct ,\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable .\nMarketing: Mm . Just the casing .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: We could have the casing , the the face plates .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Back to the uh the cost {disfmarker} the material . {vocalsound} We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? That's something I w for {disfmarker} say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: See if there {disfmarker} if there's even interest out there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .\nProject Manager: Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to {disfmarker} who all\nMarketing: Mm . Right .\nProject Manager: it's not like with cell phones like where you have a {disfmarker} you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: True . True . True .\nUser Interface: and most people have their televisions in the living room . Uh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright well we can {disfmarker} we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um .\nMarketing: Yeah . Oh yeah .\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um {vocalsound} yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?\nUser Interface: Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah okay . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Interface ?\nProject Manager: Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally {disfmarker} let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have {disfmarker} Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . {vocalsound} Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .\nMarketing: True . 'Cause it would have a docking base ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years {vocalsound} even with the touch screen ?\nProject Manager: Do they ? Okay .\nUser Interface: Those new ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Can we afford to include one of those ?\nMarketing: Can we afford that ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And will somebody buy it if we don't ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay so let's go with a um touch screen {vocalsound} with um some kind of {disfmarker} you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For twelve Euros ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple\nMarketing: It is . Fair enough .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you know so {disfmarker} you know . Well yeah I mean\nMarketing: The basics .\nProject Manager: you can put the {disfmarker} we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay so we'll {gap} touch screen and the battery , focus on um {vocalsound} uh presentation .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while {disfmarker} to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into {disfmarker} go into the next round of individual work on this .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .\nUser Interface: Be interesting .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And {gap} oh .\nIndustrial Designer: logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said .\nMarketing: Yeah the {vocalsound} the fashion\nUser Interface: We put fashion into electronics .\nMarketing: do . Yeah .\nProject Manager: W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .\nMarketing: Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I think perhaps {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S too much .\nProject Manager: good idea but yeah\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I think that that one m might just be um and they just {disfmarker} yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For now .\nProject Manager: a P_D_A_ would {disfmarker} they would {disfmarker} makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you guys think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .\nMarketing: Yeah . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: That'd be okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .\nMarketing: Um . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . True .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Jus\nMarketing: Yeah you would think .\nProject Manager: But apparently not .\nMarketing: But .\nProject Manager: So .\nIndustrial Designer: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .\nMarketing: If it comes from above .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: They just want it to be on and ready to go .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it {disfmarker} the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i\nUser Interface: Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .\nProject Manager: Oh\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode .\nUser Interface: Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . Sounds good .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nProject Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .\nUser Interface: I've put my files in the shared folder as well .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's fab guys . Cool .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group talk about the appearance of the television remote?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the group talk about the appearance of the television remote?", "context": "Project Manager: All set ? Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um {vocalsound} remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no {disfmarker} we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: it's just gonna be a television remote . {vocalsound} Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . {vocalsound} For reasons that I don't really know . There's {disfmarker} but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh {vocalsound} um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . {vocalsound} Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?\nProject Manager: Oh , right yeah .\nMarketing: Gotta plug you in .\nProject Manager: Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .\nIndustrial Designer: So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was {disfmarker} since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . Fair enough .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits\nMarketing: Fine .\nIndustrial Designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics\nIndustrial Designer: 'cause we were thinking {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white {disfmarker} like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: It needs , yeah .\nProject Manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .\nProject Manager: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the end of my presentation .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Great . Thank you very much Nathan . {vocalsound} Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: S plug yourself in here . Mm . {vocalsound} Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Looks like you're in okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting .\nUser Interface: Th\nProject Manager: There you go . Sweet .\nMarketing: There you go .\nUser Interface: Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .\nProject Manager: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .\nUser Interface: Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um {vocalsound} now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well\nProject Manager: Oh yeah look at that .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . So\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: my personal preferences .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh {gap} .\nProject Manager: Great . Thanks for that Ron .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay\nMarketing: Does that mean I'm up ?\nProject Manager: yep that's you .\nMarketing: I think so . Okay .\nUser Interface: I can plug you in .\nMarketing: Oh that would be perfect . Thank you . Slide show up and running .\nProject Manager: Give it a little bit .\nMarketing: Or not . Uh . Oh there we go . Perfect . Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort {disfmarker} like watching a hundred people {vocalsound} use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . {vocalsound} And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their {disfmarker} the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . {vocalsound} Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . {vocalsound} So it's a good start for us .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um\nMarketing: Need to unplug this ?\nProject Manager: yep I'll just uh switch that back here .\nMarketing: Need it back .\nProject Manager: I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um {vocalsound} through you guys's presentations um {vocalsound} we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . {vocalsound} Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,\nMarketing: Oh right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics {vocalsound} um . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . So maybe this {disfmarker} we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um ,\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly .\nMarketing: Uh .\nProject Manager: Um so um . How {disfmarker} th this voice operation thing is {disfmarker} I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but we might be able to say um {vocalsound} volume up .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh . That could work . I like that .\nIndustrial Designer: With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep\nMarketing: Yeah . Something very basic .\nIndustrial Designer: and\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer: therefore be found .\nUser Interface: Sounds good .\nMarketing: Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah I think that's very doable .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a good point .\nProject Manager: If it's hidden under the couch {disfmarker} but then again you have this wee {disfmarker} this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too .\nUser Interface: A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: And you just say something to {disfmarker} into that\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and it\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: finds your {disfmarker}\nMarketing: K {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but {disfmarker} yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market .\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k\nMarketing: Making it just an option ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .\nMarketing: Yeah . Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I was thinking uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Are we still thinking about this screen {disfmarker} sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh go ahead .\nMarketing: Go ahead . The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: 'S definitely an option technically . I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not ,\nMarketing: Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface: they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point .\nMarketing: We're doing okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for .\nIndustrial Designer: Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: True . Worth looking into .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: True . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So it's just something to consider .\nProject Manager: Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I appear to have lost my microphone . Mm . {vocalsound} Right um we don't have many people {vocalsound} or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . Um right . I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um . The thing with {disfmarker} I see {vocalsound} would there not be a {vocalsound} we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct ,\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable .\nMarketing: Mm . Just the casing .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: We could have the casing , the the face plates .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Back to the uh the cost {disfmarker} the material . {vocalsound} We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? That's something I w for {disfmarker} say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: See if there {disfmarker} if there's even interest out there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .\nProject Manager: Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to {disfmarker} who all\nMarketing: Mm . Right .\nProject Manager: it's not like with cell phones like where you have a {disfmarker} you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: True . True . True .\nUser Interface: and most people have their televisions in the living room . Uh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright well we can {disfmarker} we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um .\nMarketing: Yeah . Oh yeah .\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um {vocalsound} yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?\nUser Interface: Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah okay . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Interface ?\nProject Manager: Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally {disfmarker} let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have {disfmarker} Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . {vocalsound} Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .\nMarketing: True . 'Cause it would have a docking base ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years {vocalsound} even with the touch screen ?\nProject Manager: Do they ? Okay .\nUser Interface: Those new ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Can we afford to include one of those ?\nMarketing: Can we afford that ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And will somebody buy it if we don't ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay so let's go with a um touch screen {vocalsound} with um some kind of {disfmarker} you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For twelve Euros ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple\nMarketing: It is . Fair enough .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you know so {disfmarker} you know . Well yeah I mean\nMarketing: The basics .\nProject Manager: you can put the {disfmarker} we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay so we'll {gap} touch screen and the battery , focus on um {vocalsound} uh presentation .\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while {disfmarker} to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into {disfmarker} go into the next round of individual work on this .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .\nUser Interface: Be interesting .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And {gap} oh .\nIndustrial Designer: logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said .\nMarketing: Yeah the {vocalsound} the fashion\nUser Interface: We put fashion into electronics .\nMarketing: do . Yeah .\nProject Manager: W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .\nMarketing: Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I think perhaps {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'S too much .\nProject Manager: good idea but yeah\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I think that that one m might just be um and they just {disfmarker} yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For now .\nProject Manager: a P_D_A_ would {disfmarker} they would {disfmarker} makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you guys think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .\nMarketing: Yeah . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: That'd be okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .\nMarketing: Um . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . True .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Jus\nMarketing: Yeah you would think .\nProject Manager: But apparently not .\nMarketing: But .\nProject Manager: So .\nIndustrial Designer: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .\nMarketing: If it comes from above .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: They just want it to be on and ready to go .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it {disfmarker} the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i\nUser Interface: Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .\nProject Manager: Oh\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode .\nUser Interface: Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . Sounds good .\nMarketing: We're good ?\nProject Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .\nUser Interface: I've put my files in the shared folder as well .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's fab guys . Cool .", "answers": ["In terms of putting fashion into the electronics, this is both their slogan and their design target.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad A: OK , we 're on .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .  So . {vocalsound} The uh first was transcription status . Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ?\nPhD F: Um , sort of , I do , peripherally .\nPhD C: Is that English ?\nPhD F: Um {disfmarker} Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a {pause} week or week and a half ago\nPhD D: That 's our system .\nGrad A: Ugh !\nPhD F: and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that .\nGrad A: C can I have a pen ?\nPhD F: Um {disfmarker} Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings .\nPhD C: Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nPhD F: Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers\nPhD D: Speaking {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Which meetings is she transcribing ?\nPhD F: and {disfmarker} Um well we 've {disfmarker} we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: For IBM , yeah .\nPhD D: Hmm .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD F: and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .\nPhD D: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM\nGrad E: So we 're doing some in parallel .\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD F: No .\nGrad A: No , no .\nPhD F: Oh no no .\nGrad A: We haven't done that process .\nPhD D: no ?\nPhD F: No . We 're not waiting on them .\nGrad A: So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process .\nPhD D: Oh . Oh , OK .\nGrad E: So they 're just doing their own thing until {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Because I {disfmarker} I need to ask Jane whether it 's {disfmarker} it would be OK for her {disfmarker} um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions .\nPhD F: We 're doing it in parallel , yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: Um and we want it {disfmarker} You know , we need {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} Again , we {disfmarker} we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich\nGrad A: Right .\nPhD D: and get it transcribed and get it back . But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .\nGrad A: Yep , sounds familiar .\nPhD D: And so um I wanted to ask Jane if {disfmarker} if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could {disfmarker} could do {disfmarker} I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: um {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: There 's only two channels . So it 's only {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think .\nPhD D: It 's only two {disfmarker} Right , s\nPhD C: So .\nPhD D: Yeah . So {disfmarker} So it 's basically one channel to transcribe . And it 's {disfmarker} One session is only uh like seven {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So that should have ma many fewer {disfmarker} And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,\nPhD D: Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the {disfmarker} the thing that they 're reading\nProfessor B: right ? So . Yeah .\nPhD D: and they just may {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Make sure it 's right .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: And so um , um , I guess since she 's {disfmarker} I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I {disfmarker} maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah , well it certainly seems {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Uh if {disfmarker} if that 's OK with you to {disfmarker} to , you know , get that stuff uh {disfmarker} to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . OK , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Alrighty .\nPhD F: Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Can you mail that out to the list ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm , yeah I will . I {disfmarker} That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages\nGrad A: Oh , OK , OK .\nPhD F: and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .\nGrad A: Yeah , I haven't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: I 'll try to get to that . OK . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . I 'm just gonna do it . And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .\nProfessor B: You are going to {disfmarker}\nGrad A: I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to {pause} suggest edits . And then bleep them out .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad A: For the ones that we have . Um {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So but it 's just transcripts , not the {disfmarker} not the audio ?\nGrad A: Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also .\nPhD C: OK , yeah , yep . Ah .\nGrad A: I mean that 's my intention . Because the transcripts might not be right .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD F: So {disfmarker}\nGrad A: So you want people to be able to listen to them .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD F: So , um the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Oh , that 's a good point . That 's a good point . Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression .\nPhD F: Hmm . Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on\nGrad A: Well , that was the other point .\nPhD F: Oh , was that another one ?\nGrad A: Yep , that 's another agenda item .\nPhD F: OK . I 'll wait .\nGrad A: So , uh {disfmarker} But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . The back - end stuff is working out fine . It 's more or less ready to go . I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera and also by the user ID . So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well . Uh {disfmarker} The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy . So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and {disfmarker} and you and I can just talk about it off - line more .\nGrad E: Right .\nGrad A: But uh {pause} the back - end was pretty smooth .\nProfessor B: Oh\nGrad A: So I think , we 'll have something . It may not be as {disfmarker} As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something .\nProfessor B: I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point . He 's sort of been {disfmarker} been volunteering for everything\nGrad A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and {pause} and uh {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: O K . Finally said he was too busy . I guess we reached it .\nGrad A: Yeah , he {disfmarker} he actually {disfmarker} he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it . So . Oh well . Um {disfmarker}\nGrad E: And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display , and I don't know how much more we can do with it {disfmarker} with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom\nGrad A: Oh , cool .\nGrad E: so , right now it 's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know , it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it {disfmarker} think it has potential for a little something ,\nGrad A: For a demo ?\nGrad E: yeah , for a demo .\nGrad A: Yeah , sounds good .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: OK , so again , the issue is {disfmarker} For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on , but {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Oh . OK .\nGrad A: So it might just be slides .\nGrad E: Yeah , OK .\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nGrad E: Well , we 'll see , um {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . So hopefully that will work .\nPhD D: Really ? So is that {disfmarker} Because there 's some people um {disfmarker} It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at {disfmarker} at SRI\nPhD C: Yeah . Yep .\nPhD D: because the um {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack ,\nPhD D: we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah but {disfmarker} But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . It 's not on {disfmarker} on the web page anymore . But I just wrote an email to {disfmarker} to the author of {disfmarker} to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library\nGrad A: Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ?\nPhD C: and so it works . Yeah , but then you can't add our patches and then the {disfmarker} the new version is {disfmarker} is totally different\nGrad A: Oh .\nPhD C: a and in {disfmarker} yeah , in terms of {disfmarker} of the source code .\nGrad A: Ah .\nPhD C: You {disfmarker} you can't find the Tcl files anymore . It 's some whatever wrapped thing\nPhD D: Mmm .\nPhD C: and you can't {disfmarker} you can't access that so you have to install {disfmarker} First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then do the patches .\nGrad A: Patch . Ugh !\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I wonder if {disfmarker} if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad A: We have {disfmarker} Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet .\nPhD D: We have ? Oh . Oh , OK .\nPhD F: So did you um put the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page ? Or {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No , I haven't done that yet . I 'm {disfmarker} oh Nope . But I definitely will do that .\nProfessor B: So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . Just three different {disfmarker} It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I mean we could do it in Matl - {comment} I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure .\nPhD D: But {disfmarker} But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the {disfmarker} you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is {disfmarker} that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform .\nPhD C: Yep .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yes .\nGrad E: Yeah , that 'd be very cool .\nGrad A: It 'd be easy enough to add that . Again it 's {disfmarker} it 's {pause} It 's more Tcl - T\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad A: So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it ,\nPhD D: Right .\nGrad A: but uh , it wouldn't be hard to do .\nPhD D: Right . But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed .\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: S\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah , maybe we could l look into that .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad A: But it {disfmarker} it seems to me that I c\nPhD C: And {disfmarker}\nGrad A: It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary . So yo It seems to me you could do images .\nGrad E: Um {pause} What do you mean by real time ? Do you mean like {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad A: Yeah , jus Yeah .\nPhD F: Is that what you mean ?\nGrad A: It just seems to me jus\nGrad E: It would be cool to see it {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad E: It would be cool like to see {disfmarker} to hear it and see it ,\nPhD C: And to hear it . Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad E: and see the pitch contours also .\nGrad A: Sure , but I don't think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} You can do all that just statically in\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I think it would lose {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean y\nGrad A: Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Right , right . I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just {pause} like {pause} um view graphs or something .\nProfessor B: You know , wh Yeah . So . Uh , no , we 're talking about on the computer and {disfmarker} and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting ,\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor B: we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have and , {vocalsound} the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . So I think {disfmarker} {pause} For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so it 'd be a good thing to get in there . But , um {disfmarker} Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in {disfmarker} {pause} to people .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . So , we 're doing OK on backed up . We 're {disfmarker} We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . So , uh , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical , but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data {pause} all at once , in a lot of different ways .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD F: Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too .\nGrad A: Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers ,\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: An\nPhD F: Right .\nGrad A: so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . Um {disfmarker} And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . One of the things I was thinking is we {disfmarker} we just got these hundred {disfmarker} alright , excuse me {disfmarker} ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades .\nProfessor B: Did they come in ?\nPhD F: SUN - Blades .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD F: Yeah . They came in the other day .\nGrad A: They came in but they 're not set up yet .\nProfessor B: Oh .\nGrad A: And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those {pause} because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them .\nPhD F: Well , is there {disfmarker} Why not just hang them off of Abbott , is there a {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD F: Ah .\nProfessor B: Weren't we gonna get {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Ah , I see .\nProfessor B: Well , maybe it should get another rack .\nPhD D: But you still need to store the disks somehow .\nGrad A: Well , but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays .\nPhD D: So {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Just put them in .\nPhD F: You can put two {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Sure .\nPhD C: Internal . Yeah .\nGrad A: Yeah . Cuz the SUN {disfmarker} uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad A: So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nProfessor B: But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} file server {comment} it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something .\nPhD D: Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server .\nGrad A: Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions . What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ?\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: I see {vocalsound} {pause} Oh , I see .\nProfessor B: Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , mightn't you ? Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days ,\nGrad A: Oh , I didn't know he had left already .\nProfessor B: Uh , well , tonight .\nGrad A: Oh , oh well .\nPhD D: You mean he won't set up the {disfmarker} mmm .\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nGrad E: How much space do you need for these ?\nProfessor B: I don't know what his schedule is .\nGrad A: You {disfmarker} we need about a gig per meeting .\nProfessor B: I 'm just saying he 's gone .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD F: I {disfmarker} I thi\nGrad E: I have um {disfmarker} I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer .\nGrad A: Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ?\nGrad E: So {disfmarker} Uh , Samosa .\nProfessor B: You had an eighteen gigabyte drive .\nGrad E: Yeah , I had . Well it 's about {disfmarker} I think there 's about twelve gig left .\nGrad A: So it {disfmarker} And you have an X drives installed ? OK .\nGrad E: Yeah . So , I didn't realize it was so critical .\nGrad A: And you 're o you 're offering ?\nGrad E: I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are {disfmarker} new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything .\nGrad A: OK .\nGrad E: Um not that I can't do anything , I jus\nPhD F: I {disfmarker} I jus I just gave Thilo some {disfmarker} about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on {disfmarker} on uh Abbott . Uh {disfmarker} And uh {disfmarker} So but that {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Which one was that , X {pause} G ? X {pause} G ?\nPhD C: XG .\nPhD F: XG .\nGrad A: OK .\nPhD D: XG ?\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: That 's also where we store the {disfmarker} The uh Hub - five training set waveforms ,\nPhD C: Oops .\nGrad A: But that won't be getting any bigger ,\nPhD D: right ?\nPhD F: No .\nGrad A: will it ?\nPhD F: I don't think that 's on XG .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD F: On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD D: But I 've also been storing {disfmarker} I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are\nGrad E: Well {disfmarker}\nPhD D: and we won't be using the old ones anymore .\nGrad E: I have a lot of space , though .\nPhD F: Yeah , I do I don't think it was on XG .\nPhD D: Uh {disfmarker} Oh thats XA {disfmarker} Oh that 's X {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Isn't that XH ?\nPhD F: I th\nGrad A: Not {disfmarker} not for long .\nGrad E: I have a lot of space and it 's not {disfmarker} it 's n There 's very little uh {disfmarker} Yeah not for long .\nPhD D: Maybe I 'm confu\nGrad E: But I mean it 's not going f\nPhD D: Oh no I 'm sorry .\nGrad E: It 's not being used often at all .\nPhD C: But I 'm using XH {disfmarker} H , too .\nGrad A: Yeah , it 's probably {disfmarker} Probably only about four gig is on X {disfmarker} on your X drive ,\nPhD C: So .\nPhD D: Oh OK .\nGrad A: but we 'll definitely take it up if you {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I th\nPhD D: I think you 're right . It 's XH and D {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I think it 's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there ,\nPhD D: The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused .\nGrad E: three or four meetings .\nPhD D: OK .\nGrad A: Great .\nGrad E: So .\nGrad A: OK , so that will get us through the next couple days .\nProfessor B: We need {disfmarker} We need another gigaquad .\nGrad A: Yep . At least .\nProfessor B: There should {disfmarker} I d There should just be a b I should have a button .\nGrad A: The \" more disk space \" button ?\nProfessor B: Just press {disfmarker} Press each meeting saying \" we need more disk space \" {vocalsound} \" this week \" .\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: Skip the rest of the conversation .\nPhD F: Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings .\nProfessor B: And {disfmarker} And how much does each meeting take ?\nPhD F: And it 's about a gig uncompressed .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} It 's a little bit more as I usually don't {disfmarker} do not uncompress the {disfmarker} all of the PZM and the PDA things .\nPhD F: Is a little more ?\nPhD C: So .\nPhD F: Right , yeah so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} Yeah . One point five or something .\nPhD F: U Uh compressed how much are they ? Like {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Half a gig . For all of them .\nPhD F: About half ?\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Yep .\nPhD F: So we 're definitely are storing you know , all of those . So there 's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far ?\nProfessor B: So - so So maybe there 's a hundred {pause} gig or something . Or {disfmarker} I mean . Cuz we {disfmarker} we have the uncompressed around also .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm . Right .\nProfessor B: So it 's like {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD F: Right . Well we {disfmarker} We haven't uncompressed all the meetings , but {disfmarker}\nGrad A: I would like to .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well I mean it 's {disfmarker} the they really are cheap . I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD F: Right .\nProfessor B: but But uh , we could {disfmarker} You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's small {disfmarker} I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars .\nPhD F: Yeah . Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for {disfmarker} if we could get some disk .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD F: I s I sent this out a {disfmarker} a day ago\nGrad A: And put it where ?\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD F: but {disfmarker} and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works . I mean does he just go out and get them and {disfmarker} if it 's OK , and {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD F: So I was assuming he was gonna take over {pause} that . But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . And just {vocalsound} say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . And in my answer back was \" are you sure you just want one ? \" So I mean I think {pause} that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure \" well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months \" .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: Wa - a I know what they want . The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . So they don't want to stack up external drives .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um {disfmarker} {pause} And then they want everything else in the machine room .\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad A: So the question is where are you gonna hang them ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm . I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room .\nGrad A: Right .\nPhD F: So .\nProfessor B: Right . So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave ,\nPhD D: Th - The {disfmarker}\nPhD F: I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the {disfmarker} the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now .\nProfessor B: cuz it {disfmarker}\nPhD D: One {disfmarker} Mmm .\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD D: One {disfmarker} One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is\nPhD F: So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff .\nPhD D: I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and {disfmarker} and you know recover the space .\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: Yeah . No . I think Dave {disfmarker} Dave knows all these things , of course . An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time .\nPhD D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: But I {disfmarker} I know that {pause} generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back {disfmarker} the {pause} back up system , rather than on new disk .\nPhD D: Mmm . Mmm .\nGrad A: So . Which {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well . So . But this {disfmarker} this is a very specific question for me . Basically , we can easily get {pause} one to four disks , I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal . Uh , but the question is where they go , and I don't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him .\nPhD D: Maybe we can put some disks in the {disfmarker} in that back room there .\nGrad A: Yeah really .\nProfessor B: Attach to {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Popcorn .\nProfessor B: Yeah ?\nPhD D: To the machine that collects the data . So then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there .\nGrad A: Yeah , it 's just {disfmarker} It 's not on the net , so it 's a little {pause} awkward\nPhD D: The only {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Hmm .\nPhD D: What do you mean it 's not on the net ?\nGrad A: It 's not {disfmarker}\nPhD C: It 's not bad .\nGrad A: It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S\nPhD D: Oh because it 's {disfmarker} because it 's an ACIRI machine ?\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Oh , oh oh .\nGrad A: And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net , but Who knows when that will happen ?\nPhD D: But that can't be that hard .\nPhD F: That might be a good short term solution , though .\nPhD D: I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad A: No , the {disfmarker} the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room {pause} that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers .\nPhD D: Oh ,\nGrad A: So , they actually have to run a wire somewhere .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal . If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} jus every ever everybody {disfmarker} everybody has a {disfmarker} has {disfmarker}\nGrad A: But Dave has to do all of them .\nProfessor B: Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing . But at any rate I think that there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need and I think we need a {disfmarker} a conversation with {disfmarker} Uh , maybe {disfmarker} maybe after {disfmarker} after tea or something you and I can go down and {disfmarker} and talk to him about it Just say \" wha you know , what should we do right now ? \"\nPhD F: How long is David gonna be gone ?\nProfessor B: Uh , eleven days or something ?\nGrad A: Oh my !\nProfessor B: Yeah basically tomorrow and all of {pause} the week after .\nGrad A: And that 's all I have .\nProfessor B: Um {disfmarker} Let 's see . The only oth thing {disfmarker} other thing I was gonna add was that um {disfmarker} uh , I talked briefly to Mari and uh we had {vocalsound} both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the {pause} last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . And I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wanna do next meeting is {disfmarker} is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . I mean just sort of bulletize I mean o e do do I can {disfmarker} I can dream up text but {pause} this is basically gonna lead to the annual report . So {pause} Um {disfmarker} If w\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: This is the fifteenth ? So just a week from tomorrow ?\nProfessor B: Um , that would\nGrad A: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . So , uh , we can {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} So that 's an {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Is this gotta be in the morning ?\nProfessor B: Um {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Or {disfmarker} Because you know I {disfmarker} Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two . So if it could be before that would be be\nProfessor B: No , no but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't need other folks for the meeting . I can do it . A A All I 'm saying is that on {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Oh , OK , alright . Oh I 'm sorry , I misunderstood .\nProfessor B: Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting {pause} if I wa something I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her .\nPhD D: I thought you are {disfmarker} OK . Alright . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I think I have a pretty good idea\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker} but um {disfmarker} Uh , and then the next day uh , late in the day I 'll be having that {disfmarker} that discussion with her .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nProfessor B: Um . So .\nPhD D: Um {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} One thing {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} in past meetings we had um also a you know various {disfmarker} variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the {disfmarker} on the recognition side\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: um but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically . So . Um . And I wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting and between you know , whoever 's interested in that because I feel that uh there 's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Think so ?\nPhD D: Well , it 's that {disfmarker} It 's just gonna be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system .\nGrad A: I 'm interested .\nProfessor B: Well , OK , so how many {disfmarker} how many people here would not be interested in uh {disfmarker} in a meeting about recognition ?\nPhD C: Me too .\nPhD F: Jane may not be .\nGrad A: Jane , I think .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: Well I know {disfmarker} Well , Jane an Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this {disfmarker}\nGrad A: No . If we talked about it in this meeting .\nPhD F: He 's wondering how much overlap there will be .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so you 're su\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD D: So , uh , uh , Liz and Jane probably .\nProfessor B: OK , so we 're gonna have a guy 's meeting .\nPhD D: Uh . {vocalsound} Uh , if you wanna put it that way .\nPhD F: Good thing Liz isn't here .\nProfessor B: Real {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Watch a ball game ?\nProfessor B: Yeah , real {disfmarker} real {disfmarker} real men {vocalsound} \" Real men do decoding \" or something like that .\nPhD F: Don't listen to this , Liz .\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nPhD D: I mean it it 's sort of {disfmarker} I mean when {disfmarker} when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I 'm bored .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: The {disfmarker} Nod off ?\nPhD D: So it 's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to {disfmarker} i to {disfmarker} to be uh {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} I cou you know {disfmarker} this could {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: It 's cuz {pause} y you have a {disfmarker} So you need a better developed feminine side .\nPhD D: I 'm\nProfessor B: There 's probably gonna be a lot of \" bleeps \" in this meeting .\nPhD D: not sure I wanna {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Yeah , I would as {comment} I would guess .\nProfessor B: Uh . Um .\nPhD D: Yeah and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: I think it must be {pause} uh nearing the end of the week . Um . {vocalsound} Yeah . I {disfmarker} You know , I {disfmarker} I 've heard some comments about like this . That m could be .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I mean the {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} U\nPhD D: And we don't have to do it every week .\nPhD F: Could we {disfmarker}\nPhD D: We could do it every other week or so . You know , whatev or whenever we feel like we {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Right , I was {disfmarker} Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ?\nGrad A: Or just alternate the focus .\nPhD F: Tha - That 's what I mean .\nGrad A: Yeah , so on even weeks have {pause} basic {pause} on data .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: We could do that , yeah .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Personally I 'd {disfmarker} I 'm not in favor of more meetings . Um . {vocalsound} Because , uh .\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad A: I am .\nPhD D: You know .\nGrad A: Oh sor\nPhD F: But I do I don't {disfmarker} I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder .\nPhD D: Right .\nGrad A: Well , except that we keep going for our full time .\nPhD F: So if we did that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD F: Well , cuz we get into these other topics .\nGrad A: Yeah .\nPhD D: We feel {disfmarker} We feel obligated to collect more data .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad A: Ugh .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: I don't .\nPhD F: So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Let 's read digits and go .\nProfessor B: Why don't we just start with that .\nPhD D: ummh . {comment} ummh . {comment} OK .\nProfessor B: And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But I {disfmarker} I think that 's a great idea . Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane {pause} when we get a chance , see what they think and {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: Yeah that would be good . I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd {disfmarker} you know , where do we go from here kind of things and {disfmarker} So , it would be good .\nProfessor B: Yeah , and you 're {disfmarker} you 're attending {pause} the uh {disfmarker} the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have {disfmarker} you have probably one of the best {disfmarker} you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two .\nGrad A: Bridge .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: We are doing recognition in both of them . So .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nGrad A: OK ?\nPhD D: So um . So {disfmarker} so we could talk a little bit about that now if {disfmarker} if there 's some time .\nGrad A: No , no that would be for next week .\nPhD D: Um I jus So the latest result was that um um yot I tested the uh {disfmarker} the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for {disfmarker} for this year 's Hub - five test set .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the {disfmarker} you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end .\nGrad A: Mmm .\nPhD F: For both females and males ?\nPhD D: Yes . Uh , well i there was a little bit of a {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Oh !\nPhD D: i overall . They {disfmarker} They were {disfmarker} The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: I mean definitely not significant .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: And then the really nice thing was that if {disfmarker} if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .\nGrad A: Wow . Just with ROVER ?\nPhD D: So . t With N - best ROVER , which is like our {vocalsound} new and improved version of ROVER .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems {pause} to {pause} mmm , uh {pause} c combine that .\nProfessor B: So except {disfmarker} I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD D: And , the {disfmarker}\nPhD F: But a percent and a half ?\nGrad A: Yeah , it 's pretty {pause} impressive .\nPhD F: That 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: And {disfmarker} And so uh after I told the {disfmarker} my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a {disfmarker} Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination . Um , and , you know , why not ?\nProfessor B: Sure , why not ?\nPhD D: Uh . {vocalsound} So .\nGrad A: We clearly gotta add a few more features , though .\nPhD D: Uh w what do you mean ? More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ?\nGrad A: No , uh front - end features . You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra . Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Oh I mean {disfmarker} Yeah . Well Right . So , we cou Yeah . That 's {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} There 's one thing uh {disfmarker} I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end {disfmarker} You know , if you {disfmarker} you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems\nPhD F: Oh .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: and {disfmarker} Um . So . So one {disfmarker} one compromise would be to {disfmarker} only to have the {disfmarker} everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing .\nProfessor B: Mmm . An\nPhD D: So .\nPhD F: Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I think so . Yeah . Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if {disfmarker} You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: So . Um {pause} Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely .\nGrad A: Cool .\nPhD D: And then we had some results on {pause} digits , uh , with um {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} So this was uh really {comment} {disfmarker} really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: And so , uh . But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD D: And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor B: Including digits I gather , yeah .\nPhD D: And you c And {disfmarker} Not all of {disfmarker} No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it .\nProfessor B: A fifth of it is how much ?\nPhD D: The rest is {disfmarker} is read {disfmarker} is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that .\nProfessor B: Right . But a fi a fifth is how much ?\nPhD D: A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the {pause} amount of training that there was .\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD D: But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there\nProfessor B: Oh yeah\nPhD D: because we 're doing {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: w\nPhD D: You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT {disfmarker} {comment} uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: which is only what two hours something ?\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad A: I don't know .\nPhD D: So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps . And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .\nProfessor B: Yeah that was the interesting thing .\nPhD D: That 's e\nProfessor B: Because {disfmarker} because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better ,\nPhD D: That was e Right , right .\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker} but uh .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD F: Well is there even more read speech data around ?\nPhD D: Oh , yeah . So we only {disfmarker} for the Hub - five training , we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone {pause} database .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better .\nGrad A: I could also put in {pause} uh focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Right . Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data . I mean , Wall Street Journal , {pause} uh , take one example .\nGrad A: Yeah . That 's right .\nPhD D: But um . So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the {disfmarker} the digit recognizers to {disfmarker} to use uh something other than TI - digits .\nGrad A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Well they been using TIMIT .\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: That {disfmarker} Uh . {pause} They {disfmarker} they uh {disfmarker} they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and {disfmarker} and uh , um , {disfmarker} and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT .\nGrad A: Hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh {disfmarker} But uh {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} So that 's what they 're {disfmarker} they 're using now .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but yeah certainly if we , um {disfmarker} If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Once we know , then {disfmarker} the trainable parts of it {disfmarker} it 'd be great to run lots of {disfmarker} lots of stuff through .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Right . Well , that was that . And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system and {disfmarker} You wanna {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You wanna see where that stands ?\nPhD F: Well , I 'm {disfmarker}\nPhD D: \nPhD F: Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses . And so I 'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with . And uh so then I 'll train the net . And .\nPhD D: An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's {disfmarker} um that the phone set would change . So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Right . Eight .\nPhD D: forty - eight phones ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that {disfmarker} that we 've been using so far .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that will probably help , actually ,\nPhD F: So it 's a little different ?\nPhD D: because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the {disfmarker} as far as just the um , um {disfmarker} Just {disfmarker} You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features . And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three . And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the {pause} phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .\nProfessor B: Sure . Although we {disfmarker} I mean , it 's not that many fewer and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and we take a KLT anyway so we could {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . Exactly .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: So {disfmarker} so that was the other thing . And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end . So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .\nProfessor B: Yeah , and I think {disfmarker} and we sh again check {disfmarker} we should check with Stephane . My impression was that when we did that before that had very little {disfmarker} uh he didn't lose very much .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD F: By just taking the top whatever ?\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: Yeah yeah .\nPhD D: But then {disfmarker} And then something {disfmarker} Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system .\nProfessor B: And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system .\nPhD D: Exactly .\nPhD F: Right .\nPhD D: Yeah . So that would basically give us a , um , more {disfmarker} hopefully a {disfmarker} a better system\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: um because {disfmarker} you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard or s uh and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: But he {disfmarker} I think he d he didn't {disfmarker} he probably didn't use all the training data that was available . And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as {disfmarker} as the {disfmarker} as ours is .\nProfessor B: That 's {disfmarker} That 's certainly one thing , yeah .\nPhD D: So .\nProfessor B: Uh . Yeah .\nPhD D: And the dictionary made a huge difference . Uh . We {disfmarker} we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh {disfmarker} to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a {disfmarker} uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard , which {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well the other thing is , dipping {pause} deep into history and into uh our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Mmm .\nProfessor B: uh it was {disfmarker} I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , uh {pause} at the time .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh . {pause} And . Later we got away from it because {disfmarker} because once we had decent systems going then it was {disfmarker} it was typically better to use our own systems\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: cuz they were self consistent but {disfmarker} but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate . Uh . {vocalsound} But that was a {disfmarker} that was a good {disfmarker} good {disfmarker} good way to start .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: And we 're not quite that bad with our {disfmarker} our Switchboard systems but it was {disfmarker} they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's ,\nPhD D: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: so {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD F: W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ? Roughly ?\nProfessor B: Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent {pause} error . And uh it was {disfmarker} I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for . We never did really fix up the dictionary . Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and {disfmarker} and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did .\nPhD D: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor B: Uh , we never did an never did any adaptation\nPhD D: But that w Even that {disfmarker} that number {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: uh , we never did any {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . And {disfmarker} And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data , right ? Where the error rate now is in the twenties .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: So , um .\nProfessor B: So we were {disfmarker} Yeah . We were probably at least a factor or two off .\nPhD D: That 's yet s Right .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: So it would be {disfmarker} So it would be good t to sort of r re uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do .\nProfessor B: Yeah . But I think {disfmarker} again it 's {disfmarker} Yeah . It 's the conver it 's the s conversational speech bit . Because our {disfmarker} our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: He knows .\nPhD D: Right . And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up . Right ? Because it 's a pretty good um indicator of that .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs {pause} before we go ahead and train up the {disfmarker} uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It 'll still probably be worse . I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be context independent and so on .\nPhD D: No . Sure . Not {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Should we {disfmarker} Should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training ?\nProfessor B: But .\nPhD D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD F: I mean should {disfmarker} should we even use that ?\nPhD D: Oh {pause} oh that 's a good question .\nPhD F: Or should I just go straight to {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah , we {disfmarker} we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign .\nGrad A: Try it . You run it ? Keep {disfmarker} keep both versions ? See which one 's better ?\nProfessor B: Uh , yeah . I mean . I think I agree with Ad I mean basically you would then {disfmarker} You proceed with the embedded training .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: It 's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Right .\nProfessor B: And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did .\nPhD D: OK . Alright .\nPhD F: Mmm .\nGrad A: I could make arguments either way . You know , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: But {disfmarker} But so I {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Sort of given up guessing .\nPhD D: Well but i But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got\nProfessor B: Uh well . It depended on the task . I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: because we 're coming from uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system .\nPhD D: That are from another {disfmarker} Right .\nGrad A: Although , I mean we 've done it with {disfmarker} When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse .\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nGrad A: Which I 've never figured out .\nProfessor B: Right . But I mean i\nGrad A: I think it 's a bug .\nPhD D: So you {disfmarker} you started training with outputs from a {disfmarker} with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ?\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD D: And then {disfmarker} Uh .\nGrad A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Hmm . Well , that might probably just {disfmarker} Hmm . That was probably because your initial system {disfmarker} I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge 's . And you {disfmarker} Um .\nProfessor B: Was it ? I don't think it was .\nGrad A: No they were {disfmarker} they were comparable .\nPhD D: It wasn't ?\nProfessor B: No .\nGrad A: They were very close .\nPhD D: Really ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: That 's weird .\nProfessor B: Excuse me ?\nPhD D: That 's {disfmarker} That 's weird .\nGrad A: That 's what I said .\nProfessor B: Oh !\nPhD D: No I mean it 's weird that it did {disfmarker} I 'm sorry . It 's w It 's weird that it got worse .\nPhD F: That 's ambiguous .\nProfessor B: Um . No . Uh . Tha - u we we 've see I mean {disfmarker} and wi with the numbers {disfmarker} OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better .\nPhD D: Oh actually it 's not that weird because we have seen {disfmarker} We have seen cases where acoustic {disfmarker} retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It just {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: But I But I would {disfmarker} I would suspect that something that {disfmarker} that had um a very different Um feature set , for instance {disfmarker} I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us .\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: I {disfmarker} I would expect that something that had a different feature set would {disfmarker} would uh benefit from {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: What about uh hidden unit size {pause} on this .\nProfessor B: Oh , wait a minute , and the other thing uh ,\nPhD F: Oh .\nProfessor B: sorry , it was {disfmarker} the other thing is that what was in common {comment} to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors .\nGrad A: Right . Ah yeah .\nProfessor B: So I mean , uh , that 's another pretty big difference\nGrad A: That 's another big difference .\nProfessor B: and uh , one bac at least {disfmarker} Back at {disfmarker}\nPhD D: You mean with soft targets ? Or {disfmarker} ? Sorry , I 'm sor I missed {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} What 's the key issue here ?\nProfessor B: Oh , that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were {disfmarker} were training {pause} posteriors . And if we 're {disfmarker} we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . So {disfmarker} so that 's another difference .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different {disfmarker} different uh , um , training criterion {disfmarker} Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded {pause} uh {pause} embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But we don't know .\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: You gonna say something ?\nPhD F: Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what size net I should {disfmarker} Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?\nProfessor B: Uh , how much training data ?\nPhD F: Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set .\nProfessor B: And how {disfmarker} How many hours is that ?\nPhD F: That 's why I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how much that is .\nPhD D: Uh , I think that has about {disfmarker} Well i you 'd {disfmarker} would be gender - dependent training , right ? So {disfmarker} So I think it 's {disfmarker} uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .\nPhD F: Gender - dependent , yeah .\nPhD D: Thirty hours per gender .\nPhD F: Thirty hours .\nGrad A: I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .\nPhD F: In the small training set ?\nGrad A: Hello ?\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I think so . I 'll {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Excuse me ?\nPhD D: It 's definitely less than a hundred {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Alright .\nPhD D: You know , it 's more like {disfmarker} like thirty forty hours something like that .\nGrad A: Wrong number .\nPhD F: They called to tell us that ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um . So . Uh . after run\nPhD F: I mean , I didn't want to do too big ,\nProfessor B: Right . So\nPhD F: just {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: At least a couple thousand hidden units . I mean . It 's {disfmarker} it 's th the thing I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll think about it a little more\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .\nPhD F: Mmm .\nProfessor B: You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand . It 's m It 's more than {disfmarker}\nPhD F: And a thousand is too small ?\nProfessor B: Oh let me think about it , but I think that {disfmarker} that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling {pause} the amount of time .\nPhD D: Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there .\nGrad A: But not by a lot .\nProfessor B: Not by much .\nPhD D: And then {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?\nGrad A: Vast majority is from the input unit .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect .\nGrad A: Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah . It 's negligible , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Uh . There 's uh {disfmarker} How bi how big Let 's see . What am I trying to think of ?\nPhD F: The {disfmarker} The net that {disfmarker} that we did use already {pause} uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up .\nProfessor B: Right . And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of {disfmarker} of speech .\nPhD D: Was that gender - dependent or independent ?\nPhD F: Gender - dependent .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , uh , yeah definitely not the one thousand uh {disfmarker} two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost {disfmarker} will be faster and almost as good .\nGrad A: It 'll be faster .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . Uh , so that 's like eleven {disfmarker} eleven million frames . And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . So that 's probably {disfmarker} That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . I actually have to go .\nProfessor B: Alright .\nPhD D: So .\nProfessor B: Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} Uncle Bernie {disfmarker} yeah .\nGrad A: We 're just waiting for you to leave .\nProfessor B: Yes sir .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor B: Nah .\nGrad A: OK .\nProfessor B: Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour .\nGrad A: If {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So .\nGrad A: yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Uh , well , we started late .\nPhD F: Transcript\nProfessor B: de - ba - de . de - ba - de That 's all folks !\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group think about Dave leaving?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the group think about Dave leaving?", "context": "Grad A: OK , we 're on .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .  So . {vocalsound} The uh first was transcription status . Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ?\nPhD F: Um , sort of , I do , peripherally .\nPhD C: Is that English ?\nPhD F: Um {disfmarker} Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a {pause} week or week and a half ago\nPhD D: That 's our system .\nGrad A: Ugh !\nPhD F: and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that .\nGrad A: C can I have a pen ?\nPhD F: Um {disfmarker} Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings .\nPhD C: Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nPhD F: Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers\nPhD D: Speaking {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Which meetings is she transcribing ?\nPhD F: and {disfmarker} Um well we 've {disfmarker} we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: For IBM , yeah .\nPhD D: Hmm .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD F: and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .\nPhD D: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM\nGrad E: So we 're doing some in parallel .\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD F: No .\nGrad A: No , no .\nPhD F: Oh no no .\nGrad A: We haven't done that process .\nPhD D: no ?\nPhD F: No . We 're not waiting on them .\nGrad A: So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process .\nPhD D: Oh . Oh , OK .\nGrad E: So they 're just doing their own thing until {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Because I {disfmarker} I need to ask Jane whether it 's {disfmarker} it would be OK for her {disfmarker} um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions .\nPhD F: We 're doing it in parallel , yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: Um and we want it {disfmarker} You know , we need {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} Again , we {disfmarker} we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich\nGrad A: Right .\nPhD D: and get it transcribed and get it back . But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .\nGrad A: Yep , sounds familiar .\nPhD D: And so um I wanted to ask Jane if {disfmarker} if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could {disfmarker} could do {disfmarker} I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: um {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: There 's only two channels . So it 's only {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think .\nPhD D: It 's only two {disfmarker} Right , s\nPhD C: So .\nPhD D: Yeah . So {disfmarker} So it 's basically one channel to transcribe . And it 's {disfmarker} One session is only uh like seven {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So that should have ma many fewer {disfmarker} And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,\nPhD D: Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the {disfmarker} the thing that they 're reading\nProfessor B: right ? So . Yeah .\nPhD D: and they just may {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Make sure it 's right .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: And so um , um , I guess since she 's {disfmarker} I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I {disfmarker} maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah , well it certainly seems {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Uh if {disfmarker} if that 's OK with you to {disfmarker} to , you know , get that stuff uh {disfmarker} to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . OK , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Alrighty .\nPhD F: Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Can you mail that out to the list ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm , yeah I will . I {disfmarker} That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages\nGrad A: Oh , OK , OK .\nPhD F: and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .\nGrad A: Yeah , I haven't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: I 'll try to get to that . OK . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . I 'm just gonna do it . And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .\nProfessor B: You are going to {disfmarker}\nGrad A: I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to {pause} suggest edits . And then bleep them out .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad A: For the ones that we have . Um {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So but it 's just transcripts , not the {disfmarker} not the audio ?\nGrad A: Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also .\nPhD C: OK , yeah , yep . Ah .\nGrad A: I mean that 's my intention . Because the transcripts might not be right .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD F: So {disfmarker}\nGrad A: So you want people to be able to listen to them .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD F: So , um the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Oh , that 's a good point . That 's a good point . Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression .\nPhD F: Hmm . Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on\nGrad A: Well , that was the other point .\nPhD F: Oh , was that another one ?\nGrad A: Yep , that 's another agenda item .\nPhD F: OK . I 'll wait .\nGrad A: So , uh {disfmarker} But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . The back - end stuff is working out fine . It 's more or less ready to go . I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera and also by the user ID . So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well . Uh {disfmarker} The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy . So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and {disfmarker} and you and I can just talk about it off - line more .\nGrad E: Right .\nGrad A: But uh {pause} the back - end was pretty smooth .\nProfessor B: Oh\nGrad A: So I think , we 'll have something . It may not be as {disfmarker} As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something .\nProfessor B: I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point . He 's sort of been {disfmarker} been volunteering for everything\nGrad A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and {pause} and uh {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: O K . Finally said he was too busy . I guess we reached it .\nGrad A: Yeah , he {disfmarker} he actually {disfmarker} he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it . So . Oh well . Um {disfmarker}\nGrad E: And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display , and I don't know how much more we can do with it {disfmarker} with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom\nGrad A: Oh , cool .\nGrad E: so , right now it 's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know , it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it {disfmarker} think it has potential for a little something ,\nGrad A: For a demo ?\nGrad E: yeah , for a demo .\nGrad A: Yeah , sounds good .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: OK , so again , the issue is {disfmarker} For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on , but {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Oh . OK .\nGrad A: So it might just be slides .\nGrad E: Yeah , OK .\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nGrad E: Well , we 'll see , um {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . So hopefully that will work .\nPhD D: Really ? So is that {disfmarker} Because there 's some people um {disfmarker} It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at {disfmarker} at SRI\nPhD C: Yeah . Yep .\nPhD D: because the um {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack ,\nPhD D: we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah but {disfmarker} But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . It 's not on {disfmarker} on the web page anymore . But I just wrote an email to {disfmarker} to the author of {disfmarker} to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library\nGrad A: Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ?\nPhD C: and so it works . Yeah , but then you can't add our patches and then the {disfmarker} the new version is {disfmarker} is totally different\nGrad A: Oh .\nPhD C: a and in {disfmarker} yeah , in terms of {disfmarker} of the source code .\nGrad A: Ah .\nPhD C: You {disfmarker} you can't find the Tcl files anymore . It 's some whatever wrapped thing\nPhD D: Mmm .\nPhD C: and you can't {disfmarker} you can't access that so you have to install {disfmarker} First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then do the patches .\nGrad A: Patch . Ugh !\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I wonder if {disfmarker} if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad A: We have {disfmarker} Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet .\nPhD D: We have ? Oh . Oh , OK .\nPhD F: So did you um put the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page ? Or {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No , I haven't done that yet . I 'm {disfmarker} oh Nope . But I definitely will do that .\nProfessor B: So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . Just three different {disfmarker} It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I mean we could do it in Matl - {comment} I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure .\nPhD D: But {disfmarker} But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the {disfmarker} you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is {disfmarker} that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform .\nPhD C: Yep .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yes .\nGrad E: Yeah , that 'd be very cool .\nGrad A: It 'd be easy enough to add that . Again it 's {disfmarker} it 's {pause} It 's more Tcl - T\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad A: So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it ,\nPhD D: Right .\nGrad A: but uh , it wouldn't be hard to do .\nPhD D: Right . But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed .\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: S\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah , maybe we could l look into that .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad A: But it {disfmarker} it seems to me that I c\nPhD C: And {disfmarker}\nGrad A: It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary . So yo It seems to me you could do images .\nGrad E: Um {pause} What do you mean by real time ? Do you mean like {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad A: Yeah , jus Yeah .\nPhD F: Is that what you mean ?\nGrad A: It just seems to me jus\nGrad E: It would be cool to see it {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad E: It would be cool like to see {disfmarker} to hear it and see it ,\nPhD C: And to hear it . Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad E: and see the pitch contours also .\nGrad A: Sure , but I don't think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} You can do all that just statically in\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I think it would lose {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean y\nGrad A: Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Right , right . I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just {pause} like {pause} um view graphs or something .\nProfessor B: You know , wh Yeah . So . Uh , no , we 're talking about on the computer and {disfmarker} and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting ,\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor B: we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have and , {vocalsound} the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . So I think {disfmarker} {pause} For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so it 'd be a good thing to get in there . But , um {disfmarker} Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in {disfmarker} {pause} to people .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . So , we 're doing OK on backed up . We 're {disfmarker} We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . So , uh , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical , but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data {pause} all at once , in a lot of different ways .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD F: Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too .\nGrad A: Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers ,\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: An\nPhD F: Right .\nGrad A: so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . Um {disfmarker} And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . One of the things I was thinking is we {disfmarker} we just got these hundred {disfmarker} alright , excuse me {disfmarker} ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades .\nProfessor B: Did they come in ?\nPhD F: SUN - Blades .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD F: Yeah . They came in the other day .\nGrad A: They came in but they 're not set up yet .\nProfessor B: Oh .\nGrad A: And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those {pause} because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them .\nPhD F: Well , is there {disfmarker} Why not just hang them off of Abbott , is there a {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD F: Ah .\nProfessor B: Weren't we gonna get {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Ah , I see .\nProfessor B: Well , maybe it should get another rack .\nPhD D: But you still need to store the disks somehow .\nGrad A: Well , but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays .\nPhD D: So {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Just put them in .\nPhD F: You can put two {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Sure .\nPhD C: Internal . Yeah .\nGrad A: Yeah . Cuz the SUN {disfmarker} uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad A: So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nProfessor B: But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} file server {comment} it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something .\nPhD D: Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server .\nGrad A: Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions . What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ?\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: I see {vocalsound} {pause} Oh , I see .\nProfessor B: Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , mightn't you ? Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days ,\nGrad A: Oh , I didn't know he had left already .\nProfessor B: Uh , well , tonight .\nGrad A: Oh , oh well .\nPhD D: You mean he won't set up the {disfmarker} mmm .\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nGrad E: How much space do you need for these ?\nProfessor B: I don't know what his schedule is .\nGrad A: You {disfmarker} we need about a gig per meeting .\nProfessor B: I 'm just saying he 's gone .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD F: I {disfmarker} I thi\nGrad E: I have um {disfmarker} I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer .\nGrad A: Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ?\nGrad E: So {disfmarker} Uh , Samosa .\nProfessor B: You had an eighteen gigabyte drive .\nGrad E: Yeah , I had . Well it 's about {disfmarker} I think there 's about twelve gig left .\nGrad A: So it {disfmarker} And you have an X drives installed ? OK .\nGrad E: Yeah . So , I didn't realize it was so critical .\nGrad A: And you 're o you 're offering ?\nGrad E: I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are {disfmarker} new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything .\nGrad A: OK .\nGrad E: Um not that I can't do anything , I jus\nPhD F: I {disfmarker} I jus I just gave Thilo some {disfmarker} about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on {disfmarker} on uh Abbott . Uh {disfmarker} And uh {disfmarker} So but that {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Which one was that , X {pause} G ? X {pause} G ?\nPhD C: XG .\nPhD F: XG .\nGrad A: OK .\nPhD D: XG ?\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: That 's also where we store the {disfmarker} The uh Hub - five training set waveforms ,\nPhD C: Oops .\nGrad A: But that won't be getting any bigger ,\nPhD D: right ?\nPhD F: No .\nGrad A: will it ?\nPhD F: I don't think that 's on XG .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD F: On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD D: But I 've also been storing {disfmarker} I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are\nGrad E: Well {disfmarker}\nPhD D: and we won't be using the old ones anymore .\nGrad E: I have a lot of space , though .\nPhD F: Yeah , I do I don't think it was on XG .\nPhD D: Uh {disfmarker} Oh thats XA {disfmarker} Oh that 's X {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Isn't that XH ?\nPhD F: I th\nGrad A: Not {disfmarker} not for long .\nGrad E: I have a lot of space and it 's not {disfmarker} it 's n There 's very little uh {disfmarker} Yeah not for long .\nPhD D: Maybe I 'm confu\nGrad E: But I mean it 's not going f\nPhD D: Oh no I 'm sorry .\nGrad E: It 's not being used often at all .\nPhD C: But I 'm using XH {disfmarker} H , too .\nGrad A: Yeah , it 's probably {disfmarker} Probably only about four gig is on X {disfmarker} on your X drive ,\nPhD C: So .\nPhD D: Oh OK .\nGrad A: but we 'll definitely take it up if you {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I th\nPhD D: I think you 're right . It 's XH and D {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I think it 's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there ,\nPhD D: The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused .\nGrad E: three or four meetings .\nPhD D: OK .\nGrad A: Great .\nGrad E: So .\nGrad A: OK , so that will get us through the next couple days .\nProfessor B: We need {disfmarker} We need another gigaquad .\nGrad A: Yep . At least .\nProfessor B: There should {disfmarker} I d There should just be a b I should have a button .\nGrad A: The \" more disk space \" button ?\nProfessor B: Just press {disfmarker} Press each meeting saying \" we need more disk space \" {vocalsound} \" this week \" .\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: Skip the rest of the conversation .\nPhD F: Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings .\nProfessor B: And {disfmarker} And how much does each meeting take ?\nPhD F: And it 's about a gig uncompressed .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} It 's a little bit more as I usually don't {disfmarker} do not uncompress the {disfmarker} all of the PZM and the PDA things .\nPhD F: Is a little more ?\nPhD C: So .\nPhD F: Right , yeah so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} Yeah . One point five or something .\nPhD F: U Uh compressed how much are they ? Like {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Half a gig . For all of them .\nPhD F: About half ?\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . Yep .\nPhD F: So we 're definitely are storing you know , all of those . So there 's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far ?\nProfessor B: So - so So maybe there 's a hundred {pause} gig or something . Or {disfmarker} I mean . Cuz we {disfmarker} we have the uncompressed around also .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm . Right .\nProfessor B: So it 's like {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD F: Right . Well we {disfmarker} We haven't uncompressed all the meetings , but {disfmarker}\nGrad A: I would like to .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well I mean it 's {disfmarker} the they really are cheap . I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD F: Right .\nProfessor B: but But uh , we could {disfmarker} You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's small {disfmarker} I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars .\nPhD F: Yeah . Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for {disfmarker} if we could get some disk .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD F: I s I sent this out a {disfmarker} a day ago\nGrad A: And put it where ?\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD F: but {disfmarker} and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works . I mean does he just go out and get them and {disfmarker} if it 's OK , and {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD F: So I was assuming he was gonna take over {pause} that . But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . And just {vocalsound} say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . And in my answer back was \" are you sure you just want one ? \" So I mean I think {pause} that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure \" well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months \" .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: Wa - a I know what they want . The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . So they don't want to stack up external drives .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um {disfmarker} {pause} And then they want everything else in the machine room .\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad A: So the question is where are you gonna hang them ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm . I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room .\nGrad A: Right .\nPhD F: So .\nProfessor B: Right . So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave ,\nPhD D: Th - The {disfmarker}\nPhD F: I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the {disfmarker} the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now .\nProfessor B: cuz it {disfmarker}\nPhD D: One {disfmarker} Mmm .\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD D: One {disfmarker} One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is\nPhD F: So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff .\nPhD D: I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and {disfmarker} and you know recover the space .\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: Yeah . No . I think Dave {disfmarker} Dave knows all these things , of course . An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time .\nPhD D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: But I {disfmarker} I know that {pause} generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back {disfmarker} the {pause} back up system , rather than on new disk .\nPhD D: Mmm . Mmm .\nGrad A: So . Which {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well . So . But this {disfmarker} this is a very specific question for me . Basically , we can easily get {pause} one to four disks , I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal . Uh , but the question is where they go , and I don't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him .\nPhD D: Maybe we can put some disks in the {disfmarker} in that back room there .\nGrad A: Yeah really .\nProfessor B: Attach to {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Popcorn .\nProfessor B: Yeah ?\nPhD D: To the machine that collects the data . So then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there .\nGrad A: Yeah , it 's just {disfmarker} It 's not on the net , so it 's a little {pause} awkward\nPhD D: The only {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Hmm .\nPhD D: What do you mean it 's not on the net ?\nGrad A: It 's not {disfmarker}\nPhD C: It 's not bad .\nGrad A: It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S\nPhD D: Oh because it 's {disfmarker} because it 's an ACIRI machine ?\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Oh , oh oh .\nGrad A: And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net , but Who knows when that will happen ?\nPhD D: But that can't be that hard .\nPhD F: That might be a good short term solution , though .\nPhD D: I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad A: No , the {disfmarker} the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room {pause} that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers .\nPhD D: Oh ,\nGrad A: So , they actually have to run a wire somewhere .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal . If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} jus every ever everybody {disfmarker} everybody has a {disfmarker} has {disfmarker}\nGrad A: But Dave has to do all of them .\nProfessor B: Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing . But at any rate I think that there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need and I think we need a {disfmarker} a conversation with {disfmarker} Uh , maybe {disfmarker} maybe after {disfmarker} after tea or something you and I can go down and {disfmarker} and talk to him about it Just say \" wha you know , what should we do right now ? \"\nPhD F: How long is David gonna be gone ?\nProfessor B: Uh , eleven days or something ?\nGrad A: Oh my !\nProfessor B: Yeah basically tomorrow and all of {pause} the week after .\nGrad A: And that 's all I have .\nProfessor B: Um {disfmarker} Let 's see . The only oth thing {disfmarker} other thing I was gonna add was that um {disfmarker} uh , I talked briefly to Mari and uh we had {vocalsound} both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the {pause} last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . And I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wanna do next meeting is {disfmarker} is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . I mean just sort of bulletize I mean o e do do I can {disfmarker} I can dream up text but {pause} this is basically gonna lead to the annual report . So {pause} Um {disfmarker} If w\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: This is the fifteenth ? So just a week from tomorrow ?\nProfessor B: Um , that would\nGrad A: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . So , uh , we can {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} So that 's an {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Is this gotta be in the morning ?\nProfessor B: Um {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Or {disfmarker} Because you know I {disfmarker} Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two . So if it could be before that would be be\nProfessor B: No , no but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't need other folks for the meeting . I can do it . A A All I 'm saying is that on {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Oh , OK , alright . Oh I 'm sorry , I misunderstood .\nProfessor B: Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting {pause} if I wa something I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her .\nPhD D: I thought you are {disfmarker} OK . Alright . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I think I have a pretty good idea\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker} but um {disfmarker} Uh , and then the next day uh , late in the day I 'll be having that {disfmarker} that discussion with her .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nProfessor B: Um . So .\nPhD D: Um {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} One thing {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} in past meetings we had um also a you know various {disfmarker} variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the {disfmarker} on the recognition side\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: um but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically . So . Um . And I wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting and between you know , whoever 's interested in that because I feel that uh there 's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Think so ?\nPhD D: Well , it 's that {disfmarker} It 's just gonna be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system .\nGrad A: I 'm interested .\nProfessor B: Well , OK , so how many {disfmarker} how many people here would not be interested in uh {disfmarker} in a meeting about recognition ?\nPhD C: Me too .\nPhD F: Jane may not be .\nGrad A: Jane , I think .\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD D: Well I know {disfmarker} Well , Jane an Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this {disfmarker}\nGrad A: No . If we talked about it in this meeting .\nPhD F: He 's wondering how much overlap there will be .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so you 're su\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD D: So , uh , uh , Liz and Jane probably .\nProfessor B: OK , so we 're gonna have a guy 's meeting .\nPhD D: Uh . {vocalsound} Uh , if you wanna put it that way .\nPhD F: Good thing Liz isn't here .\nProfessor B: Real {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Watch a ball game ?\nProfessor B: Yeah , real {disfmarker} real {disfmarker} real men {vocalsound} \" Real men do decoding \" or something like that .\nPhD F: Don't listen to this , Liz .\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nPhD D: I mean it it 's sort of {disfmarker} I mean when {disfmarker} when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I 'm bored .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: The {disfmarker} Nod off ?\nPhD D: So it 's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to {disfmarker} i to {disfmarker} to be uh {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} I cou you know {disfmarker} this could {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: It 's cuz {pause} y you have a {disfmarker} So you need a better developed feminine side .\nPhD D: I 'm\nProfessor B: There 's probably gonna be a lot of \" bleeps \" in this meeting .\nPhD D: not sure I wanna {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Yeah , I would as {comment} I would guess .\nProfessor B: Uh . Um .\nPhD D: Yeah and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: I think it must be {pause} uh nearing the end of the week . Um . {vocalsound} Yeah . I {disfmarker} You know , I {disfmarker} I 've heard some comments about like this . That m could be .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I mean the {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} U\nPhD D: And we don't have to do it every week .\nPhD F: Could we {disfmarker}\nPhD D: We could do it every other week or so . You know , whatev or whenever we feel like we {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Right , I was {disfmarker} Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ?\nGrad A: Or just alternate the focus .\nPhD F: Tha - That 's what I mean .\nGrad A: Yeah , so on even weeks have {pause} basic {pause} on data .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: We could do that , yeah .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Personally I 'd {disfmarker} I 'm not in favor of more meetings . Um . {vocalsound} Because , uh .\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad A: I am .\nPhD D: You know .\nGrad A: Oh sor\nPhD F: But I do I don't {disfmarker} I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder .\nPhD D: Right .\nGrad A: Well , except that we keep going for our full time .\nPhD F: So if we did that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yep .\nPhD F: Well , cuz we get into these other topics .\nGrad A: Yeah .\nPhD D: We feel {disfmarker} We feel obligated to collect more data .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad A: Ugh .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad A: I don't .\nPhD F: So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Let 's read digits and go .\nProfessor B: Why don't we just start with that .\nPhD D: ummh . {comment} ummh . {comment} OK .\nProfessor B: And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But I {disfmarker} I think that 's a great idea . Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane {pause} when we get a chance , see what they think and {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: Yeah that would be good . I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd {disfmarker} you know , where do we go from here kind of things and {disfmarker} So , it would be good .\nProfessor B: Yeah , and you 're {disfmarker} you 're attending {pause} the uh {disfmarker} the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have {disfmarker} you have probably one of the best {disfmarker} you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two .\nGrad A: Bridge .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: We are doing recognition in both of them . So .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nGrad A: OK ?\nPhD D: So um . So {disfmarker} so we could talk a little bit about that now if {disfmarker} if there 's some time .\nGrad A: No , no that would be for next week .\nPhD D: Um I jus So the latest result was that um um yot I tested the uh {disfmarker} the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for {disfmarker} for this year 's Hub - five test set .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the {disfmarker} you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end .\nGrad A: Mmm .\nPhD F: For both females and males ?\nPhD D: Yes . Uh , well i there was a little bit of a {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Oh !\nPhD D: i overall . They {disfmarker} They were {disfmarker} The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: I mean definitely not significant .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: And then the really nice thing was that if {disfmarker} if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .\nGrad A: Wow . Just with ROVER ?\nPhD D: So . t With N - best ROVER , which is like our {vocalsound} new and improved version of ROVER .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems {pause} to {pause} mmm , uh {pause} c combine that .\nProfessor B: So except {disfmarker} I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD D: And , the {disfmarker}\nPhD F: But a percent and a half ?\nGrad A: Yeah , it 's pretty {pause} impressive .\nPhD F: That 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: And {disfmarker} And so uh after I told the {disfmarker} my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a {disfmarker} Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination . Um , and , you know , why not ?\nProfessor B: Sure , why not ?\nPhD D: Uh . {vocalsound} So .\nGrad A: We clearly gotta add a few more features , though .\nPhD D: Uh w what do you mean ? More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ?\nGrad A: No , uh front - end features . You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra . Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Oh I mean {disfmarker} Yeah . Well Right . So , we cou Yeah . That 's {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} There 's one thing uh {disfmarker} I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end {disfmarker} You know , if you {disfmarker} you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems\nPhD F: Oh .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: and {disfmarker} Um . So . So one {disfmarker} one compromise would be to {disfmarker} only to have the {disfmarker} everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing .\nProfessor B: Mmm . An\nPhD D: So .\nPhD F: Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I think so . Yeah . Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if {disfmarker} You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: So . Um {pause} Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely .\nGrad A: Cool .\nPhD D: And then we had some results on {pause} digits , uh , with um {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} So this was uh really {comment} {disfmarker} really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: And so , uh . But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD D: And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor B: Including digits I gather , yeah .\nPhD D: And you c And {disfmarker} Not all of {disfmarker} No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it .\nProfessor B: A fifth of it is how much ?\nPhD D: The rest is {disfmarker} is read {disfmarker} is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that .\nProfessor B: Right . But a fi a fifth is how much ?\nPhD D: A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the {pause} amount of training that there was .\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD D: But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there\nProfessor B: Oh yeah\nPhD D: because we 're doing {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: w\nPhD D: You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT {disfmarker} {comment} uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: which is only what two hours something ?\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad A: I don't know .\nPhD D: So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps . And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .\nProfessor B: Yeah that was the interesting thing .\nPhD D: That 's e\nProfessor B: Because {disfmarker} because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better ,\nPhD D: That was e Right , right .\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker} but uh .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD F: Well is there even more read speech data around ?\nPhD D: Oh , yeah . So we only {disfmarker} for the Hub - five training , we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone {pause} database .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better .\nGrad A: I could also put in {pause} uh focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Right . Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data . I mean , Wall Street Journal , {pause} uh , take one example .\nGrad A: Yeah . That 's right .\nPhD D: But um . So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the {disfmarker} the digit recognizers to {disfmarker} to use uh something other than TI - digits .\nGrad A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Well they been using TIMIT .\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: That {disfmarker} Uh . {pause} They {disfmarker} they uh {disfmarker} they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and {disfmarker} and uh , um , {disfmarker} and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT .\nGrad A: Hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh {disfmarker} But uh {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} So that 's what they 're {disfmarker} they 're using now .\nPhD D: Mmm .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but yeah certainly if we , um {disfmarker} If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Once we know , then {disfmarker} the trainable parts of it {disfmarker} it 'd be great to run lots of {disfmarker} lots of stuff through .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Right . Well , that was that . And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system and {disfmarker} You wanna {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You wanna see where that stands ?\nPhD F: Well , I 'm {disfmarker}\nPhD D: \nPhD F: Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses . And so I 'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with . And uh so then I 'll train the net . And .\nPhD D: An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's {disfmarker} um that the phone set would change . So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Right . Eight .\nPhD D: forty - eight phones ?\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that {disfmarker} that we 've been using so far .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that will probably help , actually ,\nPhD F: So it 's a little different ?\nPhD D: because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the {disfmarker} as far as just the um , um {disfmarker} Just {disfmarker} You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features . And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three . And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the {pause} phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .\nProfessor B: Sure . Although we {disfmarker} I mean , it 's not that many fewer and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and we take a KLT anyway so we could {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . Exactly .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: So {disfmarker} so that was the other thing . And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end . So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .\nProfessor B: Yeah , and I think {disfmarker} and we sh again check {disfmarker} we should check with Stephane . My impression was that when we did that before that had very little {disfmarker} uh he didn't lose very much .\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD F: By just taking the top whatever ?\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: Yeah yeah .\nPhD D: But then {disfmarker} And then something {disfmarker} Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system .\nProfessor B: And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system .\nPhD D: Exactly .\nPhD F: Right .\nPhD D: Yeah . So that would basically give us a , um , more {disfmarker} hopefully a {disfmarker} a better system\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: um because {disfmarker} you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard or s uh and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: But he {disfmarker} I think he d he didn't {disfmarker} he probably didn't use all the training data that was available . And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as {disfmarker} as the {disfmarker} as ours is .\nProfessor B: That 's {disfmarker} That 's certainly one thing , yeah .\nPhD D: So .\nProfessor B: Uh . Yeah .\nPhD D: And the dictionary made a huge difference . Uh . We {disfmarker} we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh {disfmarker} to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a {disfmarker} uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard , which {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well the other thing is , dipping {pause} deep into history and into uh our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Mmm .\nProfessor B: uh it was {disfmarker} I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , uh {pause} at the time .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh . {pause} And . Later we got away from it because {disfmarker} because once we had decent systems going then it was {disfmarker} it was typically better to use our own systems\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: cuz they were self consistent but {disfmarker} but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate . Uh . {vocalsound} But that was a {disfmarker} that was a good {disfmarker} good {disfmarker} good way to start .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: And we 're not quite that bad with our {disfmarker} our Switchboard systems but it was {disfmarker} they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's ,\nPhD D: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: so {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right .\nPhD F: W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ? Roughly ?\nProfessor B: Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent {pause} error . And uh it was {disfmarker} I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for . We never did really fix up the dictionary . Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and {disfmarker} and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did .\nPhD D: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor B: Uh , we never did an never did any adaptation\nPhD D: But that w Even that {disfmarker} that number {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: uh , we never did any {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . And {disfmarker} And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data , right ? Where the error rate now is in the twenties .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: So , um .\nProfessor B: So we were {disfmarker} Yeah . We were probably at least a factor or two off .\nPhD D: That 's yet s Right .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: So it would be {disfmarker} So it would be good t to sort of r re uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do .\nProfessor B: Yeah . But I think {disfmarker} again it 's {disfmarker} Yeah . It 's the conver it 's the s conversational speech bit . Because our {disfmarker} our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: He knows .\nPhD D: Right . And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up . Right ? Because it 's a pretty good um indicator of that .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs {pause} before we go ahead and train up the {disfmarker} uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It 'll still probably be worse . I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be context independent and so on .\nPhD D: No . Sure . Not {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Should we {disfmarker} Should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training ?\nProfessor B: But .\nPhD D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD F: I mean should {disfmarker} should we even use that ?\nPhD D: Oh {pause} oh that 's a good question .\nPhD F: Or should I just go straight to {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah , we {disfmarker} we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign .\nGrad A: Try it . You run it ? Keep {disfmarker} keep both versions ? See which one 's better ?\nProfessor B: Uh , yeah . I mean . I think I agree with Ad I mean basically you would then {disfmarker} You proceed with the embedded training .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: It 's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Right .\nProfessor B: And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did .\nPhD D: OK . Alright .\nPhD F: Mmm .\nGrad A: I could make arguments either way . You know , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: But {disfmarker} But so I {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Sort of given up guessing .\nPhD D: Well but i But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got\nProfessor B: Uh well . It depended on the task . I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: because we 're coming from uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system .\nPhD D: That are from another {disfmarker} Right .\nGrad A: Although , I mean we 've done it with {disfmarker} When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse .\nPhD D: Right .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nGrad A: Which I 've never figured out .\nProfessor B: Right . But I mean i\nGrad A: I think it 's a bug .\nPhD D: So you {disfmarker} you started training with outputs from a {disfmarker} with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ?\nGrad A: Yep .\nPhD D: And then {disfmarker} Uh .\nGrad A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Hmm . Well , that might probably just {disfmarker} Hmm . That was probably because your initial system {disfmarker} I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge 's . And you {disfmarker} Um .\nProfessor B: Was it ? I don't think it was .\nGrad A: No they were {disfmarker} they were comparable .\nPhD D: It wasn't ?\nProfessor B: No .\nGrad A: They were very close .\nPhD D: Really ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: That 's weird .\nProfessor B: Excuse me ?\nPhD D: That 's {disfmarker} That 's weird .\nGrad A: That 's what I said .\nProfessor B: Oh !\nPhD D: No I mean it 's weird that it did {disfmarker} I 'm sorry . It 's w It 's weird that it got worse .\nPhD F: That 's ambiguous .\nProfessor B: Um . No . Uh . Tha - u we we 've see I mean {disfmarker} and wi with the numbers {disfmarker} OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better .\nPhD D: Oh actually it 's not that weird because we have seen {disfmarker} We have seen cases where acoustic {disfmarker} retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It just {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: But I But I would {disfmarker} I would suspect that something that {disfmarker} that had um a very different Um feature set , for instance {disfmarker} I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us .\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor B: I {disfmarker} I would expect that something that had a different feature set would {disfmarker} would uh benefit from {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: What about uh hidden unit size {pause} on this .\nProfessor B: Oh , wait a minute , and the other thing uh ,\nPhD F: Oh .\nProfessor B: sorry , it was {disfmarker} the other thing is that what was in common {comment} to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors .\nGrad A: Right . Ah yeah .\nProfessor B: So I mean , uh , that 's another pretty big difference\nGrad A: That 's another big difference .\nProfessor B: and uh , one bac at least {disfmarker} Back at {disfmarker}\nPhD D: You mean with soft targets ? Or {disfmarker} ? Sorry , I 'm sor I missed {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} What 's the key issue here ?\nProfessor B: Oh , that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were {disfmarker} were training {pause} posteriors . And if we 're {disfmarker} we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . So {disfmarker} so that 's another difference .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different {disfmarker} different uh , um , training criterion {disfmarker} Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded {pause} uh {pause} embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But we don't know .\nPhD D: OK .\nProfessor B: You gonna say something ?\nPhD F: Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what size net I should {disfmarker} Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?\nProfessor B: Uh , how much training data ?\nPhD F: Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set .\nProfessor B: And how {disfmarker} How many hours is that ?\nPhD F: That 's why I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how much that is .\nPhD D: Uh , I think that has about {disfmarker} Well i you 'd {disfmarker} would be gender - dependent training , right ? So {disfmarker} So I think it 's {disfmarker} uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .\nPhD F: Gender - dependent , yeah .\nPhD D: Thirty hours per gender .\nPhD F: Thirty hours .\nGrad A: I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .\nPhD F: In the small training set ?\nGrad A: Hello ?\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I think so . I 'll {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Excuse me ?\nPhD D: It 's definitely less than a hundred {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Alright .\nPhD D: You know , it 's more like {disfmarker} like thirty forty hours something like that .\nGrad A: Wrong number .\nPhD F: They called to tell us that ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um . So . Uh . after run\nPhD F: I mean , I didn't want to do too big ,\nProfessor B: Right . So\nPhD F: just {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: At least a couple thousand hidden units . I mean . It 's {disfmarker} it 's th the thing I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll think about it a little more\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .\nPhD F: Mmm .\nProfessor B: You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand . It 's m It 's more than {disfmarker}\nPhD F: And a thousand is too small ?\nProfessor B: Oh let me think about it , but I think that {disfmarker} that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling {pause} the amount of time .\nPhD D: Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there .\nGrad A: But not by a lot .\nProfessor B: Not by much .\nPhD D: And then {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?\nGrad A: Vast majority is from the input unit .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect .\nGrad A: Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah . It 's negligible , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Uh . There 's uh {disfmarker} How bi how big Let 's see . What am I trying to think of ?\nPhD F: The {disfmarker} The net that {disfmarker} that we did use already {pause} uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up .\nProfessor B: Right . And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of {disfmarker} of speech .\nPhD D: Was that gender - dependent or independent ?\nPhD F: Gender - dependent .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , uh , yeah definitely not the one thousand uh {disfmarker} two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost {disfmarker} will be faster and almost as good .\nGrad A: It 'll be faster .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD F: Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD F: OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . Uh , so that 's like eleven {disfmarker} eleven million frames . And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . So that 's probably {disfmarker} That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Right . I actually have to go .\nProfessor B: Alright .\nPhD D: So .\nProfessor B: Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} Uncle Bernie {disfmarker} yeah .\nGrad A: We 're just waiting for you to leave .\nProfessor B: Yes sir .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor B: Nah .\nGrad A: OK .\nProfessor B: Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour .\nGrad A: If {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So .\nGrad A: yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Uh , well , we started late .\nPhD F: Transcript\nProfessor B: de - ba - de . de - ba - de That 's all folks !", "answers": ["The group needed Dave Johnson to install the some one hundred SUN - Blades that had arrived and would help with storage.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is\u00a0a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now \u00a320,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE\u00a0recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want\u00a0to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me\u2014what the research does show\u2014that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim\u00a0Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state\u2014significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner\u2014it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status\u2014so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that\u2014there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'\u2014actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE\u00a0route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE\u00a0is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important\u2014that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside\u00a0Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'm very keen to increase the diversity in our teaching workforce and I'm very keen in looking at career changers, who perhaps have different life experience and work experience, coming into our teaching profession.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that. Part of that diversity, of course\u2014it would be great if you had more people interested in qualifying to teach through the medium of Welsh. Great aspirations; the trend's going the other way. No-one can solve this in 280 characters, I get that, but can you give us some indication about why you think this is proving still such an unattractive option when it's clear that there's a policy for this country to improve the number of Welsh speakers? You'd have thought there'd be a pretty good carrot for this.\nKirsty Williams AM: Sure. Again, data for recruitment for the 2018-19 cohort is not yet available and we are, as I said, keeping in touch with our ITE\u00a0centres to keep a close eye on them. I think an important thing to recognise is that there is a difference between the number of people who are on courses where there is a specific designation that enables them to teach through the medium of Welsh and those people who have linguistic ability and Welsh ability but don't necessarily do a course that allows them. So, there is a difference. We do think that, for the 2016-17 cohort, there were an additional 130 qualifiers\u00a0that, actually, were fluent in Welsh and who could have gone on to teach in Welsh-medium schools, didn't necessarily do a course that gave them that designation. But, clearly, we've got three academic years now to get to the targets that we've set ourselves. The evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in ITE reported at the end of last month, and the Minister and officials are busy working now to implement the recommendations of the report that was published, I think, on 28 September, to be able to move this agenda forward. Again, we've got new incentives, this year, both for people starting their course and then for teachers who complete their QTS after a year. So, we've added in new financial incentives this year to try and address some of those issues. But, clearly, these are ambitious targets and we will need to have a step change over the next three years if we're to meet them.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that, Cabinet Secretary. Thank you for that answer. We're now talking about cohorts of students coming into\u00a0PGCE and teaching degrees. If they're from Wales, they will have had Welsh as part of their education from day one, and we'll accept there are varying\u00a0qualities in different parts of Wales, different attitudes towards it as well. But there isn't a single a person now who's been through Welsh education who can say they have no Welsh at all, unless they've moved into the system\u00a0from, say, England very, very recently. What is being done within the teaching qualifications, including the degrees, to ensure that, at least in Welsh universities, those nascent Welsh language skills are at least kept alive, even though we're not talking necessarily about being at a level where people can teach through the medium? It's\u00a0the age-old question: once the school gate closes, is that the end of their Welsh use? So, is there something\u2014it won't be Donaldson, but in the teacher training qualifications\u2014that is keeping this going and, hopefully, increasing the usability of the Welsh skills they have?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, in terms of how we can encourage children who have got Welsh skills as a result of their education up to 16, how they can\u00a0continue to use those skills and, potentially, use them in the workplace, I'm sure Eluned will want to talk about\u00a0some of the work, for instance, in other, non-teaching sectors. But, with regard to ITE, you'll be aware that, in the evaluation report, as I said, that was published, the report comes forward with two options in how we could develop an intervention programme to support Welsh language\u00a0skills\u00a0amongst all primary and secondary ITE\u00a0entrants. So, what we'll be doing now as a result of that report is that we'll be working very closely with our ITE\u00a0centres\u00a0to develop and agree upon minimum provision that constitutes those skill levels within ITE\u00a0provision for all teachers.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: You have your targets for 2021, in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system, which is positive, although, clearly, the report or the review itself said that, actually, we need to double the numbers, really. But it's not just the trends that are going down; it's a cataclysmic drop, really. We've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh. So, it's a huge turnaround that we're looking for, and I'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you're giving here this morning\u00a0reflect the level of action that's\u00a0needed, really.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, first of all, as I tried to illustrate to Suzy, the figures on their\u00a0own\u00a0tell one story, but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak Welsh and to be able to use\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: I think it's\u00a040 per cent\u00a0of those who are currently in the system who don't\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM: \u2014the language and skills. And if we look at qualifiers of ITE courses in Wales by degree type, actually, we see a different trend\u2014we see numbers going up. So, there are statistics and there are statistics. Depending on which ones you look at, it's quite a complex picture. And that's why we had the evaluation report. We understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done. That's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ITE\u00a0and that's why we'll be taking that ambition\u00a0forward. We know what we need to do. As I said, we're not sitting back and hoping\u00a0that something miraculous will change things. We are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you for that. Clearly, there are statistics\u00a0and there are statistics, so could you just explain to us which statistics you've used for your targets for growth over the next three years?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you're projecting?\nKirsty Williams AM: We're using the baseline of 2012-13. There has been a decline since then.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: That's the one I was using when I said '24 per cent reduction'.\nKirsty Williams AM: There has been a decline in those numbers. That's why, as I said, we're doing the work that we need to do to reverse that decline. In using those numbers, we also know that there are additional people in the system who are not captured in those figures and who do have the linguistic ability to use their language positively in school settings. So, what I'm saying is that that doesn't tell us the whole story, but I will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ITE providers to ensure that we will have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions, and I'm not hiding from that.\nEluned Morgan AM: Also, I just think it's worth saying that a lot of this is about building the confidence of those people who actually can speak Welsh, who are not teaching through the medium of Welsh, and to give them that support. First of all, we need to identify who these people are, so there is a job of work being undertaken now in terms of registration in particular\u2014when people register, let's just make sure that we collect that kind of data.\nKirsty Williams AM: We don't even do that consistently at the moment. One of the recommendations of the report is that there is no consistent approach to understanding this baseline data and there's no consistent competency test that people start at the beginning of their course, so we need a national approach rather than leaving it to individual institutions.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Have we missed any tricks, potentially, in terms of the reforms to accrediting ITE, for example, in terms of, maybe, strengthening aspects around the Welsh language and provision in that respect?\nKirsty Williams AM: No, I don't believe so. The accreditation process, which is independent of the Government\u2014the accreditation process demands of our ITE\u00a0providers that their provision will be able to meet the goals of our curriculum. Our curriculum is very clear about the equality of the language and the ability of our children, through all stages of their education journey, to be able to be bilingual children.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, that requirement, as far you're concerned, is there.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, okay. Diolch\u2014thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Before I turn to Hefin, can I just clarify\u2014? In answer to Suzy Davies, you said that 65 per cent of the places in Welsh training centres\u00a0had been filled. Is that 65 per cent of the priority places?\nKirsty Williams AM: Priority places.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nKirsty Williams AM: Sixty-five per cent of the priority courses are being met.\nLynne Neagle AM: Lovely, thank you for clarifying that. Hefin.\nHefin David AM: The decision by the Education\u00a0Workforce Council\u00a0not to accredit the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training\u2014what are your views and concerns about that?\nKirsty Williams AM: The process is independent of Government, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that, especially as I understand that there is an appeals process that may be being undertaken. What I would say is that from the very outset of our ITE\u00a0reforms we have made it very clear that I expect very high standards in our ITE\u00a0system, but the process is independent of this Government. I have confidence in the people who have been appointed by the EWC\u00a0to undertake that process, but it is independent of me, and it's not appropriate for me to comment on that further.\nHefin David AM: I fully understand that and the need for distance for the EWC, but there'll be an impact on students and staff. Students, first of all: are you concerned that the reduction in providers might have an impact on students, and those students going through the second year at USW? Would you have concerns about that issue?\nKirsty Williams AM: In terms of the overall numbers, we will be looking to commission from those institutions that have been accredited the number of training places that our planning tool says that we need. So, in terms of an overall number of places, we will commission from those accredited units. Clearly, there will be a responsibility upon the University of South Wales to ensure that those students already in the system are able to complete their studies and their course, with the appropriate level of support and tuition to enable them to achieve their career aspirations and to graduate from that programme.\nHefin David AM: And what about the uncertainty for staff, or would you say that's an issue for the university itself?\nKirsty Williams AM: These are autonomous bodies. They have to act accordingly, in compliance with any employment law or any statutory responsibilities that they would have as an employer. That's not a matter for me; that is a matter for the institution that is an autonomous body.\nHefin David AM: But I would be surprised if you weren't keeping an eye on this, given that it has been a key provider. Are you aware of when the appeal decision will be known?\nKirsty Williams AM: My understanding is that the appeals process is ongoing, and next month, perhaps. But as I said, this is a process that is independent of Government\u2014\nHefin David AM: But it will have an impact for what you do.\nKirsty Williams AM: It will potentially change the nature of the people from whom we commission places, but as I said, I do not have any concerns that we will not be in a position to commission the appropriate number of training places that we will need as a result of our planning.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy on this\u2014mindful of what the Minister said about it being an independent decision.\nSuzy Davies AM: It's not directly about USW; it's about the geographic spread of provision. I wonder if you could just give us a snapshot of what that looks like, and whether you think\u2014certainly for PGCE or postgrad courses, anyway\u2014that if they're not accessible geographically and we've got students who already have three years' worth of debt, they're not going to be looking to, necessarily, live away from home for a fourth year, and may want to study nearer home. Has there been any research done on the access to these postgrad\u00a0courses, about where people are coming from and whether that's had an impact on the fact that some of these places haven't been filled?\nKirsty Williams AM: Currently, with our current providers, there is a significant geographical spread. There are centres here in the south-east, there are centres\u00a0in the south-west, in mid Wales, and in north Wales. Obviously, accessibility is an issue for us. We do think that, for some students, accessibility is an issue, and of course that's why we are responding with our part-time PGCE\u00a0route, which actually will be location neutral, because you will be able to study that as a distance learner, and so you will be able to remain in your community and undertake that course. So, that's part of the attractiveness, I believe, of offering that to people. So, if geographical disadvantage is stopping somebody from pursuing a career aspiration to qualify as a teacher, our new part-time PGCE, as I said, will allow them to do that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Thanks, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to talk about reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector. Janet Finch-Saunders.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Good morning. There are some encouraging provisional signs regarding the demand for part-time undergraduate study for the first year of Diamond, but the \u00a312.5 million reduction\u00a0Higher Education Funding Council for Wales\u00a0is having to make this academic year has potentially placed the funding for part-time provision under pressure. Is there a danger that, without maintaining and growing this funding, Welsh Government will undermine the Diamond reforms and increase the cost of part-time courses?\nKirsty Williams AM: Let's be absolutely clear what this Government has done for part-time students. We are unique, Janet: unique in the UK and, I believe, unique in Europe, in the parity of the support that is available for full-time and part-time students. So, Welsh part-timers have something that they do not get if they are in England or if they're in Scotland. It's too early to have definitive figures for the impact of Diamond on the number of people who are undertaking part-time study. I don't want to get into trouble by not having that verified data, and I know Members get testy with me for anecdotal evidence, but I can tell you this: there is one provider that is reporting at this moment a 40 per cent increase in the number of students that are registered to start part-time study with them this year, as compared to last year, and that reflects really, really well, compared to the onward downward trend that we see across the border for part-time. What this means, for us as a nation, is that people are able to take this opportunity to upskill themselves and to be able to develop their qualifications and to be able to move themselves up career ladders, and I think that's such an important economic factor for us. So, rather than feeling doom and gloom about the prospects for the part-time sector, the early indications, at least, show that the Diamond reforms are leading to an increase in demand and, more importantly, an increase in uptake\u2014students taking advantage of that system to go away and study.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Is the Welsh Government able to reassure the committee that its ambitions for the post-compulsory education and training\u00a0reforms are still in line with the original Hazelkorn recommendations, and go beyond the Labour manifesto commitment of simply replacing HEFCW with a new funding body for HE and FE?\nKirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, you will be aware, Janet, that the agreement between myself and the First Minister that brought me into the Government and the Government's programme state very clearly about our desire to pursue the recommendations of the Hazelkorn report. I hope, by the end of this week, we will have published the responses to the technical consultation, and we will continue to move forward. And I would argue, certainly, that the reforms that we are intending to implement do go beyond just simply a body that replaces HEFCW and joins in FE. It's a much wider remit to the potential new commission. And, as I said, I believe we've had in the region of about 450 responses to the technical consultation and I'm pleased to say that there remains a consensus\u2014we will always have some arguments about the details\u2014but there remains a consensus on the direction of travel that we are pursuing. A summary of the consultation responses will be available to Members and will be published by the end of the week.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. Is the Welsh Government still committed to introducing the PCET Bill before the end of the fifth Assembly, and are you confident this will happen?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, I'm absolutely determined that we will get the PCET legislation on the floor. It's a substantial piece of work, as you've just alluded to. This goes just beyond abolishing a single body. So, it is a substantial piece of work, but I believe that we are on track to be able to do that by the end of this term. But it's a big piece of work.\nLynne Neagle AM: Llyr, on this.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Can I just pick up on that? I mean, it is going to be a big job, and, clearly, there's a strong focus on creating the commission and putting the structures in place, but, of course, one of the drivers is that we want to effect a cultural change in the way that people perceive post-16 education. This thing about parity of esteem and all that kind of agenda. And a key part of this process, therefore, is the vision that people are waiting for. When are we going to see this coming forward? Because I think we're putting structures in place, so there's a big discussion about the technical stuff, but I feel there's a bit of a vacuum\u00a0in terms of the vision.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, I would disagree with you, Llyr, because\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Right, okay. Well, maybe you should have come to the cross-party group on further education last night.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, I would disagree with you because, of course, the technical consultation has followed what we had last year, which was a consultation on the vision, on what we needed to do to bring the sector together beyond just HE and FE, to the inclusion of sixth forms; work-based learning providers; apprenticeships; and bringing all of that together under one body. I believe that that gives us an opportunity to have better strategic planning; to help us prevent duplication; to help us bridge gaps that are not available for learners at the moment. It will, hopefully\u2014. My vision is that it will promote collaboration between institutions rather than simply having the market-based process that we see in other places where there's competition rather than collaboration. I want to see it strengthen links between schools, FE and HE, strengthen links between schools and employers and business, to make sure that we've got better information and advice services so that young people know what their pathways are and can make really informed choices about what's best for them, to help them make them. So, I think: we've done the vision, we're now doing the technical consultation, that will be published by the end of the week, and we'll move forward with our overarching vision that Hazelkorn elaborated and that we are now taking forward.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, you would be very concerned if FE institutions were saying that we really need to see the vision, that that's the next step, that we really need to understand the vision.\nKirsty Williams AM: But, I've met\u2014. As I said, I was with one of our excellent FE leaders\u00a0just at the end of last week; it wasn't raised with me then. I do understand that there are concerns from the FE sector about will the vision be realised. I think there's a shared understanding of the vision, but I understand and I\u00a0do see some nervousness about, actually, in the end, will this just be HEFCW by another name, and, the opportunity for FE, will this be realised in this new body? We need to keep ensuring that, as we go forward and develop the policy, and as we develop, eventually, the legislation, that that parity of esteem and that true equality across all parts of the sector is realised.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. Our next questions are from Michelle Brown.\nMichelle Brown AM: Good morning, Cabinet Secretary; good morning, Minister. Your paper to the committee says that there's a need for more analysis and research into the outcomes for learners from different backgrounds. At the same time, Welsh universities have declared \u00a3104 million towards equality and opportunity activity for 2018. If you don't have the analysis, how can you be sure that the investment that's being made by the Welsh universities is actually going to have a positive outcome in the right places and lead to better outcomes for underrepresented groups?\nKirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, of course, that would be one of the duties of the new commission set up as a result of our\u00a0post-compulsory education and training reforms that I would anticipate. The universities are required, under the\u00a0Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015, to produce fee and access statements, and the \u00a3104 million that they have to take off their fees to be able to promote this work\u2014those fee and access plans have to be signed off by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales as being robust and truly promoting equality of opportunity. They're also there to promote access and the opportunities for people to aspire to higher education. We are looking at\u2014.\u00a0It's quite early days, still, for that new regulatory regime to come through, so we ask HEFCW, when I meet with HEFCW, about the adequacy of those plans. Equity is an important part of my approach to higher education. That's why we're introducing the Diamond reforms\u2014so that those from the poorest backgrounds can be adequately financially supported and are not put off from going to a university. And we're also looking\u2014. I would envisage under PCET a better mechanism of tracking destinations for learners. So, for instance, in the FE sector, we're introducing new joint monitoring for outcomes for sixth-form learners and FE learners, because we've never tracked them in the same way. So, we're introducing that now so that we can see the destinations for those two sectors, but the PCET\u00a0reforms give us an opportunity to do that right across the board. Huw, is there anything else I need to add?\nHuw Morris: Well, I'd just reinforce the point the Cabinet Secretary made about the fee and access plans being the vehicle through which\u00a0we get universities to specify what they're going to do, and the funding council tracks that. To make sure that we're doing that in a full and appropriate manner, periodically, we ask for that system to be reviewed. I think it was in 2017 that the\u00a0Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods\u2014the research arm of Cardiff University\u2014reviewed the system and looked at how widening access was being promoted by different institutions and whether that was working in all parts of Wales. The report from that group was considered by one of the sub-committees in HEFCW\u00a0and they are revising the process as a consequence. So, I think we can be confident that there are ambitious targets that are monitored, and, periodically, the system as a whole is reviewed.\nMichelle Brown AM: Can you tell us what sort of research and data the universities are basing those access plans on? I assume they'll all have slightly different methods\u2014I appreciate that\u2014but can you give us any idea of how they actually formulate these access plans?\nHuw Morris: So, there are data collected across the UK by a body called the Higher Education Statistics Agency. They produce detailed breakdowns, along with UCAS, of where applicants come from, which institutions did they study at, what courses, what their particular characteristics are, including their socioeconomic status, and that data is then analysed at a UK level and in Wales, through HEFCW\u00a0and its agents, to track what's happening at different institutions at different stages, not just in terms of who's applying and who gets access, but who progresses and what happens to people once they've graduated.\nMichelle Brown AM: So, there is already data there. I'm just wondering how that data that's already there differs from the research and analysis that you were talking about in your paper. They must be different, then. What specific analysis and research were you referring to in your paper?\nKirsty Williams AM: We use the HESA\u2014. It is HESA, isn't it?\nHuw Morris: Yes.\nKirsty Williams AM: That's shorthand\u2014the HESA data, and institutions use that. We also then use WISERD and other organisations to supplement that piece of work. I think there is a challenge to some of this going forward. So, the Office for Students in England now is having some discussions about access to HESA data. This is a source of real concern to me, that Welsh institutions may not be able to have the ready access to that data because of changes the OfS may be making. So, we supplement where we think that there's value to be added in additional breakdowns, or in additional slicing of data and understanding of what is motivating people to come forward.\nHuw Morris: And to give you a specific example of that as it applies in north Wales\u2014. So, take a university like Wrexham Glynd\u0175r University; they have quite a large intake of mature students. The data that's collected and analysed at a UK level tends to look at people who are going into university at a young age, not a mature profile. So, some of the analysis that we do in Wales\u2014indeed, the deliberations of the sub-committee that I spoke about earlier\u2014is about how do we make sure that those differences in Wales are reflected in the data and reflected in the targets that are set.\nMichelle Brown AM: Okay.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The next questions are from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Cabinet Secretary, are you in favour of more university mergers?\nKirsty Williams AM: I wouldn't use the word 'agnostic', but what I'm in favour of is a healthy, strong and sustainable HE sector. If individual institutions wish to collaborate or, indeed, go further to a formal merger then, obviously, that is a matter for them. We're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers, but, if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students, obviously, we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans, but that's a matter for individual institutions.\nHefin David AM: But HEFCW are pushing it.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, again, what HEFCW are interested in is a sustainable HE sector that is strong but, as I said, I do not have a burning desire or a set policy to try and pursue mergers.\nHefin David AM: Okay. That's a little bit of a contrast with your predecessors, then.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, that's a matter for them.\nHefin David AM: Okay. The reason I say it is because I was kind of on the inside when Cardiff Metropolitan University was under pressure from the then Minister to merge with the University of Glamorgan and Newport. It was a very difficult time for staff and, indeed, for students. You had the University and College Union and the Minister pushing it; the vice-chancellor of Cardiff Met at the time very much against it. So, do you think that it's really\u2014? You're agnostic, but do you think perhaps it's not worth the disruption that can occur to staff and students?\nKirsty Williams AM: As I said, Hefin, I have no formal policy for reconfiguration or mergers. That's not to say I don't believe in collaboration between institutions. Going back to the issue of ITE, a very interesting programme came forward from Cardiff Met and Cardiff University for their ITE provision. So, I'm all for universities and institutions working together, but there's no formal policy. These are autonomous institutions. If they see that there is an advantage\u2014I would hope for the student first, and, if we put the student at the front of this process, then we would obviously have an interest in that and making sure that that was the right thing to do. But, certainly, there is no pressure from us as a Government to pursue an agenda of mergers.\nHefin David AM: Just to be clear, then, that's likely to be a policy for the foreseeable future as well; you're not going to change that view.\nKirsty Williams AM: I have no intentions at this stage, but 'Events, dear boy'. [Laughter.] You know, sometimes\u00a0there may be a situation that I cannot foresee at this moment that would necessitate, for the benefit of students, the benefit of Wales, a merger. So, never say never, but, at this point in time, I do not foresee us changing that policy.\nLynne Neagle AM: Julie on this.\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, just looking back at that time, which I remember very vividly\u2014\nHefin David AM: So do I.\nJulie Morgan AM: I had many meetings with Cardiff Met. Do you feel there has been any disadvantage to Cardiff Met because that merger didn't go ahead?\nKirsty Williams AM: I, personally, am not aware\u00a0of any disadvantage to Cardiff Met, but I would recognise\u2014I would absolutely\u00a0recognise\u2014for staff and students caught up in those deliberations and those issues, then that would have had a personal impact on them. In terms of the institution going forward, I'm not aware that they are currently struggling with any disadvantage from that discussion. And, as I said, I'm really heartened\u00a0by some of the really interesting collaborative work that Cardiff Met are interested\u00a0in doing, and new partnerships and new collaborations between institutions, whether that be Cardiff Uni\u00a0or local colleges, and I think that's to be welcomed.\nJulie Morgan AM: So, following on from what Hefin said, was it worth all the fuss?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, look, as it's turned out, we have a strong institution\u00a0in Cardiff Met, and I think, rather than looking at the past, we need to look at the future. But, of course, there was some reconfiguration and we need to understand any lessons that arose out of reconfiguration, and HEFCW are currently doing\u00a0some work, actually, to look at reconfiguration, the experience of\u00a0reconfiguration that did happen, and were benefits realised\u00a0and what are the lessons that can be learned from that process. So, they are doing a piece of work to reflect, and that will, perhaps, help inform us as\u00a0we go forward.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Hefin.\nHefin David AM: I'd just say\u2014Julie Morgan was one of our heroes at the time, I've got to say.\nEluned Morgan AM: She always is.\nHefin David AM: And still is. If I turn that on its head and have a look at University of South Wales, one of the concerns I'm getting from former colleagues and staff is that the Newport aspect\u2014because it was\u00a0a merger between Newport and the University of Glamorgan\u2014has been somewhat denuded by the merger, and the amount of activity in the new Newport campus and elsewhere in Newport has been reduced by the merger. Are you aware of those concerns that staff may have?\nKirsty Williams AM: As I\u00a0said, it's not for me to second-guess the judgment of previous Ministers who pursued\u2014\nHefin David AM: But it's happening\u00a0now, I mean.\nKirsty Williams AM: \u2014a particular policy agenda. With regard to Newport, we are aware of concerns. Obviously, one campus closed completely, and there are concerns about the level of activity at the new campus. And we continue to discuss with the University of South Wales and the local FE college what offer is available to\u00a0the local population, but also the wider contribution that that institution can make to the rest of Wales, and we continue to have conversations with both\u00a0the college and the university about utilisation\u00a0of the facilities in Newport and opportunities that could be made available in Newport.\nHefin David AM: That's interesting, because\u00a0that's the first time I've heard it confirmed from the Government that those concerns that have been raised by former staff and colleagues in Newport are actually echoed\u00a0by yourself, then.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, as I said, we're aware of them. We take our time to listen to people. When people raise issues with us, we take them seriously. Clearly, going back to the point that I believe Suzy made about geographical coverage, we want to make sure that FE and HE opportunities are available for people throughout Wales, and\u00a0we continue to work with providers\u00a0in that area to explore\u00a0what can be done to enhance the opportunities.\nHefin David AM: And, from a financial point of view, they had \u00a325 million for the merger. Are you satisfied that's value for money, and, at this point in the 10-year plan, that things are going as they should, with incomes being squeezed across the sector?\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. I mean, it's difficult, isn't it, to second-guess what would have happened, what might have happened, if the merger hadn't gone ahead, around the financial stability and sustainability of an institution. How do you prove that, if that hadn't happened, something worse or something better\u00a0might have happened? It's difficult to do that and to second-guess those judgments, but, as I've said, what I am interested in\u2014. And I can't change that decision that was made by a previous Minister\u2014it wasn't my decision\u2014but what I can do is to ensure that any lessons learnt, any evaluation of that particular set of circumstances, can be looked at and can help inform future policy, which is why HEFCW is doing the piece of work. When that's published, you and I will be in a better position to understand whether the aspirations of that particular merger were realised, not realised, and if we were in that situation again, could we do it better next time?\nHefin David AM: Okay, so you'll reflect on that later. At this point in time, you don't have any concerns about the long-term sustainability of the University of South Wales.\nKirsty Williams AM: No, not at this point.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. The Welsh Government's draft outline budget for 2019 states that it will continue to provide \u00a320 million to further and higher education in 2019-20. Can you outline how this will be allocated between HE and FE and if conditions will be attached to the funding?\nKirsty Williams AM: Janet, you will have to wait until the end of the month, when the detailed, main expenditure group by main expenditure group lines of the budget are published, otherwise I will be stealing the finance Minister's thunder. There is a process by which the Welsh Government's budget is dealt with, and those details will emerge later on this month.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.\nKirsty Williams AM: But can I just say on conditions\u2014? You will be aware that there are conditions attached to Government spend, both in the FE sector and in the HE sector. Those budgets will be subject to those existing arrangements; so, for instance, in the HE sector, the remit letter to HEFCW.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Can I just pick up on funding, generally? Sorry. Because, we did talk about HEFCW\u00a0and part-time funding earlier, and I'm not sure that we addressed the issue of this \u00a312.5 million cut in a specific budget line from HEFCW, because what they've done, if I understand correctly, is that they've put four priorities into one budget line, which includes part-time teaching, and cut that budget line by \u00a312.5 million. Are you not concerned that that'll have an impact on part-time teaching, given that it's such a success story that you're proud of?\nKirsty Williams AM: HEFCW\u00a0have to take cognisance\u00a0of the remit letter, but then, ultimately, they are free to allocate resources as they see fit. What will drive part-time provision is the students taking it up, and universities responding to that desire and that need within their institutions. So, at this moment, I don't have any concerns.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to look at the parity of esteem between academic and vocational post-16 education. The first question is from Michelle.\nMichelle Brown AM: Thank you, Chair. Welsh Government wants to achieve parity of esteem between academic and vocational education, and I think that's a very laudable aim. Higher apprenticeships are a key part of this, but Estyn's recent inspection found that only four providers from 17 were achieving good outcomes for learners. What action do you propose to take about this, to make sure that those learners have much better outcomes across the board?\nEluned Morgan AM: First of all, just to make it clear that that is very much our intention. I think we have got work to do to make sure that we do reach that parity of esteem, but let's be clear that, in relation to these higher level apprenticeships, we were concerned that, actually, we weren't doing as well, perhaps, as we should be, which is why we commissioned Estyn to look at this specifically, and what it was that we were doing well, and what we needed to improve on. One of the things that we found is that we are doing very well in relation to foundation courses in terms of attainment\u2014we've got 83 per cent attainment levels\u2014but if you look at that at higher level apprenticeships, then we've got 77 per cent, so what is going wrong there? But, also, it's worth underlining the fact that, actually, we're still miles ahead of England, who are only reaching levels of about 61 per cent. So, we're already doing much better than England, but we're ambitious, and we want to make sure that if we are serious about this parity of esteem, how do we get there if we're not offering the kind of quality that we'd like to see in those higher level apprenticeships? So, some of the recommendations in that report, we'll be taking up. We want to increase the number of new employers\u00a0and mentors within the system. I think we're also very keen to make sure that people don't repeat learning that they've already done. That's a danger and it takes up too much time. So, there are lots of these recommendations that now we'll set in motion, and I think the important thing for us then is to understand that, in relation to who's doing well and who's not doing well in the FE sector, the bulk of where that finance goes is actually doing quite well. It's pushing some of the private sector providers where we need to actually make sure that the quality is where we want it to be, and is, very importantly, matching the needs of employers. So, we've constantly got to be looking at the courses: are they responding to the needs of the market and what employers are looking for? And that means revising the offer sometimes in terms of the courses.\nMichelle Brown AM: Where are the difficulties arising\u2014? You refer to difficulties arising with the private providers. What are those difficulties?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, some of it is about, perhaps, not giving the kind of guidance that we'd like them to give in-house. So, they're perhaps not doing the kind of on-the-job work that we'd like them to do. So, I think it's making sure that, when they're in the workplace, they are still being pushed to attain those levels. But I think it's clear that what we need to do is to also listen to what the advisory board that we've set up in relation to apprenticeships is also asking us, and we've got the Confederation of British Industry advising us on that as well.\nMichelle Brown AM: Do you have a service level agreement with the private providers?\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes. I mean, the whole thing is under a tender procedure, obviously, and we will be revising that soon. There'll be a new apprenticeship procurement process that we'll be undergoing and starting to look at that process next year. So, there's an opportunity there for us to drive change in the system.\nMichelle Brown AM: Would you be willing to share the targets under the SLA with the committee?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, I think the\u2014. I can't see that there'd be a problem with that, so I'm sure we could do that, but I think the way to make people move, quite often, is through making sure that you put the finances where they need to be, and then they're likely to shift. And, so, I think, in responding to this Estyn report, we can then build that into the next framework.\nMichelle Brown AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Julie.\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, thank you. Right, I wanted to ask about the investment. If we're going to get parity of esteem, we've got to, probably, get more investment in. Could you say why there isn't more investment in degree, and there doesn't seem to be any investment in Master's-level apprenticeships at universities?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, I think we've got to be careful that what happens is that the state doesn't pick up what, currently, people are prepared to pay for themselves, and, so, we've got to just make sure that that balance is right. So, what's happened in England, for example, is lots of people who were previously sitting Master of business administration courses, for example, are now switching into apprenticeship programmes. So, the system\u2014it means that, previously, they were prepared to pay and now the state is paying or the employer's playing it in a slightly different way. So, I think we've got to just be aware about how\u2014making sure that we don't get employers passing that responsibility that, actually, they have to upskill and to uptrain\u00a0their workers and pass it back on to the state, whereas, actually, they need to step up as well as employers.\nJulie Morgan AM: So, how are you going to judge that? How are you going to tell when, maybe, you should start putting some money in?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, what we are doing is we're putting money into areas where we know there are skills shortages. So, we're focusing where we want those apprenticeships\u2014and particularly at the higher level\u2014to be. So, for example, we're looking at ICT; we're looking at construction. There are\u00a0areas where we definitely need to be focusing our attention. So, that's where we'll be prioritising our funding, and that's what we're doing already.\nKirsty Williams AM: And that's for degree-level apprenticeships, not Master's. Just degree-level apprenticeships.\nJulie Morgan AM: Right, thank you. And then, in terms of getting data, could you clarify the progress on developing outcome and destination data for higher apprenticeships? Your plan seems to suggest that\u00a0data won't be available until 2020-21, at the end of the programme.\nEluned Morgan AM: And that's because we're only just starting on this, and it takes a long time for people to complete an apprenticeship. So, we won't have anybody going from the higher level apprenticeship into a destination until around 2021, so there's no point in measuring that until that point.\nJulie Morgan AM: Right. And then, can you tell us when you'll publish Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol's new operational plan to develop post-16 Welsh-medium provision, which was presented during July, and clarify if the plan requires additional funding?\nEluned Morgan AM: So, there is a report that was published in July, and we are waiting for the operational actions from that report to be published, probably within the next month. In terms of the implementation of that programme, some of that journey has already begun, so they're not waiting for the report to\u2014. We're not waiting for the actions to be very clearly set out; actually, some of that work has been done. For example, already, there's been a review of the governance. We're also looking at the kind of research that needs to be done in that area. I think what's clear, and something that's very much driving me as the Welsh language Minister, is this understanding that you reach 16 and you get this fall off a cliff in terms of the number of people who actually speak and use Welsh. So, that's the thing that we need to address, and that's why moving now into that area of further education is crucial. And the report, written by Delyth Evans, did suggest that we do need to move into this area but, actually, there wasn't necessarily a need for further funding in that area. But it may be something that we will consider, but it's something that we'll try and absorb, perhaps, from within the department.\nKirsty Williams AM: A relatively modest amount of money was being made available this year to be able to kick-start some of this work, but we are mindful of the recommendations from the Evans report. So, future allocations will have to reflect the priorities within the implementation plan, and that's not just money that goes directly to y\u00a0coleg, but also trying to get better alignment between other budget lines that support the Welsh language, and making sure that all budget lines that could help on this agenda are aligned to the recommendations and the implementation report.\nJulie Morgan AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Suzy, on this.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you. Just on\u00a0coleg cenedlaethol's extended remit, have you had\u2014? I haven't read the Evans report, but is there anything in there about the role of increased use of Welsh in adult community learning, for example? That's a further education pot, isn't it?\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes, it is, and we are very much in touch with adult community learning, and they are aware of the responsibilities they have in relation to the Welsh language. The issue, of course, with adult education, is that they have undergone some quite dramatic cuts.\nSuzy Davies AM: Oh, yes, I don't mean the higher education sector that's taken over responsibility for this; I'm talking about community learning, low level, just having Welsh there. And, you know, as you mentioned yourself, post 16, people stop using it, so getting it in wherever you can as part of a strategy.\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes. They're aware of that responsibility and we\u2014\nSuzy Davies AM: They're free to choose partners, then, are they, to help them deliver that?\nEluned Morgan AM: And also to work with the new organisation that we've set up to promote the learning of Welsh, in particular, that is based in Carmarthen. So, that's something also that's being driven, and they're working closely, I think, on this.\nSuzy Davies AM: Oh, great, thanks.\nKirsty Williams AM: There's lots of innovative practice. So, for instance, up in Wrexham, if a student has gone into the college to do A-levels, then they may decide to do those A-levels through the medium of English. But if they were previously in a Welsh-medium school, they are actively encouraged\u2014indeed, persuaded\u2014to do their Welsh baccalaureate through the medium of Welsh. So, they may be doing their A-levels in English, but if they've come from a Welsh-medium school, the college proactively seeks them out and makes sure that there is provision for them to do their Welsh bac qualification through the medium of Welsh, or, for instance, they are working very hard to form tutor groups. So, the tutor group\u2014you might be doing your qualifications in English, but your tutor group will be a Welsh-medium tutor group, so that you are placed\u00a0with other students who have come from Welsh-medium schools, and your tutor does all that tutor work through the medium of Welsh. So, there are other ways in which we can continue to help support children's linguistic ability, even if they have made a decision not to formally study their A-levels, for instance, or a course, through the medium of Welsh, and we're constantly looking at new ways. I think one particular aspect of the market\u2014if we call it that word\u2014that we're interested in are those students who've been to Welsh-medium schools, but at 16, perhaps, as I say, decide to go to a college. So, for instance, here in Cardiff, looking at childcare, and the opportunity\u2014you know, there's a sector where we know we need a Welsh-medium workforce.\nSuzy Davies AM: Yes, definitely.\nKirsty Williams AM: So, again, it's trying to target those children, and track them from a previous Welsh-medium education into a college, capturing their language skills, and finding ways in which they can use them. Merthyr college\u2014there's a Welsh-medium champion in Merthyr college actively looking for children who have come from a Welsh-medium background, and they are allocated roles as Welsh-medium champions within the college, to promote. So, there are lots of innovative ways, especially in the FE sector, that they're looking to keep children's linguistic skills relevant, and they're using them, even if they make that decision to switch the language of their tuition.\nSuzy Davies AM: Well, that's encouraging to hear. My question was about community learning, where it's essentially older people who perhaps are coming back to education in a way that wasn't as formal as it was before, if I can put it like that\u2014so we don't lose sight of them as well. I've still got an abiding worry that there's a cohort in the middle here of people who we might lose, and maybe pass on bad attitudes towards the Welsh language to their children, despite the fact that those children now have huge opportunities to absorb Welsh language skills and make the most of them.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. The next questions are from Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you, Chair. I'd like to ask about the regional skills partnership\u2014partnerships, I should say\u2014because they are having a direct influence now on courses and provision in FE, and with degree apprenticeships in universities as well. You, I believe, received the Graystone review back in March, so could you tell us a bit about what was in it, and what the recommendations are?\nEluned Morgan AM: So, some of the recommendations\u2014. So, we wanted to review it because it's still relatively new. They've only been up and running about two or three years. He brought out some positives\u2014things that we, I think, are doing well. I think they found that the voluntary partnership approach was quite effective. He did suggest that, actually, what they need to be producing is much shorter, sharper, focused reports. There was a suggestion of a lack of transparency, in terms of reporting from those regional skills partnerships, and that's obviously something now that we've undertaken to review. And there, I think, is an understanding that what we need to do now is to put in place those changes. But, on the whole, what we've done is to reinforce our commitment to the regional skills partnerships, and in particular now, through allocating \u00a310 million to further education colleges to respond directly to the wishes and the desires of the regional skills partnerships, you can see actually the status of the regional skills partnerships has just grown significantly. Because now there is an outcome as a result of their recommendations. So, you've seen quite a dramatic shift, I think, in the respect for regional skills partnerships over the past year.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, are there any recommendations in terms of governance as well\u2014\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: \u2014because, clearly, there may have been concerns about the way that people ended up being members of the partnerships? You touched on transparency\u2014clearly, that's an issue as well. So, just particularly on governance\u2014.\nEluned Morgan AM: So, on governance, I think there was an understanding that that needs to be looked at again, and that we need to get the right people around the table. And what is interesting is, I think, because it was a voluntary approach, because now people can see an outcome, we're getting different people now really showing an interest in being a part of the regional skills partnerships. So, governance is something again we're going to be addressing and following up the recommendations on in that Graystone review. Is there anything to add to that?\nHuw Morris: Well, I was just going to say, I don't see why we couldn't share the review with you.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: That was going to be my next question.\nHuw Morris: That might be helpful. And we are actioning the recommendations from that review.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The normal course of action would be, of course, to have published it and then to publish a Government response. Any reason why that wasn't done? I find it quite strange that you're saying that you're actually actioning the report and you still haven't published it. As a committee, we've not been party to any of that, really.\nEluned Morgan AM: I don't see why that can't be done. There's nothing to hide here, so why wouldn't we? We're the people who commissioned the report\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: I'm the one asking the questions. [Laughter.] No, but you're right. I just find it strange. I just find it odd that that hasn't been published.\nEluned Morgan AM: Okay. Well, we'll certainly get a copy of that to you.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, okay.\nHuw Morris: May I just\u00a0say: we ask a number of people periodically to comment on what we do, and agencies we work with do the same. The status of those reports varies. I don't suppose we'd anticipated there would be the interest in this issue that there is and so, as the Minister said, there's no problem that I can see with that.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: And do you have a timeline in terms of by when you want to introduce some of the reforms that you're looking at now, because of this report?\nEluned Morgan AM: Some of them have already been introduced, so we're not waiting. The transparency issue that I think there was a bit of concern about\u2014that's already been introduced. So, it's just about making sure that people understand what is going on in these regional skills partnerships. I think that's really important\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Well, quite, given the influence that they have\u00a0now. Yes, sure. Just another short one on the regional skills partnerships, really: how effective are they in supporting the planning and delivery of Welsh-medium provision in post-16?\nEluned Morgan AM: I think there's more we can do in relation to that. But I think there are aspects where we're already changing in respect of specific\u00a0sectors. So, if you think about the care sector, for example, what we do need is more people\u00a0who have those skills to speak through the medium of Welsh in the\u00a0care sector. And, coming back to the point that was made earlier, what we're doing now is looking at the curriculum: to what extent can we include\u2014? You don't have to do your whole course through the medium of Welsh, but there are aspects that would be very useful. So, those kind of things are being taken on board now in terms of the courses. One of the things that the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol are looking at is building the resources that will be needed in order to mainstream those into, in particular, those\u00a0front-line service areas where we have a skills shortage.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Cabinet Secretary, you know that\u00a0this committee has taken a very keen interest in the emotional and mental health of our young people. In the summer, the English universities Minister made an announcement about the development of a new mental health charter. That followed some concerns about young people\u00a0dying by suicide across the UK. Is Welsh Government expecting Welsh universities to sign up to that charter or are you planning to work on your own?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you for raising this. I think it's really important that whilst for many, many, many young people moving away from home and starting their degree course is an incredibly exciting time and something they look forward to hugely, it can bring significant stresses with it, especially for first-year students, who, as I said, are moving away, perhaps are suddenly responsible for finances in a way they've never been responsible for, for all the day-to-day living that perhaps they've relied on other people to assist them with. So, it can be quite a stressful time. So, it is right that we look at how we can support health and well-being for students, especially mental health and mental resilience. So, I very much welcome the work on the mental health\u00a0charter, and HEFCW\u00a0are engaged and keeping a very close eye on what's going on to see the opportunities for Welsh universities to participate in that. But this was on a recent agenda item that I had with HEFCW, and indeed with the\u00a0vice-chancellors, when I met them last week, or the week before last. So, they are developing their own strategic approach to well-being and health for students, which will be underpinned by a co-created action plan with the universities themselves on supporting students\u00a0with mental health problems in particular. So, the strategic approach and the\u00a0action plan are being developed by HEFCW\u00a0at the moment and HEFCW\u00a0are also meeting with colleagues from England and Scotland to see the opportunities for a universal approach across the UK to supporting students. The universities, when I met with them recently, all shared a commitment to do better in this particular area. One, because it's the right thing to do, but, actually,\u00a0stopping people from dropping out and not completing their courses obviously is of a financial benefit\u00a0to the institution. So, it's actually the right thing to do for their students, they want to do it for that reason, but, actually, there is a strong financial underpinning to ensure that students complete their studies. So, it's looking at, again, each university looking at individual approaches of how better they can do that. But it's not just responding to students who become unwell, it's\u00a0actually, 'What can we do to in the campus to maintain\u00a0good mental health?' So, rather than just trying to fix a problem once it's occurred, it's 'What can we do?' And you'll be aware of individual institutions\u00a0taking different approaches. It's not something that we dictate, but individual institutions\u2014when they do exams, how work is assessed and marked and graded\u2014are taking different steps to promote well-being, as well as then responding to situations where students become unwell. We do know that financial pressures can be a source of huge stress for students, so we are constantly working with the Student Loans Company to make sure that the services that they offer to people are as good as they can be, and that there are no unnecessary delays that, perhaps, put a student under pressure or give students worries about their financial situation. And I would argue our Diamond reforms, which allow students\u00a0access to a living wage\u2014for some students, completely by a grant, for some students, a combination of grant and loan, with no expectation at\u00a0all that your parents\u00a0will contribute, which is not the case in\u00a0other places where there is an expectation of parental contribution\u2014that actually, hopefully, addresses some of those financial worries that some students may have. But I am aware that if people are waiting for their grant or people are waiting\u00a0for their payments, that can be a source of stress. So, ensuring that we have good performance by the Student Loans Company is crucial.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And I'm sure the committee's very interested to hear the update on that. Are you able to give us any indication of timescale\u00a0by which you'd expect HEFCW\u00a0and the individual universities to actually have this work in place?\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm not sure, but I will write to the committee and let you know. In fact, we can probably provide, from Universities Wales and from the work that's going on centrally, a list of\u00a0proposals that are being undertaken.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much. The next question is from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. I wanted to ask you about the pay dispute, and I know that you're not the employer, because\u00a0I know that's going to be the first answer\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM: You're right, that is the first answer. [Laughter.] Well anticipated.\nDawn Bowden AM: But we are in a stalemate here and you clearly have an interest in making sure that this dispute is resolved quickly\u00a0in the interest of the students and the reputation of the colleges et cetera, et\u00a0cetera. I can see how this dispute has arisen. When we've seen the teachers' pay settlement, we've seen FE settlements in England and Scotland higher than what's\u00a0on the table here. And I am concerned, and I do think this is where the Welsh Government does have a role, because\u00a0I am concerned that the employers seem to be using the funding issue as the reason not to have a reasonable settlement with staff. So, they've walked away from the table, they've said, 'One per cent, take it or leave it. Unless Welsh Government gives us any more money, that's the end of that.' And I'm really concerned about that, because\u00a0this is potentially going to have a major impact on whether we can recruit\u00a0and retain staff in FE colleges. And I look at the college in my constituency, Merthyr\u00a0college\u2014it's a tertiary college, they're providing A-level education across Merthyr\u00a0and they're astounding results they've been getting as well. I'm coming round to the question in a moment. It's really: what more do you think you can do as a Government to try to get these parties back round the table and not allow the dispute to become a political football?\nEluned Morgan AM: Thanks very much for that. I think, first of all, you're absolutely right\u2014this is about ColegauCymru's negotiation, but we are keeping a close eye on the situation. I think it's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about, or part of the reason, is because\u00a0you've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers' pay and we've had the consequential. So, sixth-form teachers are happy. The people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution, you can understand why they may say, 'Something needs to change here.' The problem here is that it's about that, actually, that falls to the Welsh Government. We don't have that. Or at least it falls to FE colleges to fund that,\u00a0and it's up to them to come up with that proposal. We are keeping a close eye on things. I think it's fair to say that we'll wait until they get further along down the line, but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you for that, Minister. When you say you're keeping a close eye on it, have you actually had conversations with ColegauCymru? Because I note what you just said there:\u00a0'We'll keep an eye on it and wait and see what's happening.' Well, all the unions are currently consulting. One has already balloted for industrial action. We could have the other unions also balloting for industrial action. I mean, this isn't something we want in the FE sector, clearly, so is there anything more proactive that Government could actually be doing to try to bring a resolution to this dispute?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we are listening and speaking to ColegauCymru, and also we're aware of what the unions are saying as well. So, I think that's probably as far as we can go at this point. When they come to a conclusion, and when they come to us and say, 'Look, this is the consequence and this will finish'\u2014at this point, we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you.\u00a0Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, thank you. Yes, we wouldn't expect you to make an announcement on this, because it's happening outside of Government, but there is a principle here, isn't there, in terms of pay equality between schoolteachers and FE? So, would you not wish to see a situation where we do have greater equality in that respect?\nEluned Morgan AM: In relation to teaching, I think it's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching, yes.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay, thank you. You emphasise\u00a0'in relation to teaching'\u2014my next question is that, of course, within FE establishments you have teaching staff and non-teaching staff, and if there was to be some sort of increase, then would you not expect all staff to have that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, let's see\u2014that's up to ColegauCymru\u00a0to negotiate and to discuss, so let's see what the outcomes are.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Because some of the non-teaching staff are the lowest paid, as well, aren't they? So, you know\u2014.\nEluned Morgan AM: Let's wait for the outcome of the negotiations. I think we are very aware of the situation. ColegauCymru are in that negotiation. We're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members, and we'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Could I just briefly as well ask about pensions, because that's coming down the line, potentially, isn't it, and the impact that's going to have on FE? One college was saying it will cost them \u00a31 million if it happens next year. Are you thinking about any steps that you could take to support them, potentially, because obviously this is coming down the line, really, isn't it?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, I think, already, we've got the situation in relation to teachers, and again what we've seen is the consequential and the UK Government honouring that. Again, what we don't have, necessarily, is that money coming down from the UK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or \u00a310.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from\u00a0Professor Colin Riordan\u00a0on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter\u2014it was actually to me\u2014that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give\u00a0me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity\u2014. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put\u2014. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed\u00a0centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites\u00a0that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.]\u00a0My understanding is\u2014\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee\u2014. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites\u00a0say to you, 'Unless\u00a0you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system\u2014some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself\u2014\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did\u2014a student deliberately\u00a0went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just\u2014final question\u2014with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private.\u00a0Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group discuss about the trend of teacher recruiting and the reasons for it, and steps they had taken?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the group discuss about the trend of teacher recruiting and the reasons for it, and steps they had taken?", "context": "Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is\u00a0a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now \u00a320,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE\u00a0recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want\u00a0to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?\nKirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me\u2014what the research does show\u2014that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim\u00a0Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state\u2014significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner\u2014it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status\u2014so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that\u2014there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'\u2014actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE\u00a0route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE\u00a0is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important\u2014that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside\u00a0Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'm very keen to increase the diversity in our teaching workforce and I'm very keen in looking at career changers, who perhaps have different life experience and work experience, coming into our teaching profession.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that. Part of that diversity, of course\u2014it would be great if you had more people interested in qualifying to teach through the medium of Welsh. Great aspirations; the trend's going the other way. No-one can solve this in 280 characters, I get that, but can you give us some indication about why you think this is proving still such an unattractive option when it's clear that there's a policy for this country to improve the number of Welsh speakers? You'd have thought there'd be a pretty good carrot for this.\nKirsty Williams AM: Sure. Again, data for recruitment for the 2018-19 cohort is not yet available and we are, as I said, keeping in touch with our ITE\u00a0centres to keep a close eye on them. I think an important thing to recognise is that there is a difference between the number of people who are on courses where there is a specific designation that enables them to teach through the medium of Welsh and those people who have linguistic ability and Welsh ability but don't necessarily do a course that allows them. So, there is a difference. We do think that, for the 2016-17 cohort, there were an additional 130 qualifiers\u00a0that, actually, were fluent in Welsh and who could have gone on to teach in Welsh-medium schools, didn't necessarily do a course that gave them that designation. But, clearly, we've got three academic years now to get to the targets that we've set ourselves. The evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in ITE reported at the end of last month, and the Minister and officials are busy working now to implement the recommendations of the report that was published, I think, on 28 September, to be able to move this agenda forward. Again, we've got new incentives, this year, both for people starting their course and then for teachers who complete their QTS after a year. So, we've added in new financial incentives this year to try and address some of those issues. But, clearly, these are ambitious targets and we will need to have a step change over the next three years if we're to meet them.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you for that, Cabinet Secretary. Thank you for that answer. We're now talking about cohorts of students coming into\u00a0PGCE and teaching degrees. If they're from Wales, they will have had Welsh as part of their education from day one, and we'll accept there are varying\u00a0qualities in different parts of Wales, different attitudes towards it as well. But there isn't a single a person now who's been through Welsh education who can say they have no Welsh at all, unless they've moved into the system\u00a0from, say, England very, very recently. What is being done within the teaching qualifications, including the degrees, to ensure that, at least in Welsh universities, those nascent Welsh language skills are at least kept alive, even though we're not talking necessarily about being at a level where people can teach through the medium? It's\u00a0the age-old question: once the school gate closes, is that the end of their Welsh use? So, is there something\u2014it won't be Donaldson, but in the teacher training qualifications\u2014that is keeping this going and, hopefully, increasing the usability of the Welsh skills they have?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, in terms of how we can encourage children who have got Welsh skills as a result of their education up to 16, how they can\u00a0continue to use those skills and, potentially, use them in the workplace, I'm sure Eluned will want to talk about\u00a0some of the work, for instance, in other, non-teaching sectors. But, with regard to ITE, you'll be aware that, in the evaluation report, as I said, that was published, the report comes forward with two options in how we could develop an intervention programme to support Welsh language\u00a0skills\u00a0amongst all primary and secondary ITE\u00a0entrants. So, what we'll be doing now as a result of that report is that we'll be working very closely with our ITE\u00a0centres\u00a0to develop and agree upon minimum provision that constitutes those skill levels within ITE\u00a0provision for all teachers.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: You have your targets for 2021, in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system, which is positive, although, clearly, the report or the review itself said that, actually, we need to double the numbers, really. But it's not just the trends that are going down; it's a cataclysmic drop, really. We've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh. So, it's a huge turnaround that we're looking for, and I'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you're giving here this morning\u00a0reflect the level of action that's\u00a0needed, really.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, first of all, as I tried to illustrate to Suzy, the figures on their\u00a0own\u00a0tell one story, but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak Welsh and to be able to use\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: I think it's\u00a040 per cent\u00a0of those who are currently in the system who don't\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM: \u2014the language and skills. And if we look at qualifiers of ITE courses in Wales by degree type, actually, we see a different trend\u2014we see numbers going up. So, there are statistics and there are statistics. Depending on which ones you look at, it's quite a complex picture. And that's why we had the evaluation report. We understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done. That's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ITE\u00a0and that's why we'll be taking that ambition\u00a0forward. We know what we need to do. As I said, we're not sitting back and hoping\u00a0that something miraculous will change things. We are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you for that. Clearly, there are statistics\u00a0and there are statistics, so could you just explain to us which statistics you've used for your targets for growth over the next three years?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you're projecting?\nKirsty Williams AM: We're using the baseline of 2012-13. There has been a decline since then.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: That's the one I was using when I said '24 per cent reduction'.\nKirsty Williams AM: There has been a decline in those numbers. That's why, as I said, we're doing the work that we need to do to reverse that decline. In using those numbers, we also know that there are additional people in the system who are not captured in those figures and who do have the linguistic ability to use their language positively in school settings. So, what I'm saying is that that doesn't tell us the whole story, but I will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ITE providers to ensure that we will have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions, and I'm not hiding from that.\nEluned Morgan AM: Also, I just think it's worth saying that a lot of this is about building the confidence of those people who actually can speak Welsh, who are not teaching through the medium of Welsh, and to give them that support. First of all, we need to identify who these people are, so there is a job of work being undertaken now in terms of registration in particular\u2014when people register, let's just make sure that we collect that kind of data.\nKirsty Williams AM: We don't even do that consistently at the moment. One of the recommendations of the report is that there is no consistent approach to understanding this baseline data and there's no consistent competency test that people start at the beginning of their course, so we need a national approach rather than leaving it to individual institutions.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Have we missed any tricks, potentially, in terms of the reforms to accrediting ITE, for example, in terms of, maybe, strengthening aspects around the Welsh language and provision in that respect?\nKirsty Williams AM: No, I don't believe so. The accreditation process, which is independent of the Government\u2014the accreditation process demands of our ITE\u00a0providers that their provision will be able to meet the goals of our curriculum. Our curriculum is very clear about the equality of the language and the ability of our children, through all stages of their education journey, to be able to be bilingual children.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, that requirement, as far you're concerned, is there.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, okay. Diolch\u2014thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Before I turn to Hefin, can I just clarify\u2014? In answer to Suzy Davies, you said that 65 per cent of the places in Welsh training centres\u00a0had been filled. Is that 65 per cent of the priority places?\nKirsty Williams AM: Priority places.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nKirsty Williams AM: Sixty-five per cent of the priority courses are being met.\nLynne Neagle AM: Lovely, thank you for clarifying that. Hefin.\nHefin David AM: The decision by the Education\u00a0Workforce Council\u00a0not to accredit the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training\u2014what are your views and concerns about that?\nKirsty Williams AM: The process is independent of Government, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that, especially as I understand that there is an appeals process that may be being undertaken. What I would say is that from the very outset of our ITE\u00a0reforms we have made it very clear that I expect very high standards in our ITE\u00a0system, but the process is independent of this Government. I have confidence in the people who have been appointed by the EWC\u00a0to undertake that process, but it is independent of me, and it's not appropriate for me to comment on that further.\nHefin David AM: I fully understand that and the need for distance for the EWC, but there'll be an impact on students and staff. Students, first of all: are you concerned that the reduction in providers might have an impact on students, and those students going through the second year at USW? Would you have concerns about that issue?\nKirsty Williams AM: In terms of the overall numbers, we will be looking to commission from those institutions that have been accredited the number of training places that our planning tool says that we need. So, in terms of an overall number of places, we will commission from those accredited units. Clearly, there will be a responsibility upon the University of South Wales to ensure that those students already in the system are able to complete their studies and their course, with the appropriate level of support and tuition to enable them to achieve their career aspirations and to graduate from that programme.\nHefin David AM: And what about the uncertainty for staff, or would you say that's an issue for the university itself?\nKirsty Williams AM: These are autonomous bodies. They have to act accordingly, in compliance with any employment law or any statutory responsibilities that they would have as an employer. That's not a matter for me; that is a matter for the institution that is an autonomous body.\nHefin David AM: But I would be surprised if you weren't keeping an eye on this, given that it has been a key provider. Are you aware of when the appeal decision will be known?\nKirsty Williams AM: My understanding is that the appeals process is ongoing, and next month, perhaps. But as I said, this is a process that is independent of Government\u2014\nHefin David AM: But it will have an impact for what you do.\nKirsty Williams AM: It will potentially change the nature of the people from whom we commission places, but as I said, I do not have any concerns that we will not be in a position to commission the appropriate number of training places that we will need as a result of our planning.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy on this\u2014mindful of what the Minister said about it being an independent decision.\nSuzy Davies AM: It's not directly about USW; it's about the geographic spread of provision. I wonder if you could just give us a snapshot of what that looks like, and whether you think\u2014certainly for PGCE or postgrad courses, anyway\u2014that if they're not accessible geographically and we've got students who already have three years' worth of debt, they're not going to be looking to, necessarily, live away from home for a fourth year, and may want to study nearer home. Has there been any research done on the access to these postgrad\u00a0courses, about where people are coming from and whether that's had an impact on the fact that some of these places haven't been filled?\nKirsty Williams AM: Currently, with our current providers, there is a significant geographical spread. There are centres here in the south-east, there are centres\u00a0in the south-west, in mid Wales, and in north Wales. Obviously, accessibility is an issue for us. We do think that, for some students, accessibility is an issue, and of course that's why we are responding with our part-time PGCE\u00a0route, which actually will be location neutral, because you will be able to study that as a distance learner, and so you will be able to remain in your community and undertake that course. So, that's part of the attractiveness, I believe, of offering that to people. So, if geographical disadvantage is stopping somebody from pursuing a career aspiration to qualify as a teacher, our new part-time PGCE, as I said, will allow them to do that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Thanks, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to talk about reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector. Janet Finch-Saunders.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Good morning. There are some encouraging provisional signs regarding the demand for part-time undergraduate study for the first year of Diamond, but the \u00a312.5 million reduction\u00a0Higher Education Funding Council for Wales\u00a0is having to make this academic year has potentially placed the funding for part-time provision under pressure. Is there a danger that, without maintaining and growing this funding, Welsh Government will undermine the Diamond reforms and increase the cost of part-time courses?\nKirsty Williams AM: Let's be absolutely clear what this Government has done for part-time students. We are unique, Janet: unique in the UK and, I believe, unique in Europe, in the parity of the support that is available for full-time and part-time students. So, Welsh part-timers have something that they do not get if they are in England or if they're in Scotland. It's too early to have definitive figures for the impact of Diamond on the number of people who are undertaking part-time study. I don't want to get into trouble by not having that verified data, and I know Members get testy with me for anecdotal evidence, but I can tell you this: there is one provider that is reporting at this moment a 40 per cent increase in the number of students that are registered to start part-time study with them this year, as compared to last year, and that reflects really, really well, compared to the onward downward trend that we see across the border for part-time. What this means, for us as a nation, is that people are able to take this opportunity to upskill themselves and to be able to develop their qualifications and to be able to move themselves up career ladders, and I think that's such an important economic factor for us. So, rather than feeling doom and gloom about the prospects for the part-time sector, the early indications, at least, show that the Diamond reforms are leading to an increase in demand and, more importantly, an increase in uptake\u2014students taking advantage of that system to go away and study.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Is the Welsh Government able to reassure the committee that its ambitions for the post-compulsory education and training\u00a0reforms are still in line with the original Hazelkorn recommendations, and go beyond the Labour manifesto commitment of simply replacing HEFCW with a new funding body for HE and FE?\nKirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, you will be aware, Janet, that the agreement between myself and the First Minister that brought me into the Government and the Government's programme state very clearly about our desire to pursue the recommendations of the Hazelkorn report. I hope, by the end of this week, we will have published the responses to the technical consultation, and we will continue to move forward. And I would argue, certainly, that the reforms that we are intending to implement do go beyond just simply a body that replaces HEFCW and joins in FE. It's a much wider remit to the potential new commission. And, as I said, I believe we've had in the region of about 450 responses to the technical consultation and I'm pleased to say that there remains a consensus\u2014we will always have some arguments about the details\u2014but there remains a consensus on the direction of travel that we are pursuing. A summary of the consultation responses will be available to Members and will be published by the end of the week.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. Is the Welsh Government still committed to introducing the PCET Bill before the end of the fifth Assembly, and are you confident this will happen?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, I'm absolutely determined that we will get the PCET legislation on the floor. It's a substantial piece of work, as you've just alluded to. This goes just beyond abolishing a single body. So, it is a substantial piece of work, but I believe that we are on track to be able to do that by the end of this term. But it's a big piece of work.\nLynne Neagle AM: Llyr, on this.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Can I just pick up on that? I mean, it is going to be a big job, and, clearly, there's a strong focus on creating the commission and putting the structures in place, but, of course, one of the drivers is that we want to effect a cultural change in the way that people perceive post-16 education. This thing about parity of esteem and all that kind of agenda. And a key part of this process, therefore, is the vision that people are waiting for. When are we going to see this coming forward? Because I think we're putting structures in place, so there's a big discussion about the technical stuff, but I feel there's a bit of a vacuum\u00a0in terms of the vision.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, I would disagree with you, Llyr, because\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Right, okay. Well, maybe you should have come to the cross-party group on further education last night.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, I would disagree with you because, of course, the technical consultation has followed what we had last year, which was a consultation on the vision, on what we needed to do to bring the sector together beyond just HE and FE, to the inclusion of sixth forms; work-based learning providers; apprenticeships; and bringing all of that together under one body. I believe that that gives us an opportunity to have better strategic planning; to help us prevent duplication; to help us bridge gaps that are not available for learners at the moment. It will, hopefully\u2014. My vision is that it will promote collaboration between institutions rather than simply having the market-based process that we see in other places where there's competition rather than collaboration. I want to see it strengthen links between schools, FE and HE, strengthen links between schools and employers and business, to make sure that we've got better information and advice services so that young people know what their pathways are and can make really informed choices about what's best for them, to help them make them. So, I think: we've done the vision, we're now doing the technical consultation, that will be published by the end of the week, and we'll move forward with our overarching vision that Hazelkorn elaborated and that we are now taking forward.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, you would be very concerned if FE institutions were saying that we really need to see the vision, that that's the next step, that we really need to understand the vision.\nKirsty Williams AM: But, I've met\u2014. As I said, I was with one of our excellent FE leaders\u00a0just at the end of last week; it wasn't raised with me then. I do understand that there are concerns from the FE sector about will the vision be realised. I think there's a shared understanding of the vision, but I understand and I\u00a0do see some nervousness about, actually, in the end, will this just be HEFCW by another name, and, the opportunity for FE, will this be realised in this new body? We need to keep ensuring that, as we go forward and develop the policy, and as we develop, eventually, the legislation, that that parity of esteem and that true equality across all parts of the sector is realised.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. Our next questions are from Michelle Brown.\nMichelle Brown AM: Good morning, Cabinet Secretary; good morning, Minister. Your paper to the committee says that there's a need for more analysis and research into the outcomes for learners from different backgrounds. At the same time, Welsh universities have declared \u00a3104 million towards equality and opportunity activity for 2018. If you don't have the analysis, how can you be sure that the investment that's being made by the Welsh universities is actually going to have a positive outcome in the right places and lead to better outcomes for underrepresented groups?\nKirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, of course, that would be one of the duties of the new commission set up as a result of our\u00a0post-compulsory education and training reforms that I would anticipate. The universities are required, under the\u00a0Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015, to produce fee and access statements, and the \u00a3104 million that they have to take off their fees to be able to promote this work\u2014those fee and access plans have to be signed off by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales as being robust and truly promoting equality of opportunity. They're also there to promote access and the opportunities for people to aspire to higher education. We are looking at\u2014.\u00a0It's quite early days, still, for that new regulatory regime to come through, so we ask HEFCW, when I meet with HEFCW, about the adequacy of those plans. Equity is an important part of my approach to higher education. That's why we're introducing the Diamond reforms\u2014so that those from the poorest backgrounds can be adequately financially supported and are not put off from going to a university. And we're also looking\u2014. I would envisage under PCET a better mechanism of tracking destinations for learners. So, for instance, in the FE sector, we're introducing new joint monitoring for outcomes for sixth-form learners and FE learners, because we've never tracked them in the same way. So, we're introducing that now so that we can see the destinations for those two sectors, but the PCET\u00a0reforms give us an opportunity to do that right across the board. Huw, is there anything else I need to add?\nHuw Morris: Well, I'd just reinforce the point the Cabinet Secretary made about the fee and access plans being the vehicle through which\u00a0we get universities to specify what they're going to do, and the funding council tracks that. To make sure that we're doing that in a full and appropriate manner, periodically, we ask for that system to be reviewed. I think it was in 2017 that the\u00a0Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods\u2014the research arm of Cardiff University\u2014reviewed the system and looked at how widening access was being promoted by different institutions and whether that was working in all parts of Wales. The report from that group was considered by one of the sub-committees in HEFCW\u00a0and they are revising the process as a consequence. So, I think we can be confident that there are ambitious targets that are monitored, and, periodically, the system as a whole is reviewed.\nMichelle Brown AM: Can you tell us what sort of research and data the universities are basing those access plans on? I assume they'll all have slightly different methods\u2014I appreciate that\u2014but can you give us any idea of how they actually formulate these access plans?\nHuw Morris: So, there are data collected across the UK by a body called the Higher Education Statistics Agency. They produce detailed breakdowns, along with UCAS, of where applicants come from, which institutions did they study at, what courses, what their particular characteristics are, including their socioeconomic status, and that data is then analysed at a UK level and in Wales, through HEFCW\u00a0and its agents, to track what's happening at different institutions at different stages, not just in terms of who's applying and who gets access, but who progresses and what happens to people once they've graduated.\nMichelle Brown AM: So, there is already data there. I'm just wondering how that data that's already there differs from the research and analysis that you were talking about in your paper. They must be different, then. What specific analysis and research were you referring to in your paper?\nKirsty Williams AM: We use the HESA\u2014. It is HESA, isn't it?\nHuw Morris: Yes.\nKirsty Williams AM: That's shorthand\u2014the HESA data, and institutions use that. We also then use WISERD and other organisations to supplement that piece of work. I think there is a challenge to some of this going forward. So, the Office for Students in England now is having some discussions about access to HESA data. This is a source of real concern to me, that Welsh institutions may not be able to have the ready access to that data because of changes the OfS may be making. So, we supplement where we think that there's value to be added in additional breakdowns, or in additional slicing of data and understanding of what is motivating people to come forward.\nHuw Morris: And to give you a specific example of that as it applies in north Wales\u2014. So, take a university like Wrexham Glynd\u0175r University; they have quite a large intake of mature students. The data that's collected and analysed at a UK level tends to look at people who are going into university at a young age, not a mature profile. So, some of the analysis that we do in Wales\u2014indeed, the deliberations of the sub-committee that I spoke about earlier\u2014is about how do we make sure that those differences in Wales are reflected in the data and reflected in the targets that are set.\nMichelle Brown AM: Okay.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The next questions are from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: Cabinet Secretary, are you in favour of more university mergers?\nKirsty Williams AM: I wouldn't use the word 'agnostic', but what I'm in favour of is a healthy, strong and sustainable HE sector. If individual institutions wish to collaborate or, indeed, go further to a formal merger then, obviously, that is a matter for them. We're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers, but, if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students, obviously, we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans, but that's a matter for individual institutions.\nHefin David AM: But HEFCW are pushing it.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, again, what HEFCW are interested in is a sustainable HE sector that is strong but, as I said, I do not have a burning desire or a set policy to try and pursue mergers.\nHefin David AM: Okay. That's a little bit of a contrast with your predecessors, then.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, that's a matter for them.\nHefin David AM: Okay. The reason I say it is because I was kind of on the inside when Cardiff Metropolitan University was under pressure from the then Minister to merge with the University of Glamorgan and Newport. It was a very difficult time for staff and, indeed, for students. You had the University and College Union and the Minister pushing it; the vice-chancellor of Cardiff Met at the time very much against it. So, do you think that it's really\u2014? You're agnostic, but do you think perhaps it's not worth the disruption that can occur to staff and students?\nKirsty Williams AM: As I said, Hefin, I have no formal policy for reconfiguration or mergers. That's not to say I don't believe in collaboration between institutions. Going back to the issue of ITE, a very interesting programme came forward from Cardiff Met and Cardiff University for their ITE provision. So, I'm all for universities and institutions working together, but there's no formal policy. These are autonomous institutions. If they see that there is an advantage\u2014I would hope for the student first, and, if we put the student at the front of this process, then we would obviously have an interest in that and making sure that that was the right thing to do. But, certainly, there is no pressure from us as a Government to pursue an agenda of mergers.\nHefin David AM: Just to be clear, then, that's likely to be a policy for the foreseeable future as well; you're not going to change that view.\nKirsty Williams AM: I have no intentions at this stage, but 'Events, dear boy'. [Laughter.] You know, sometimes\u00a0there may be a situation that I cannot foresee at this moment that would necessitate, for the benefit of students, the benefit of Wales, a merger. So, never say never, but, at this point in time, I do not foresee us changing that policy.\nLynne Neagle AM: Julie on this.\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, just looking back at that time, which I remember very vividly\u2014\nHefin David AM: So do I.\nJulie Morgan AM: I had many meetings with Cardiff Met. Do you feel there has been any disadvantage to Cardiff Met because that merger didn't go ahead?\nKirsty Williams AM: I, personally, am not aware\u00a0of any disadvantage to Cardiff Met, but I would recognise\u2014I would absolutely\u00a0recognise\u2014for staff and students caught up in those deliberations and those issues, then that would have had a personal impact on them. In terms of the institution going forward, I'm not aware that they are currently struggling with any disadvantage from that discussion. And, as I said, I'm really heartened\u00a0by some of the really interesting collaborative work that Cardiff Met are interested\u00a0in doing, and new partnerships and new collaborations between institutions, whether that be Cardiff Uni\u00a0or local colleges, and I think that's to be welcomed.\nJulie Morgan AM: So, following on from what Hefin said, was it worth all the fuss?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, look, as it's turned out, we have a strong institution\u00a0in Cardiff Met, and I think, rather than looking at the past, we need to look at the future. But, of course, there was some reconfiguration and we need to understand any lessons that arose out of reconfiguration, and HEFCW are currently doing\u00a0some work, actually, to look at reconfiguration, the experience of\u00a0reconfiguration that did happen, and were benefits realised\u00a0and what are the lessons that can be learned from that process. So, they are doing a piece of work to reflect, and that will, perhaps, help inform us as\u00a0we go forward.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, Hefin.\nHefin David AM: I'd just say\u2014Julie Morgan was one of our heroes at the time, I've got to say.\nEluned Morgan AM: She always is.\nHefin David AM: And still is. If I turn that on its head and have a look at University of South Wales, one of the concerns I'm getting from former colleagues and staff is that the Newport aspect\u2014because it was\u00a0a merger between Newport and the University of Glamorgan\u2014has been somewhat denuded by the merger, and the amount of activity in the new Newport campus and elsewhere in Newport has been reduced by the merger. Are you aware of those concerns that staff may have?\nKirsty Williams AM: As I\u00a0said, it's not for me to second-guess the judgment of previous Ministers who pursued\u2014\nHefin David AM: But it's happening\u00a0now, I mean.\nKirsty Williams AM: \u2014a particular policy agenda. With regard to Newport, we are aware of concerns. Obviously, one campus closed completely, and there are concerns about the level of activity at the new campus. And we continue to discuss with the University of South Wales and the local FE college what offer is available to\u00a0the local population, but also the wider contribution that that institution can make to the rest of Wales, and we continue to have conversations with both\u00a0the college and the university about utilisation\u00a0of the facilities in Newport and opportunities that could be made available in Newport.\nHefin David AM: That's interesting, because\u00a0that's the first time I've heard it confirmed from the Government that those concerns that have been raised by former staff and colleagues in Newport are actually echoed\u00a0by yourself, then.\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, as I said, we're aware of them. We take our time to listen to people. When people raise issues with us, we take them seriously. Clearly, going back to the point that I believe Suzy made about geographical coverage, we want to make sure that FE and HE opportunities are available for people throughout Wales, and\u00a0we continue to work with providers\u00a0in that area to explore\u00a0what can be done to enhance the opportunities.\nHefin David AM: And, from a financial point of view, they had \u00a325 million for the merger. Are you satisfied that's value for money, and, at this point in the 10-year plan, that things are going as they should, with incomes being squeezed across the sector?\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. I mean, it's difficult, isn't it, to second-guess what would have happened, what might have happened, if the merger hadn't gone ahead, around the financial stability and sustainability of an institution. How do you prove that, if that hadn't happened, something worse or something better\u00a0might have happened? It's difficult to do that and to second-guess those judgments, but, as I've said, what I am interested in\u2014. And I can't change that decision that was made by a previous Minister\u2014it wasn't my decision\u2014but what I can do is to ensure that any lessons learnt, any evaluation of that particular set of circumstances, can be looked at and can help inform future policy, which is why HEFCW is doing the piece of work. When that's published, you and I will be in a better position to understand whether the aspirations of that particular merger were realised, not realised, and if we were in that situation again, could we do it better next time?\nHefin David AM: Okay, so you'll reflect on that later. At this point in time, you don't have any concerns about the long-term sustainability of the University of South Wales.\nKirsty Williams AM: No, not at this point.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. The Welsh Government's draft outline budget for 2019 states that it will continue to provide \u00a320 million to further and higher education in 2019-20. Can you outline how this will be allocated between HE and FE and if conditions will be attached to the funding?\nKirsty Williams AM: Janet, you will have to wait until the end of the month, when the detailed, main expenditure group by main expenditure group lines of the budget are published, otherwise I will be stealing the finance Minister's thunder. There is a process by which the Welsh Government's budget is dealt with, and those details will emerge later on this month.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.\nKirsty Williams AM: But can I just say on conditions\u2014? You will be aware that there are conditions attached to Government spend, both in the FE sector and in the HE sector. Those budgets will be subject to those existing arrangements; so, for instance, in the HE sector, the remit letter to HEFCW.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Can I just pick up on funding, generally? Sorry. Because, we did talk about HEFCW\u00a0and part-time funding earlier, and I'm not sure that we addressed the issue of this \u00a312.5 million cut in a specific budget line from HEFCW, because what they've done, if I understand correctly, is that they've put four priorities into one budget line, which includes part-time teaching, and cut that budget line by \u00a312.5 million. Are you not concerned that that'll have an impact on part-time teaching, given that it's such a success story that you're proud of?\nKirsty Williams AM: HEFCW\u00a0have to take cognisance\u00a0of the remit letter, but then, ultimately, they are free to allocate resources as they see fit. What will drive part-time provision is the students taking it up, and universities responding to that desire and that need within their institutions. So, at this moment, I don't have any concerns.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to look at the parity of esteem between academic and vocational post-16 education. The first question is from Michelle.\nMichelle Brown AM: Thank you, Chair. Welsh Government wants to achieve parity of esteem between academic and vocational education, and I think that's a very laudable aim. Higher apprenticeships are a key part of this, but Estyn's recent inspection found that only four providers from 17 were achieving good outcomes for learners. What action do you propose to take about this, to make sure that those learners have much better outcomes across the board?\nEluned Morgan AM: First of all, just to make it clear that that is very much our intention. I think we have got work to do to make sure that we do reach that parity of esteem, but let's be clear that, in relation to these higher level apprenticeships, we were concerned that, actually, we weren't doing as well, perhaps, as we should be, which is why we commissioned Estyn to look at this specifically, and what it was that we were doing well, and what we needed to improve on. One of the things that we found is that we are doing very well in relation to foundation courses in terms of attainment\u2014we've got 83 per cent attainment levels\u2014but if you look at that at higher level apprenticeships, then we've got 77 per cent, so what is going wrong there? But, also, it's worth underlining the fact that, actually, we're still miles ahead of England, who are only reaching levels of about 61 per cent. So, we're already doing much better than England, but we're ambitious, and we want to make sure that if we are serious about this parity of esteem, how do we get there if we're not offering the kind of quality that we'd like to see in those higher level apprenticeships? So, some of the recommendations in that report, we'll be taking up. We want to increase the number of new employers\u00a0and mentors within the system. I think we're also very keen to make sure that people don't repeat learning that they've already done. That's a danger and it takes up too much time. So, there are lots of these recommendations that now we'll set in motion, and I think the important thing for us then is to understand that, in relation to who's doing well and who's not doing well in the FE sector, the bulk of where that finance goes is actually doing quite well. It's pushing some of the private sector providers where we need to actually make sure that the quality is where we want it to be, and is, very importantly, matching the needs of employers. So, we've constantly got to be looking at the courses: are they responding to the needs of the market and what employers are looking for? And that means revising the offer sometimes in terms of the courses.\nMichelle Brown AM: Where are the difficulties arising\u2014? You refer to difficulties arising with the private providers. What are those difficulties?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, some of it is about, perhaps, not giving the kind of guidance that we'd like them to give in-house. So, they're perhaps not doing the kind of on-the-job work that we'd like them to do. So, I think it's making sure that, when they're in the workplace, they are still being pushed to attain those levels. But I think it's clear that what we need to do is to also listen to what the advisory board that we've set up in relation to apprenticeships is also asking us, and we've got the Confederation of British Industry advising us on that as well.\nMichelle Brown AM: Do you have a service level agreement with the private providers?\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes. I mean, the whole thing is under a tender procedure, obviously, and we will be revising that soon. There'll be a new apprenticeship procurement process that we'll be undergoing and starting to look at that process next year. So, there's an opportunity there for us to drive change in the system.\nMichelle Brown AM: Would you be willing to share the targets under the SLA with the committee?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, I think the\u2014. I can't see that there'd be a problem with that, so I'm sure we could do that, but I think the way to make people move, quite often, is through making sure that you put the finances where they need to be, and then they're likely to shift. And, so, I think, in responding to this Estyn report, we can then build that into the next framework.\nMichelle Brown AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Julie.\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, thank you. Right, I wanted to ask about the investment. If we're going to get parity of esteem, we've got to, probably, get more investment in. Could you say why there isn't more investment in degree, and there doesn't seem to be any investment in Master's-level apprenticeships at universities?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, I think we've got to be careful that what happens is that the state doesn't pick up what, currently, people are prepared to pay for themselves, and, so, we've got to just make sure that that balance is right. So, what's happened in England, for example, is lots of people who were previously sitting Master of business administration courses, for example, are now switching into apprenticeship programmes. So, the system\u2014it means that, previously, they were prepared to pay and now the state is paying or the employer's playing it in a slightly different way. So, I think we've got to just be aware about how\u2014making sure that we don't get employers passing that responsibility that, actually, they have to upskill and to uptrain\u00a0their workers and pass it back on to the state, whereas, actually, they need to step up as well as employers.\nJulie Morgan AM: So, how are you going to judge that? How are you going to tell when, maybe, you should start putting some money in?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, what we are doing is we're putting money into areas where we know there are skills shortages. So, we're focusing where we want those apprenticeships\u2014and particularly at the higher level\u2014to be. So, for example, we're looking at ICT; we're looking at construction. There are\u00a0areas where we definitely need to be focusing our attention. So, that's where we'll be prioritising our funding, and that's what we're doing already.\nKirsty Williams AM: And that's for degree-level apprenticeships, not Master's. Just degree-level apprenticeships.\nJulie Morgan AM: Right, thank you. And then, in terms of getting data, could you clarify the progress on developing outcome and destination data for higher apprenticeships? Your plan seems to suggest that\u00a0data won't be available until 2020-21, at the end of the programme.\nEluned Morgan AM: And that's because we're only just starting on this, and it takes a long time for people to complete an apprenticeship. So, we won't have anybody going from the higher level apprenticeship into a destination until around 2021, so there's no point in measuring that until that point.\nJulie Morgan AM: Right. And then, can you tell us when you'll publish Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol's new operational plan to develop post-16 Welsh-medium provision, which was presented during July, and clarify if the plan requires additional funding?\nEluned Morgan AM: So, there is a report that was published in July, and we are waiting for the operational actions from that report to be published, probably within the next month. In terms of the implementation of that programme, some of that journey has already begun, so they're not waiting for the report to\u2014. We're not waiting for the actions to be very clearly set out; actually, some of that work has been done. For example, already, there's been a review of the governance. We're also looking at the kind of research that needs to be done in that area. I think what's clear, and something that's very much driving me as the Welsh language Minister, is this understanding that you reach 16 and you get this fall off a cliff in terms of the number of people who actually speak and use Welsh. So, that's the thing that we need to address, and that's why moving now into that area of further education is crucial. And the report, written by Delyth Evans, did suggest that we do need to move into this area but, actually, there wasn't necessarily a need for further funding in that area. But it may be something that we will consider, but it's something that we'll try and absorb, perhaps, from within the department.\nKirsty Williams AM: A relatively modest amount of money was being made available this year to be able to kick-start some of this work, but we are mindful of the recommendations from the Evans report. So, future allocations will have to reflect the priorities within the implementation plan, and that's not just money that goes directly to y\u00a0coleg, but also trying to get better alignment between other budget lines that support the Welsh language, and making sure that all budget lines that could help on this agenda are aligned to the recommendations and the implementation report.\nJulie Morgan AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Suzy, on this.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you. Just on\u00a0coleg cenedlaethol's extended remit, have you had\u2014? I haven't read the Evans report, but is there anything in there about the role of increased use of Welsh in adult community learning, for example? That's a further education pot, isn't it?\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes, it is, and we are very much in touch with adult community learning, and they are aware of the responsibilities they have in relation to the Welsh language. The issue, of course, with adult education, is that they have undergone some quite dramatic cuts.\nSuzy Davies AM: Oh, yes, I don't mean the higher education sector that's taken over responsibility for this; I'm talking about community learning, low level, just having Welsh there. And, you know, as you mentioned yourself, post 16, people stop using it, so getting it in wherever you can as part of a strategy.\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes. They're aware of that responsibility and we\u2014\nSuzy Davies AM: They're free to choose partners, then, are they, to help them deliver that?\nEluned Morgan AM: And also to work with the new organisation that we've set up to promote the learning of Welsh, in particular, that is based in Carmarthen. So, that's something also that's being driven, and they're working closely, I think, on this.\nSuzy Davies AM: Oh, great, thanks.\nKirsty Williams AM: There's lots of innovative practice. So, for instance, up in Wrexham, if a student has gone into the college to do A-levels, then they may decide to do those A-levels through the medium of English. But if they were previously in a Welsh-medium school, they are actively encouraged\u2014indeed, persuaded\u2014to do their Welsh baccalaureate through the medium of Welsh. So, they may be doing their A-levels in English, but if they've come from a Welsh-medium school, the college proactively seeks them out and makes sure that there is provision for them to do their Welsh bac qualification through the medium of Welsh, or, for instance, they are working very hard to form tutor groups. So, the tutor group\u2014you might be doing your qualifications in English, but your tutor group will be a Welsh-medium tutor group, so that you are placed\u00a0with other students who have come from Welsh-medium schools, and your tutor does all that tutor work through the medium of Welsh. So, there are other ways in which we can continue to help support children's linguistic ability, even if they have made a decision not to formally study their A-levels, for instance, or a course, through the medium of Welsh, and we're constantly looking at new ways. I think one particular aspect of the market\u2014if we call it that word\u2014that we're interested in are those students who've been to Welsh-medium schools, but at 16, perhaps, as I say, decide to go to a college. So, for instance, here in Cardiff, looking at childcare, and the opportunity\u2014you know, there's a sector where we know we need a Welsh-medium workforce.\nSuzy Davies AM: Yes, definitely.\nKirsty Williams AM: So, again, it's trying to target those children, and track them from a previous Welsh-medium education into a college, capturing their language skills, and finding ways in which they can use them. Merthyr college\u2014there's a Welsh-medium champion in Merthyr college actively looking for children who have come from a Welsh-medium background, and they are allocated roles as Welsh-medium champions within the college, to promote. So, there are lots of innovative ways, especially in the FE sector, that they're looking to keep children's linguistic skills relevant, and they're using them, even if they make that decision to switch the language of their tuition.\nSuzy Davies AM: Well, that's encouraging to hear. My question was about community learning, where it's essentially older people who perhaps are coming back to education in a way that wasn't as formal as it was before, if I can put it like that\u2014so we don't lose sight of them as well. I've still got an abiding worry that there's a cohort in the middle here of people who we might lose, and maybe pass on bad attitudes towards the Welsh language to their children, despite the fact that those children now have huge opportunities to absorb Welsh language skills and make the most of them.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. The next questions are from Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you, Chair. I'd like to ask about the regional skills partnership\u2014partnerships, I should say\u2014because they are having a direct influence now on courses and provision in FE, and with degree apprenticeships in universities as well. You, I believe, received the Graystone review back in March, so could you tell us a bit about what was in it, and what the recommendations are?\nEluned Morgan AM: So, some of the recommendations\u2014. So, we wanted to review it because it's still relatively new. They've only been up and running about two or three years. He brought out some positives\u2014things that we, I think, are doing well. I think they found that the voluntary partnership approach was quite effective. He did suggest that, actually, what they need to be producing is much shorter, sharper, focused reports. There was a suggestion of a lack of transparency, in terms of reporting from those regional skills partnerships, and that's obviously something now that we've undertaken to review. And there, I think, is an understanding that what we need to do now is to put in place those changes. But, on the whole, what we've done is to reinforce our commitment to the regional skills partnerships, and in particular now, through allocating \u00a310 million to further education colleges to respond directly to the wishes and the desires of the regional skills partnerships, you can see actually the status of the regional skills partnerships has just grown significantly. Because now there is an outcome as a result of their recommendations. So, you've seen quite a dramatic shift, I think, in the respect for regional skills partnerships over the past year.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: So, are there any recommendations in terms of governance as well\u2014\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: \u2014because, clearly, there may have been concerns about the way that people ended up being members of the partnerships? You touched on transparency\u2014clearly, that's an issue as well. So, just particularly on governance\u2014.\nEluned Morgan AM: So, on governance, I think there was an understanding that that needs to be looked at again, and that we need to get the right people around the table. And what is interesting is, I think, because it was a voluntary approach, because now people can see an outcome, we're getting different people now really showing an interest in being a part of the regional skills partnerships. So, governance is something again we're going to be addressing and following up the recommendations on in that Graystone review. Is there anything to add to that?\nHuw Morris: Well, I was just going to say, I don't see why we couldn't share the review with you.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: That was going to be my next question.\nHuw Morris: That might be helpful. And we are actioning the recommendations from that review.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The normal course of action would be, of course, to have published it and then to publish a Government response. Any reason why that wasn't done? I find it quite strange that you're saying that you're actually actioning the report and you still haven't published it. As a committee, we've not been party to any of that, really.\nEluned Morgan AM: I don't see why that can't be done. There's nothing to hide here, so why wouldn't we? We're the people who commissioned the report\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: I'm the one asking the questions. [Laughter.] No, but you're right. I just find it strange. I just find it odd that that hasn't been published.\nEluned Morgan AM: Okay. Well, we'll certainly get a copy of that to you.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, okay.\nHuw Morris: May I just\u00a0say: we ask a number of people periodically to comment on what we do, and agencies we work with do the same. The status of those reports varies. I don't suppose we'd anticipated there would be the interest in this issue that there is and so, as the Minister said, there's no problem that I can see with that.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: And do you have a timeline in terms of by when you want to introduce some of the reforms that you're looking at now, because of this report?\nEluned Morgan AM: Some of them have already been introduced, so we're not waiting. The transparency issue that I think there was a bit of concern about\u2014that's already been introduced. So, it's just about making sure that people understand what is going on in these regional skills partnerships. I think that's really important\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Well, quite, given the influence that they have\u00a0now. Yes, sure. Just another short one on the regional skills partnerships, really: how effective are they in supporting the planning and delivery of Welsh-medium provision in post-16?\nEluned Morgan AM: I think there's more we can do in relation to that. But I think there are aspects where we're already changing in respect of specific\u00a0sectors. So, if you think about the care sector, for example, what we do need is more people\u00a0who have those skills to speak through the medium of Welsh in the\u00a0care sector. And, coming back to the point that was made earlier, what we're doing now is looking at the curriculum: to what extent can we include\u2014? You don't have to do your whole course through the medium of Welsh, but there are aspects that would be very useful. So, those kind of things are being taken on board now in terms of the courses. One of the things that the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol are looking at is building the resources that will be needed in order to mainstream those into, in particular, those\u00a0front-line service areas where we have a skills shortage.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Cabinet Secretary, you know that\u00a0this committee has taken a very keen interest in the emotional and mental health of our young people. In the summer, the English universities Minister made an announcement about the development of a new mental health charter. That followed some concerns about young people\u00a0dying by suicide across the UK. Is Welsh Government expecting Welsh universities to sign up to that charter or are you planning to work on your own?\nKirsty Williams AM: Thank you for raising this. I think it's really important that whilst for many, many, many young people moving away from home and starting their degree course is an incredibly exciting time and something they look forward to hugely, it can bring significant stresses with it, especially for first-year students, who, as I said, are moving away, perhaps are suddenly responsible for finances in a way they've never been responsible for, for all the day-to-day living that perhaps they've relied on other people to assist them with. So, it can be quite a stressful time. So, it is right that we look at how we can support health and well-being for students, especially mental health and mental resilience. So, I very much welcome the work on the mental health\u00a0charter, and HEFCW\u00a0are engaged and keeping a very close eye on what's going on to see the opportunities for Welsh universities to participate in that. But this was on a recent agenda item that I had with HEFCW, and indeed with the\u00a0vice-chancellors, when I met them last week, or the week before last. So, they are developing their own strategic approach to well-being and health for students, which will be underpinned by a co-created action plan with the universities themselves on supporting students\u00a0with mental health problems in particular. So, the strategic approach and the\u00a0action plan are being developed by HEFCW\u00a0at the moment and HEFCW\u00a0are also meeting with colleagues from England and Scotland to see the opportunities for a universal approach across the UK to supporting students. The universities, when I met with them recently, all shared a commitment to do better in this particular area. One, because it's the right thing to do, but, actually,\u00a0stopping people from dropping out and not completing their courses obviously is of a financial benefit\u00a0to the institution. So, it's actually the right thing to do for their students, they want to do it for that reason, but, actually, there is a strong financial underpinning to ensure that students complete their studies. So, it's looking at, again, each university looking at individual approaches of how better they can do that. But it's not just responding to students who become unwell, it's\u00a0actually, 'What can we do to in the campus to maintain\u00a0good mental health?' So, rather than just trying to fix a problem once it's occurred, it's 'What can we do?' And you'll be aware of individual institutions\u00a0taking different approaches. It's not something that we dictate, but individual institutions\u2014when they do exams, how work is assessed and marked and graded\u2014are taking different steps to promote well-being, as well as then responding to situations where students become unwell. We do know that financial pressures can be a source of huge stress for students, so we are constantly working with the Student Loans Company to make sure that the services that they offer to people are as good as they can be, and that there are no unnecessary delays that, perhaps, put a student under pressure or give students worries about their financial situation. And I would argue our Diamond reforms, which allow students\u00a0access to a living wage\u2014for some students, completely by a grant, for some students, a combination of grant and loan, with no expectation at\u00a0all that your parents\u00a0will contribute, which is not the case in\u00a0other places where there is an expectation of parental contribution\u2014that actually, hopefully, addresses some of those financial worries that some students may have. But I am aware that if people are waiting for their grant or people are waiting\u00a0for their payments, that can be a source of stress. So, ensuring that we have good performance by the Student Loans Company is crucial.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And I'm sure the committee's very interested to hear the update on that. Are you able to give us any indication of timescale\u00a0by which you'd expect HEFCW\u00a0and the individual universities to actually have this work in place?\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm not sure, but I will write to the committee and let you know. In fact, we can probably provide, from Universities Wales and from the work that's going on centrally, a list of\u00a0proposals that are being undertaken.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much. The next question is from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. I wanted to ask you about the pay dispute, and I know that you're not the employer, because\u00a0I know that's going to be the first answer\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM: You're right, that is the first answer. [Laughter.] Well anticipated.\nDawn Bowden AM: But we are in a stalemate here and you clearly have an interest in making sure that this dispute is resolved quickly\u00a0in the interest of the students and the reputation of the colleges et cetera, et\u00a0cetera. I can see how this dispute has arisen. When we've seen the teachers' pay settlement, we've seen FE settlements in England and Scotland higher than what's\u00a0on the table here. And I am concerned, and I do think this is where the Welsh Government does have a role, because\u00a0I am concerned that the employers seem to be using the funding issue as the reason not to have a reasonable settlement with staff. So, they've walked away from the table, they've said, 'One per cent, take it or leave it. Unless Welsh Government gives us any more money, that's the end of that.' And I'm really concerned about that, because\u00a0this is potentially going to have a major impact on whether we can recruit\u00a0and retain staff in FE colleges. And I look at the college in my constituency, Merthyr\u00a0college\u2014it's a tertiary college, they're providing A-level education across Merthyr\u00a0and they're astounding results they've been getting as well. I'm coming round to the question in a moment. It's really: what more do you think you can do as a Government to try to get these parties back round the table and not allow the dispute to become a political football?\nEluned Morgan AM: Thanks very much for that. I think, first of all, you're absolutely right\u2014this is about ColegauCymru's negotiation, but we are keeping a close eye on the situation. I think it's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about, or part of the reason, is because\u00a0you've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers' pay and we've had the consequential. So, sixth-form teachers are happy. The people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution, you can understand why they may say, 'Something needs to change here.' The problem here is that it's about that, actually, that falls to the Welsh Government. We don't have that. Or at least it falls to FE colleges to fund that,\u00a0and it's up to them to come up with that proposal. We are keeping a close eye on things. I think it's fair to say that we'll wait until they get further along down the line, but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you for that, Minister. When you say you're keeping a close eye on it, have you actually had conversations with ColegauCymru? Because I note what you just said there:\u00a0'We'll keep an eye on it and wait and see what's happening.' Well, all the unions are currently consulting. One has already balloted for industrial action. We could have the other unions also balloting for industrial action. I mean, this isn't something we want in the FE sector, clearly, so is there anything more proactive that Government could actually be doing to try to bring a resolution to this dispute?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we are listening and speaking to ColegauCymru, and also we're aware of what the unions are saying as well. So, I think that's probably as far as we can go at this point. When they come to a conclusion, and when they come to us and say, 'Look, this is the consequence and this will finish'\u2014at this point, we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you.\u00a0Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, thank you. Yes, we wouldn't expect you to make an announcement on this, because it's happening outside of Government, but there is a principle here, isn't there, in terms of pay equality between schoolteachers and FE? So, would you not wish to see a situation where we do have greater equality in that respect?\nEluned Morgan AM: In relation to teaching, I think it's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching, yes.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay, thank you. You emphasise\u00a0'in relation to teaching'\u2014my next question is that, of course, within FE establishments you have teaching staff and non-teaching staff, and if there was to be some sort of increase, then would you not expect all staff to have that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, let's see\u2014that's up to ColegauCymru\u00a0to negotiate and to discuss, so let's see what the outcomes are.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Because some of the non-teaching staff are the lowest paid, as well, aren't they? So, you know\u2014.\nEluned Morgan AM: Let's wait for the outcome of the negotiations. I think we are very aware of the situation. ColegauCymru are in that negotiation. We're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members, and we'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Could I just briefly as well ask about pensions, because that's coming down the line, potentially, isn't it, and the impact that's going to have on FE? One college was saying it will cost them \u00a31 million if it happens next year. Are you thinking about any steps that you could take to support them, potentially, because obviously this is coming down the line, really, isn't it?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, I think, already, we've got the situation in relation to teachers, and again what we've seen is the consequential and the UK Government honouring that. Again, what we don't have, necessarily, is that money coming down from the UK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or \u00a310.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?\nEluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from\u00a0Professor Colin Riordan\u00a0on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter\u2014it was actually to me\u2014that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give\u00a0me your opinions on that, please?\nKirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity\u2014. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put\u2014. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.\nHefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed\u00a0centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites\u00a0that offer to write essays for cash.\nKirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.]\u00a0My understanding is\u2014\nHefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee\u2014. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM: You did.\nHefin David AM: The websites\u00a0say to you, 'Unless\u00a0you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system\u2014some of that money will go to these websites.\nKirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself\u2014\nHefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did\u2014a student deliberately\u00a0went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.\nHefin David AM: And just\u2014final question\u2014with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?\nKirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?\nHuw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.\nHefin David AM: Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private.\u00a0Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.", "answers": ["Although there were no exact figures,they had seen over recent years that they were only recruiting to about 65 percent of targets. It was partially due to the financial incentives, but that was not all of the problems. Because this issue was not only in Wales, but a common issue in all over the world. For example, in England, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, people still were not getting onto those courses. To solve this problem, they had taken several steps including making sure their ITE provision was world class, embarking on the first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise, etc. In this process, Llyr Gruffydd had a doubt that the level of ambition did not reflect the level of action that was needed actually. Kirsty Williams responded that different statistics told different stories. They obviously understood there were many steps they had to take, but they were trying instead of just sitting back and waiting."], "pred": " 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17.42. 17", "length": 13883, "dataset": "qmsum", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3814c81130c13d1df955f1c6e235e30559ced35bda5f139e"}
{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProfessor E: So . OK . Doesn't look like it crashed . That 's great .\nGrad G: So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working . And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash . So , I won't do that anymore .\nPostdoc B: And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the {disfmarker} without having people have to give their names each time ?\nPhD A: Sounds like an initialization thing .\nPostdoc B: I mean it 's like you have the {disfmarker} So you know that {disfmarker}\nGrad G: No .\nPostdoc B: I mean , are you going to write down {pause} that I sat here ?\nGrad G: I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .\nPostdoc B: OK .\nPhD C: Oh , OK .\nGrad G: So {disfmarker} So they should be right with what 's on the digit forms . OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits . u And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .\nProfessor E: And start by giving the transcript number .\nPhD A: Tran\nPhD D: Transcript {disfmarker} Uh . OK , OK .\nPhD A: Oh sorry , go ahead .\nProfessor E: So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .\nGrad H: OK .\nProfessor E: It 's just uh {disfmarker}\nGrad H: Umh .\nProfessor E: Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have {comment} that information .\nGrad G: And I 'm surprised I sort of {disfmarker} I 'm surprised I forgot that ,\nProfessor E: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's some\nGrad G: but uh I think that would be a good thing to add . After I just printed out a zillion of them .\nProfessor E: Yeah , well , that 's {disfmarker} Um , so I {disfmarker} I do have a {disfmarker} a an agenda suggestion . Uh , we {disfmarker} I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we {disfmarker} we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So {vocalsound} uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and {disfmarker} and uh sort of we have {disfmarker} anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the {disfmarker} the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a {disfmarker} a couple weeks before um uh about the uh {disfmarker} the stuff you were doing with {disfmarker} with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: like some other noise .\nPhD D: Uh - huh . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .\nPhD D: To\nProfessor E: So at any rate you were {disfmarker} you 've {disfmarker} you 've done some work on that\nPhD D: right .\nProfessor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you {disfmarker} you haven't been in {disfmarker} in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that {disfmarker} that uh {disfmarker} that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some um uh work about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I {disfmarker} I don't want to try to say cuz I {disfmarker} I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some {disfmarker} some potential collaboration there about {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} working with these data .\nPhD C: Oh . Sure .\nProfessor E: So . So , uh .\nGrad G: You wanna just go around ?\nProfessor E: Uh . {pause} Well , I don't know if we {disfmarker} if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple {disfmarker} a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't {disfmarker} Actually I think that {disfmarker} that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you {disfmarker} you start with that .\nPostdoc B: OK . Shall I {disfmarker} shall I just start ? OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .\nPostdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of {disfmarker} you know , relating to his {disfmarker} to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this {disfmarker} this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how {pause} um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the causal aspects of the uh floor and {disfmarker} and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it {disfmarker} {comment} These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , {comment} and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And {disfmarker} and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now {pause} we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know . So it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {pause} i What you {disfmarker} what you int what you draw {disfmarker} you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,\nGrad G: Hmm , metaphorically .\nPostdoc B: that um , i that {pause} i we have enough space , and he continues , like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \" . So you have to sort of get the idea that um , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far . But there are a lot of different things like that .\nGrad G: So , do you think his interest is in using this as {pause} a data source , or {pause} training material , or what ?\nProfessor E: Well , I {disfmarker} I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're {disfmarker} already have and see , is there anything to this at all ?\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it . Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say \" well , this is just the wrong {pause} task for {disfmarker} for him to pursue his {disfmarker} \"\nGrad G: Wrong , yeah .\nProfessor E: And {disfmarker} and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that {disfmarker} that you looked at that {disfmarker} that it 's plausible at least .\nPostdoc B: It 's possible . Uh , he was {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} We met and he was gonna go and uh you know , y look through them more systematically\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: and then uh meet again .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: So it 's , you know , not a matter of a {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: But , yeah , I think {disfmarker} I think it was optimistic .\nProfessor E: So anyway , that 's {disfmarker} that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might {disfmarker} might {disfmarker} might come out from some of this .\nPhD C: But he can use text , basically . I mean , he 's talking about just using text\nPostdoc B: That 's his major {disfmarker} I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours\nPhD C: pretty much , or {disfmarker} ?\nPostdoc B: and {pause} that wasn't as directly relevant to what he 's doing . He 's interested in these {disfmarker} these knowledge structures ,\nPhD C: OK .\nPhD D: Yeah , interesting .\nPostdoc B: inferences that you draw {pause} i from {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: I mean , he certainly could use text , but we were in fact looking to see if there {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in this stuff . So .\nGrad G: And I imagine that transcripts of speech {disfmarker} I mean text that is speech {disfmarker} probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing . I {disfmarker} I don't know whether it would or not , but it seems like it would .\nProfessor E: I don't know , probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing was . But .\nPostdoc B: Yeah , I don't think I would make that leap , because i in narratives , you know {disfmarker} I mean , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious ,\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc B: so .\nGrad G: Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're {disfmarker} when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel and {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Oh . That aspect .\nGrad G: Yeah . And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face . I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying \" we 're ahead of the game \" {comment} in that {disfmarker} in that context ,\nPostdoc B: Well {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad G: I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else .\nPostdoc B: I {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them .\nGrad G: Uh - huh .\nPostdoc B: This {disfmarker} this one really does um m make you leap from {disfmarker} So he said , you know , \" we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling \" .\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc B: And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I guess it would be the same .\nPostdoc B: Uh - huh . But there are others that have backchannelling , it 's just he was less interested in those .\nPhD F: Can I {disfmarker} Sorry to interrupt . Um , I f f f I 've {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} d A minute {disfmarker} uh , several minutes ago , I , like , briefly was {disfmarker} was not listening and {disfmarker} So who is \" he \" in this context ?\nPhD C: Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun {disfmarker}\nPhD F: OK . So I was just realizing we 've {disfmarker} You guys have been talking about \" he \" um for at least uh , I don't know , three {disfmarker} three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again .\nPhD C: I believe it . Yeah . Actually to make it worse , {comment} uh , Morgan uses \" you \" and \" you \"\nPhD F: So this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} gonna be a big , big problem if you want to later do uh , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort .\nGrad G: It 's in my notes .\nPhD C: with gaze and no identification , or {disfmarker} I just wrote this down . Yeah , actually . Cuz Morgan will say well , \" you had some ideas \"\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD F: You just wrote this ?\nPhD C: and he never said Li - He looked {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Well , I think he 's doing that intentionally ,\nPhD C: Right , so it 's great .\nGrad G: aren't you ?\nPhD C: So this is really great\nPhD F: Right .\nPhD C: because the thing is , because he 's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics . Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice .\nProfessor E: Uh - huh . Could be .\nPostdoc B: Can we\nProfessor E: Yeah . That would be tou\nGrad G: Oh , that would be interesting .\nPhD C: Yeah , so that , I mean , to even know um when {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice .\nGrad G: Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell .\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad G: Uh .\nPostdoc B: Oh , but you 'd have the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Put Morgan always like this\nPostdoc B: You 'd have fainter {disfmarker}\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here ?\nProfessor E: Well , these {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ? Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking , now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking , I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference .\nPhD C: But you don't have this {disfmarker} this problem .\nPostdoc B: I see .\nPhD C: Morgan is the one who does this most .\nGrad G: So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you .\nProfessor E: I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about {disfmarker} and concerns about \" oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? \" and so on .\nGrad G: Lawyers .\nProfessor E: And so I {disfmarker} so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though uh {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: I am too .\nPhD C: Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at .\nPostdoc B: I am too .\nGrad G: And we did mention who \" he \" was .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD F: Right , but I missed it .\nGrad G: Early in the conversation .\nPhD F: But {disfmarker} it was uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: Do {disfmarker} Sh - Can I say\nProfessor E: Yeah . No no , there 's {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad G: or {disfmarker} or is that just too sensitive ?\nProfessor E: No no , it isn't sensitive at all .\nPostdoc B: Well {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: I was just {disfmarker} I was just {disfmarker} I was overreacting just because we 've been talking about it .\nPostdoc B: And in fact , it is {disfmarker} it is {disfmarker} it is sensitive .\nPhD C: No , but that {disfmarker} it 's interesting .\nProfessor E: It 's OK to {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: I {disfmarker} I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention . I mean , it fits into the m area of the mundane , but they did say {disfmarker} You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says \" no individuals will be identified uh , \" in any publication using the data . \" OK , well , individuals being identified , let 's say you have a {disfmarker} a snippet that says , \" Joe s uh thinks such - and - such about {disfmarker} about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . \" Now I mean , we 're {disfmarker} we 're gonna be careful not to have the \" wrongheaded \" part in there , but {disfmarker} but you know , let 's say we say , you know , \" Joe used to think so - and - so about this area , in his publication he says that but I think he 's changed his mind . \" or whatever . Then the issue of {disfmarker} of being able to trace Joe , because we know he 's well - known in this field , and all this and {disfmarker} and tie it to the speaker , whose name was just mentioned a moment ago , can be sensitive .\nProfessor E: b But I {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: So I think it 's really {disfmarker} really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there 's a slanderous aspect to it , then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove ?\nProfessor E: Yeah , well , there 's that . But I {disfmarker} I mean I think also to some extent it 's just educating the Human Subjects people , in a way , because there 's {disfmarker} If uh {disfmarker} You know , there 's court transcripts , there 's {disfmarker} there 's transcripts of radio shows {disfmarker} I mean people say people 's names all the time . So I think it {disfmarker} it can't be bad to say people 's names . It 's just that {disfmarker} i I mean you 're right that there 's more poten If we never say anybody 's name , then there 's no chance of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of slandering anybody ,\nPhD C: But , then it won't {disfmarker} I mean , if we {disfmarker} if we {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: but {disfmarker}\nGrad G: It 's not a meeting .\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean we should do whatever 's natural in a meeting if {disfmarker} if we weren't being recorded .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Right , so I {disfmarker} So my behavior is probably not natural .\nPhD C: \" If Person X {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor E: So .\nPostdoc B: Well , my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it , you know .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD F: Well , if you ha since you have to um go over the transcripts later anyway , you could make it one of the jobs of the {pause} people who do that to mark\nGrad G: Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization .\nPhD F: Right .\nGrad G: If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name . And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that .\nProfessor E: Yeah , we really can't . But a actually , I 'm sorry . I really would like to push {disfmarker} finish this off .\nPostdoc B: I understand . No I just {disfmarker} I just was suggesting that it 's not a bad policy p potentially .\nProfessor E: So it 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: So , we need to talk about this later .\nProfessor E: Yeah , I di I didn't intend it an a policy though .\nPostdoc B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: It was {disfmarker} it was just it was just unconscious {disfmarker} well , semi - conscious behavior . I sorta knew I was doing it but it was {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Well , I still don't know who \" he \" is .\nProfessor E: I {disfmarker} I do I don't remember who \" he \" is .\nPhD C: No , you have to say , you still don't know who \" he \" is , with that prosody .\nProfessor E: Ah . Uh , we were talking about Dan at one point {comment} and we were talking about Lokendra at another point .\nPostdoc B: Yeah , depends on which one you mean .\nProfessor E: And I don't {disfmarker} I don't remember which {disfmarker} which part .\nPhD F: Oh .\nPhD C: It 's ambiguous , so it 's OK .\nProfessor E: Uh , I think {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Well , the inference structures was Lokendra .\nPhD F: But no . The inference stuff was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} was Lokendra .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD F: OK . That makes sense , yeah .\nPhD C: And the downsampling must have been Dan .\nProfessor E: Um {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Good {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's an inference .\nProfessor E: Yeah , you could do all these inferences , yeah .\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Um , I {disfmarker} I would like to move it into {disfmarker} into uh what Jose uh has been doing\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nProfessor E: because he 's actually been doing something .\nPhD D: Uh - huh . OK .\nProfessor E: So . {vocalsound} Right .\nPhD F: As opposed to the rest of us .\nPhD D: Well - {comment} {vocalsound} OK . I {disfmarker} I remind that me {disfmarker} my first objective eh , in the project is to {disfmarker} to study difference parameters to {disfmarker} to find a {disfmarker} a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . But eh , {vocalsound} tsk , {comment} {vocalsound} ehhh {comment} In that way {comment} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I begin to {disfmarker} to study and to analyze the ehn {disfmarker} the recorded speech eh the different session to {disfmarker} to find and to locate and to mark eh the {disfmarker} the different overlapping zone . And eh so eh I was eh {disfmarker} I am transcribing the {disfmarker} the first session and I {disfmarker} I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , eh {disfmarker} {comment} I don't know what is the different names eh you use to {disfmarker} to name the {disfmarker} the {pause} n speech\nPhD A: Nonspeech sounds ?\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Oh , I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail . So .\nPhD D: Yeah . Eh , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do I don't need to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to mmm {vocalsound} {disfmarker} to m to label the {disfmarker} the different acoustic , but I prefer because eh I would like to {disfmarker} to study if eh , I {disfmarker} I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to test these parameters eh with the {disfmarker} another eh , eh acoustic events , to nnn {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to eh {disfmarker} to find what is the ehm {disfmarker} the false {disfmarker} eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the {disfmarker} the ehm {disfmarker} this eh parameter {disfmarker} eh I mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: You know {disfmarker} I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there 's two there .\nGrad G: So it was {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: I mean , if it 's a tapping sound , you wouldn't necessarily {disfmarker} or , you know , something like that , it 'd be {disfmarker} it might be hard to know that it was two separate events .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad G: Well {disfmarker} You weren't talking about just overlaps\nPhD D: Ye\nGrad G: were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general ,\nGrad G: Someone starts , someone stops {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD D: but eh my {disfmarker} my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone .\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Eh ? {comment} n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events .\nProfessor E: How many overlaps were there uh in it ? No no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ?\nPhD D: How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session\nGrad G: Oh , God !\nPhD D: in five {disfmarker} eh in forty - five minutes .\nPhD A: Three hundred overlapping speech {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone .\nGrad G: Ugh .\nPhD C: Overlapping speech .\nPhD D: With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech {disfmarker} speech what eh different duration .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Sure .\nPostdoc B: Does this {disfmarker} ? So if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ?\nPhD D: Yeah , three people , two people . Eh , um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , be\nProfessor E: No no , but I think what she 's asking is {pause} if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ?\nPhD D: Oh . Oh . Yeah . I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone . This {disfmarker} th I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I con I consider {disfmarker} I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh {disfmarker} are talking together .\nGrad G: Well {disfmarker} So let 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: For\nGrad G: So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time , and then Liz starts talking also over all of us . How many events would that be ?\nPhD D: So - I don't understand .\nGrad G: So , two people are talking , {comment} and then a third person starts talking .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nGrad G: Is there an event right here ?\nPhD D: Eh no . No no . For me is the overlapping zone , because {disfmarker} because you {disfmarker} you have s you have more one {disfmarker} eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in a moment .\nProfessor E: I see .\nGrad G: So i if two or more people are talking .\nProfessor E: OK . Yeah . So I think {disfmarker} Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it .\nPhD D: Yeah . If\nProfessor E: So then , in the region between {disfmarker} since there {disfmarker} there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: Is it {disfmarker} Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: or are you calling the entire length of it the event ?\nPhD D: I consider the {disfmarker} the , nnn {disfmarker} the nnn , nnn {disfmarker} eh , the entirety eh , eh , all {disfmarker} all the time there were {disfmarker} the voice has overlapped .\nProfessor E: OK .\nPhD D: This is the idea . But eh I {disfmarker} I don't distinguish between the {disfmarker} the numbers of eh speaker . Uh , I 'm not considering {vocalsound} eh the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} ehm {vocalsound} eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ? Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking , and eh , eh a third person eh join to {disfmarker} to that . For me , it 's eh {disfmarker} it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event . Wi - but {disfmarker} uh , without any mark between the zone {disfmarker} of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , and the zone with the three speakers .\nPostdoc B: That would j just be one .\nPhD D: It {disfmarker} One . One .\nPostdoc B: OK .\nPhD D: Eh , with eh , a beginning mark and the ending mark . Because eh {vocalsound} for me , is the {disfmarker} is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral .\nProfessor E: Got it .\nPhD D: I don't mind {disfmarker} By the moment , by the moment .\nGrad G: Well , but {disfmarker} But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} Yeah , but eh {disfmarker} but eh I have to study . {comment} What will happen in a general way ,\nProfessor E: Could .\nGrad G: So . You had to start somewhere .\nProfessor E: Yeah . We just w\nPhD C: So there 's a lot of overlap .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't know what eh will {disfmarker} will happen with the {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: So .\nGrad G: That 's a lot of overlap ,\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nProfessor E: So again , that 's {disfmarker} that 's three {disfmarker} three hundred in forty - five minutes that are {disfmarker} that are speakers , just speakers .\nGrad G: yeah , for forty - five minutes .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Uh - huh . OK . Yeah .\nPostdoc B: But a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a th\nProfessor E: So that 's about eight per minute .\nPostdoc B: But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah , {pause} but {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD C: But that can include taps .\nPhD D: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Uh . Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot .\nPhD D: General .\nPhD C: Actually {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I con I consider {disfmarker} I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too .\nPostdoc B: Silent .\nGrad G: Silence starting or silence ending {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah , silent , ground to {disfmarker} bec to detect {disfmarker} eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech .\nPhD C: Oh , OK .\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD D: In ge in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in a general point of view .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor E: OK , so how many of those thousand were silence ?\nPhD C: Alright .\nPhD D: in the per\nPhD F: Not speech {disfmarker} not speech or too much speech .\nPhD D: Too much speech .\nProfessor E: Right . So how many of those thousand were silence , silent sections ?\nPhD D: Yeah . Uh silent , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't the {disfmarker} eh I {disfmarker} I would like to {disfmarker} to do a stylistic study\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD D: and give you eh with the report eh from eh the {disfmarker} the study from the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the session {disfmarker} one session .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: And I {disfmarker} I found that eh another thing . When eh {vocalsound} eh I w I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file , um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm {disfmarker} the mixed file , to {disfmarker} to transcribe , the {disfmarker} the events and the words , I {disfmarker} I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike {disfmarker} eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh {disfmarker} collected by headphone .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD D: And {disfmarker} It 's right .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD D: But the problem is {vocalsound} the following . The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different , but eh the {disfmarker} the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by {disfmarker} by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file . And so if {disfmarker} when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn {disfmarker} the mixed file , it 's possible {disfmarker} eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system , it 's possible you eh {disfmarker} in the eh i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh {disfmarker} to nnn {disfmarker} to do the experiments {pause} with the {disfmarker} the system ,\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD D: its possible to evaluate eh , eh {disfmarker} or to consider eh acoustic events that {disfmarker} which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the {disfmarker} by the mike .\nGrad G: Right . The {disfmarker} the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea . It 's a good idea I think .\nGrad G: So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: I mean , if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh {disfmarker} to eh {disfmarker} to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal .\nGrad G: So .\nPhD D: I mean the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the signal collected by the {disfmarker} eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to {disfmarker} to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm . The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the far - field , yeah .\nPhD D: you have to {disfmarker} to analyze {disfmarker} you have to {disfmarker} to process . Because I {disfmarker} I found a difference .\nProfessor E: Yeah , well , just {disfmarker} I mean , just in that {disfmarker} that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that {disfmarker} that we {disfmarker} we passed on to others a few months ago , there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and {disfmarker} and uh , in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could . So yeah , it 's clear that if you wanna study {disfmarker} if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use a distant mike .\nPhD F: That 's good .\nProfessor E: On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ?\nProfessor E: so it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad G: If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear Jane interrupting me , but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling . And so if you 're interested in {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I {disfmarker} I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem ,\nProfessor E: Some {comment} of it 's masking {disfmarker} masked .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ?\nProfessor E: Right .\nPhD C: right ?\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Although the other issue is that the {pause} mixed close - talking mikes {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that .\nPhD C: But it 's known .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: I mean , the normalization you do is over the whole conversation\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: isn't it , over the whole meeting .\nGrad G: Right . Yep .\nPhD C: So if you wanted to study people overlapping people , that 's not a problem .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think eh I saw the nnn {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} eh but eh I eh {disfmarker} I have eh any results . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I saw the {disfmarker} the speech file collected by eh the fet mike , and eh eh signal eh to eh {disfmarker} to noise eh relation is eh low . It 's low .\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: It 's very low . You would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD D: And I {disfmarker} I found that nnn {disfmarker} that eh , {vocalsound} ehm , pr probably ,\nGrad G: Did {disfmarker} Did you\nPhD D: I 'm not sure eh by the moment , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , {vocalsound} eh for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in several eh parts of the files where you {disfmarker} you can find eh , eh {vocalsound} eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the {disfmarker} in the meeting ,\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: it 's probably in {disfmarker} in that eh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in those files you {disfmarker} you can not find {disfmarker} you can not process because eh it 's confused with {disfmarker} with noise .\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: And there are {vocalsound} a lot of I think . But I have to study with more detail . But eh my idea is to {disfmarker} to process only {pause} nnn , this eh {disfmarker} nnn , this kind of s of eh speech . Because I think it 's more realistic . I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , but eh {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: No {disfmarker} i\nGrad G: Well , it 's more realistic but it 'll {disfmarker} it 'll be a lot harder .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your {disfmarker} if i if {disfmarker} if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people {disfmarker} people 's speech , you will {disfmarker} you will get that somewhat better .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Um , Are you making any use {disfmarker} uh you were {disfmarker} you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed .\nPhD D: With {disfmarker} By Jane .\nProfessor E: Does it uh {disfmarker} Yes .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Now um did you make any use of that ? See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Do you {disfmarker}\nPhD D: The {disfmarker} the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to use to {disfmarker} to nnn , {vocalsound} eh to put {disfmarker} i i it 's a reference for me . But eh the transcription {disfmarker} eh for example , I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not interested in the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in {disfmarker} eh follow in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the {disfmarker} in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker , in the {disfmarker} in the meeting , um eh she {disfmarker} she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh {disfmarker} there is an overlapping zone . But eh there isn't any {disfmarker} any mark , time {disfmarker} temporal mark , to {disfmarker} to c eh {disfmarker} to mmm {vocalsound} {disfmarker} e - heh , to label {comment} the beginning and the end of the {disfmarker} of the\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm . OK . Right , so she is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: ta I 'm {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think eh we need this information to\nProfessor E: Right . So the twelve {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} it took you twelve hours {disfmarker} of course this included maybe some {disfmarker} some time where you were learning about what {disfmarker} what you wanted to do , but {disfmarker} but uh , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your\nGrad G: Twelve minutes .\nPhD D: Twelve minutes .\nProfessor E: s Twelve minutes !\nPhD D: Twelve minutes . Twelve .\nProfessor E: I thought you did forty - five minutes of {disfmarker}\nPhD D: No , forty - five minutes is the {disfmarker} is the session , all the session .\nPostdoc B: Oh .\nProfessor E: Oh , you haven't done the whole session .\nPhD D: Yeah , all is the {vocalsound} the session .\nProfessor E: This is just twelve minutes .\nPhD D: Tw - twelve hours of work to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part {disfmarker} of f\nProfessor E: Oh . So {comment} let me back up again . So the {disfmarker} when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: that 's in twelve minutes ?\nPhD D: No no no . I {disfmarker} I consider all the {disfmarker} all the session because eh I {disfmarker} I count the nnn {disfmarker} the nnn {disfmarker} the overlappings marked by {disfmarker} by Jane ,\nProfessor E: Oh , OK .\nPostdoc B: Oh , I see .\nPhD D: in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the {pause} fin in {disfmarker} in the {pause} forty - five minutes .\nProfessor E: OK . So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes , but you have {disfmarker} you have time uh , uh marked {disfmarker} twelve minute {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Got it .\nPhD F: So , can I ask {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can I ask whether you found {disfmarker} uh , you know , how accurate uh Jane 's uh uh labels were as far as {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Well , not just the overlaps , everything .\nPhD F: you know , did she miss some overlaps ? or did she n ?\nPhD D: But , by {disfmarker} by the moment , I {disfmarker} I don't compare , my {disfmarker} my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I {disfmarker} I want to do it . Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the {disfmarker} in the marks , I {disfmarker} and if I {disfmarker} I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can correct and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: Well , also Jane {disfmarker} Jane was doing word level .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: So we weren't concerned with {comment} exactly when an overlap started and stopped .\nPhD F: Right . Right .\nPhD C: Well , not only a word level , but actually\nPhD D: Well {disfmarker}\nPhD F: I 'm expect I 'm not expecting {disfmarker}\nPhD D: No , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I mean , you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption , you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPostdoc B: Well {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Well , yeah , b yeah , I would say time bin . So my {disfmarker} my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , {pause} beginning and end point .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: And {disfmarker} and sometimes , you know , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: but , yeah , w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that {disfmarker} i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken , it would have {disfmarker} it would have been hard with the interface that we have .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Now , my {disfmarker} a Adam 's working on a of course , on a revised overlapping interface ,\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} it 's a good eh work ,\nPostdoc B: but {disfmarker}\nPhD D: but eh I think we need eh eh more information .\nPhD F: No , of course .\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD F: I expect you to find more overlaps than {disfmarker} than Jane\nGrad G: Always need more for {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD D: No , no . I {disfmarker} I have to go to {disfmarker}\nPhD F: because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level .\nPhD D: I want eh {disfmarker} I wanted to eh compare the {disfmarker} the transcription .\nProfessor E: I have {disfmarker}\nGrad G: But if it takes sixty to one {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Well , I but I have a suggestion about that . Um , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting , but in the interests of making progress , uh might I s how {disfmarker} how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ?\nPhD D: Only .\nProfessor E: Yes .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Do not mark any other events ,\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: but only mark speaker {disfmarker} Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ?\nPhD D: OK . OK . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I w I {disfmarker} I wanted to {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Do y do you think that would speed it up ? Uh , speed up your {disfmarker} your {disfmarker} your marking ?\nPhD D: nnn , I don't understand very .\nProfessor E: It took you a long time {pause} to mark twelve minutes .\nPhD D: Yeah . Oh , yeah , yeah .\nProfessor E: Now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three {disfmarker}\nPhD D: On - only to mark {disfmarker} only to mark overlapping zone , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ?\nPhD D: Oh , yeah . Sure .\nProfessor E: Yeah OK .\nPhD D: Yeah sure .\nProfessor E: Then I think it 's a good idea .\nPhD D: Sure sure .\nProfessor E: Then I think it 's a good idea , because it\nPhD D: Sure , because I {disfmarker} I need a lot of time to {disfmarker} to put the label or to do that . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise .\nGrad G: And\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: There 's {disfmarker} there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth , and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: and {disfmarker} and something in between with paper rustling . We know that all that 's there and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study , but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Whereas th i I would think that uh you {disfmarker} we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking .\nPhD D: Uh - huh . OK . OK .\nProfessor E: So . Then you can get the {disfmarker} Cuz you need {disfmarker} If it 's three hundred uh {disfmarker} i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: And {disfmarker} and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of {disfmarker} of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics .\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD C: Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Well , that 's {disfmarker} That 's what I was gonna bring up .\nPhD C: I mean , you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand ,\nProfessor E: Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation .\nPhD C: right ? I 'm sorry .\nProfessor E: So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as {disfmarker} I mean there 's a bunch of things {disfmarker} I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . In the far - field mike .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: Oh , OK .\nProfessor E: Um , and uh , it 's not obvious , I mean , you could {disfmarker} you could do the dumbest thing and get {disfmarker} get it ninety percent of the time . But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the {disfmarker} you know , the right detector . So the idea is to have some ground truth first . And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say \" OK this , i you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really here \" .\nPhD A: But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ?\nPhD C: What I mean is {pause} get it from the close - talking mikes .\nProfessor E: Uh , yeah .\nPhD C: A or ge get a first pass from those ,\nProfessor E: We t we t w we t we talked about that .\nPhD C: and then go through sort of {disfmarker} It 'd be a lot faster probably to {disfmarker}\nPhD F: And you can {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , that 's his , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we talked about that . s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is ,\nPhD C: Yeah , I just {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway , and {disfmarker} and then whatever he could mark would be helpful ,\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor E: and we could {disfmarker} Uh it 's a question of what you bootstrap from . You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then {disfmarker} then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike . I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time .\nPhD C: Well , that 's what I wonder , because um {disfmarker} or how bad it is ,\nProfessor E: Well\nPhD C: be um , because that would be interesting\nGrad G: I 'm working on a program to do that , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . Right ? I mean , we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for . We have the audio data , we have the close - talking mike ,\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: so I mean it seems like one kind of project that 's not perfect , but {disfmarker} um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech ,\nProfessor E: Right , we discussed that .\nPhD C: you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ?\nGrad G: And {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Oh .\nGrad G: I 've {disfmarker} I 've written a program to do that ,\nPhD C: OK , I 'm sorry I missed the {disfmarker}\nGrad G: and it , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: It 's OK .\nGrad G: and {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} but it 's {disfmarker} it 's doing something very , very simple . It just takes a threshold , based on {disfmarker} on the volume ,\nPhD C: Uh - huh .\nPhD F: Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand .\nPhD C: Right , by hand . Yeah .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad G: um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs . And , it seems to work , I 've {disfmarker} I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something , and I haven't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} what I 'm working on {disfmarker} was working on {disfmarker} was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , {pause} into Transcriber . And so {disfmarker} I told {disfmarker} I said it would take about a day . I 've worked on it for about half a day ,\nGrad H: I have to go .\nGrad G: so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with .\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor E: See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working , because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided ,\nPhD C: Right . I 'm sorry . I just {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: but I couldn't remember all of it .\nPhD C: It\nProfessor E: So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when {disfmarker} when he {disfmarker} he gets his thing going ,\nGrad G: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: uh , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: That was {disfmarker} that was exactly the notion that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that we discussed .\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad G: Thanks .\nPostdoc B: Another thing we discussed was um that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: It looks good .\nProfessor E: So .\nPhD C: I 'll be in touch . Thanks .\nProfessor E: S See ya . Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Was that um there m {pause} there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written , {comment} that uh handle bleedthrough , I mean cuz you have this {disfmarker} this close {disfmarker} you have contamination from other people who speak loudly .\nGrad G: Yeah , and I haven't tried using that . It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that . It 's a cross - correlation filter . So I {disfmarker} I haven't tried that , but that {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it might be something {disfmarker} it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little .\nPostdoc B: So , some thought of maybe having {disfmarker} Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours .\nGrad G: Exactly . Yep .\nProfessor E: But {disfmarker} but that 's a refinement\nPostdoc B: That 's what we were discussing .\nProfessor E: and I think we wanna see {disfmarker} try the simple thing first , cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first .\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: But uh , having {disfmarker} having somebody have some experience , again , with {disfmarker} with uh {disfmarker} with marking it from a human standpoint , we 're {disfmarker} I mean , I don't expect Jose to {disfmarker} to do it for uh f fifty hours of {disfmarker} {comment} of speech , but I mean we {disfmarker} {comment} if uh {disfmarker} if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it .\nPhD D: Yeah . Sure . Sure .\nProfessor E: And when {disfmarker} when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different .\nPhD C: Oh yeah , definitely .\nPhD A: You know , I did {disfmarker} I did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty well . I mean , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs . And uh , you know , you can {disfmarker}\nGrad G: It seemed like the right thing to do .\nPhD A: Yeah . I mean , you {disfmarker} you can get y I mean , you get them pretty close .\nGrad G: That was with zero literature search .\nPhD A: And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to {disfmarker} to do it .\nGrad G: That 's good validation .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Is this proprietary ?\nPhD A: Uh . {comment} No . No .\nGrad G: Yeah , do you have a patent on it ?\nPhD A: It was when I was working for the government .\nProfessor E: Oh , then everybody owns it . It 's the people .\nPostdoc B: Well , I mean , is this something that we could just co - opt , or is it {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Nah .\nPostdoc B: No . OK .\nProfessor E: Well , i i i he 's pretty close , anyway . I think {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , he 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it doesn't take a long time .\nPostdoc B: Right . I just thought if it was tried and true , then {disfmarker} {comment} and he 's gone through additional levels of {disfmarker} of development .\nGrad G: Just output . Although if you {disfmarker} if you have some parameters like what 's a good window size for the median filter {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh ! {comment} I have to remember . I 'll think about it , and try to remember .\nPhD F: And it might be different for government people .\nGrad G: That 's alright .\nProfessor E: Yeah , good enough for government work , as they say .\nPhD C: They {disfmarker} they {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Di - dif different {disfmarker} different bandwidth .\nPhD F: They\nGrad G: I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , {comment} sorts of numbers .\nPhD F: OK .\nProfessor E: Uh , I don't know , it {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we want to uh {disfmarker} So , uh , maybe we should move on to other {disfmarker} other things in limited time .\nPostdoc B: Can I ask one question about his statistics ? So {disfmarker} so in the tw twelve minutes , um , if we took three hundred and divided it by four , which is about the length of twelve minutes , i Um , I 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Did you find uh more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD D: More than ?\nPostdoc B: More than {disfmarker} How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ?\nPhD D: How many ? Eh , not @ @ I Onl - only I {disfmarker} I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD D: but eh I {disfmarker} I don't co eh {disfmarker} I don't count eh the {disfmarker} the overlap .\nPostdoc B: The overlaps . OK .\nPhD D: I consider I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} the nnn {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} the three hundred is eh considered only you {disfmarker} your transcription . I have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to finish transcribing . So .\nGrad G: I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than {disfmarker} than sort of the middle .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Middle or end .\nPostdoc B: I 'm not sure .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Because i we 're {disfmarker} we 're dealing with the {disfmarker} Uh , in the early meetings , we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , {comment} and things like that ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: and that seems to be a lot of overlap .\nPostdoc B: I think it 's an empirical question .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: I think we could find that out .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPostdoc B: I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not sure that the beginning had more .\nProfessor E: So {disfmarker} so I was gonna ask , I guess about any {disfmarker} any other things that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that either of you wanted to talk about , especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes , that {disfmarker} that you wanna go with .\nPhD C: Can I just ask about the data , like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data , just cuz I 'm {disfmarker} I wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what {disfmarker} what can be done first and like how many meetings are we recording\nProfessor E: Right so there 's this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point . Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM . Right ? And then we don't know .\nPhD C: How many meetings is that ? Like {disfmarker} how many {disfmarker}\nGrad G: What 's that ?\nProfessor E: That was about ten hours , and there was about {disfmarker}\nPhD C: t ten {disfmarker} It 's like ten meetings or something ? Uh - huh .\nGrad G: Yeah , something like that . And then {disfmarker} then we\nPhD A: Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the {pause} missing files .\nProfessor E: Oh . Oh , that 's right , that had {disfmarker} those have not been sent .\nPhD A: H how many total have we recorded now , altogether ?\nProfessor E: We 're saying about {pause} twelve hours .\nGrad G: About twelve {pause} by now . Twelve or thirteen .\nPhD C: Uh - huh . And we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously we 're only recording this one now ? or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor E: No . No , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the biggest one {disfmarker} uh , chunk so far ,\nGrad G: Nope .\nPhD A: It was the morning one .\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor E: but there 's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys .\nGrad G: Jerry .\nPhD C: Do they meet every week ,\nProfessor E: And then there {disfmarker}\nPhD C: or every {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Uh , they do . w w And we talked to them about recording some more and we 're going to , uh , we 've started having a morning meeting , today uh i starting a w a week or two ago , on the uh front - end issues , and we 're recording those , uh there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded ,\nPhD C: Great .\nProfessor E: and we 're gonna start recording them . They 're {disfmarker} They meet on Tuesdays . We 're gonna start recording them next week . So actually , we 're gonna h start having a {disfmarker} a pretty significant chunk and so , you know , {vocalsound} Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff {disfmarker} things like that , now that uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the things are starting to happen . So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings , but there are scattered other meetings in it and that {disfmarker} that amount is gonna grow uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately {disfmarker} i if we 're {disfmarker} if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it , not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not eighty or ninety . But .\nPhD C: So there 's probably {disfmarker} there 's three to four a week ,\nGrad G: That 's what we 're aiming for .\nPhD C: that we 're aiming for .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And they 're each about an hour or something .\nProfessor E: Yeah , yeah .\nGrad G: Although {disfmarker} Yeah . We 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker} OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah and th the {disfmarker} the other thing is I 'm not pos I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really don't know {disfmarker} maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty , but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: Because it 's just an added bunch of weird stuff .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: And , you know , we {disfmarker} we h we 're highly motivated . Uh in fact , the morning group is really motivated cuz they 're working on connected digits , so it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Actually that 's something I wanted to ask , is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those .\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance . But I haven't been ru I haven't been doing that . Um , if I did that , is someone gonna be working on it ?\nProfessor E: Uh , yeah , I {disfmarker} I think definitely s so Absolutely .\nGrad G: I mean , is it something of interest ?\nProfessor E: Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that .\nGrad G: OK . I mean , I I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm interested in it , I just don't have time to do it now .\nPhD F: I was {disfmarker} these meetings {disfmarker} I 'm sure someone thought of this , but these {disfmarker} this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation .\nGrad G: So\nPhD F: Um .\nGrad G: Yep . Yep .\nPhD C: Actually I have o\nGrad G: I {disfmarker} I would really like someone to do adaptation .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder .\nProfessor E: Well {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things I wanted to do , uh , that I I talked to {disfmarker} to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation ,\nGrad G: Since it 's the same people over and over .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: to try to get rid of some of the effects of the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the far - field effects . Um , I mean we have {disfmarker} the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: because people move around , and uh , if {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's uh not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} you can't really do inversion ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something {disfmarker} It may {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we 've taken is more \" lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal \" .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Uh , that 's the party line . But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous . It 's good {disfmarker} {vocalsound} good to sort of test them , actually . And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do . So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation . Um , there was a {disfmarker} have been some nice talks recently by {disfmarker} by Lucent on {disfmarker} on their b\nPhD F: Hmm .\nProfessor E: the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me , uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . {comment} And um , you know , th\nPhD A: W what is the um {disfmarker} the artifact you try to {disfmarker} you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?\nPhD F: Ciao .\nProfessor E: Uh so it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} you have a {disfmarker} a direct uh {disfmarker} Uh , what 's the difference in {disfmarker} If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um {disfmarker}\nPhD F: I 'm signing off .\nProfessor E: Yeah . that would subtract off {comment} the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so {disfmarker} so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation {disfmarker} Yeah , so you {disfmarker} Given that um {disfmarker} Yeah , so you 're trying to {disfmarker} So you 'd {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself {disfmarker} adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract {disfmarker} essentially to subtract off uh different uh {disfmarker} different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had {disfmarker} you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a {disfmarker} there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .\nPhD A: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would {disfmarker} you might hear kind of an echo ? And {disfmarker} and then this {disfmarker} noise cancellation would get\nProfessor E: Well , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm saying {disfmarker} That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . {comment} What 's really happening is {disfmarker} Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you {disfmarker} To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the {disfmarker} the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the {disfmarker} the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to use this uh {disfmarker} this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this {disfmarker} this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh {disfmarker} gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to {disfmarker} you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um {disfmarker} uh with some constraints .\nPhD A: Kind of a clean up thing , that {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: It 's a clean up thing . Right .\nPhD A: OK .\nProfessor E: So , echo cancelling is {disfmarker} is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you {disfmarker} if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .\nPhD A: When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um {disfmarker} some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh {disfmarker} And then it would come on and it was very clear ,\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD A: you know .\nProfessor E: Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try {disfmarker} somebody look {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data {disfmarker} plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh . {vocalsound} Um\nPostdoc B: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?\nProfessor E: Brian 's {comment} Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know {disfmarker} There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right {disfmarker} the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those {disfmarker} those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right {disfmarker} you know , right {disfmarker} right uh {disfmarker} delays are {disfmarker} is , uh {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} right delayed signal is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a {disfmarker} in a situation that 's very reverberant {disfmarker} {comment} with long reverberation times {comment} and really long delays , it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a {disfmarker} a c a complete inversion , if you actually {disfmarker} I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the {disfmarker} the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you {disfmarker} you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and {disfmarker} and uh goes to infinity . So it 's {disfmarker} so there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents {disfmarker} I mean there 's all sorts of {disfmarker} all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking {disfmarker} uh , just picking uh features , which were {disfmarker} uh will give you more {disfmarker} something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was {disfmarker} I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you {disfmarker} you actually already said this thing about the uh {disfmarker} about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to {disfmarker} So this was the human subjects folks who said this , {comment} or that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} ?\nPostdoc B: The a apparently {disfmarker} I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it {pause} that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .\nProfessor E: OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that {disfmarker} that we have . We have {disfmarker} we have an hour uh that {disfmarker} that is transcribed , we have {disfmarker} we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we {disfmarker} if this really uh {disfmarker} Well , do we have that much ?\nPhD C: Not really . It 's three to four per week .\nProfessor E: Let 's see , we have {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So that 's what {disfmarker} You know , that {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: uh eight weeks , uh is {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So that 's not a lot of hours .\nProfessor E: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's {disfmarker} Yeah , so like thirty {disfmarker} thirty hours ?\nPhD A: Three {disfmarker} Three hours .\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean , is there {disfmarker} I know this sounds {pause} tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this {vocalsound} but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,\nProfessor E: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .\nPhD C: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .\nPhD C: I mean , is there {disfmarker} Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them {comment} or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong {disfmarker}\nGrad G: We had some good ones earlier .\nPhD C: There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I think it 's hard to record those .\nPhD C: To be allowed to record them ?\nPostdoc B: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah , people will get {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: But I {disfmarker} but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .\nPhD C: OK . Well , if there is , anyway .\nProfessor E: Yeah , I was gonna mention that .\nGrad G: Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's {disfmarker} That would be a good match .\nProfessor E: Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . So I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh , I {disfmarker} I 'd mentioned to Adam , and {disfmarker} that was another thing I was gonna talk {disfmarker} uh , mention to them before {disfmarker} {comment} that uh there 's uh {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , {comment} that {disfmarker} that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and so it doesn't really give us the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show , {pause} or this {disfmarker} you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? \" And uh they may be willing to record it uh with {disfmarker}\nPhD C: With lapel mikes or something ?\nProfessor E: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it {disfmarker} it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor E: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they start recording , isn't {disfmarker} als also is not going to be this exact setup .\nPhD C: Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data .\nProfessor E: So , {comment} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , {comment} uh that we could invite them to have like some of their {disfmarker} {comment} record some of their shows here .\nPostdoc B: Wow !\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} Or {disfmarker} The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,\nGrad G: Right , as we are .\nPhD C: right ? So . {comment} Um , I think that 'd be fantastic\nProfessor E: Right .\nPhD C: cuz those kinds of panels and {disfmarker} Those have interesting\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: Th - that 's an {disfmarker} a side of style {disfmarker} a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great .\nProfessor E: And {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} I mean , the other side to it was the {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} which is where we were coming from {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you more about it later {comment} is that {disfmarker} is that there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and {disfmarker} and permissions and all that . I mean , they already do what they do {disfmarker} do whatever they do . So it 's {disfmarker} uh , it 's {disfmarker} So it 's {disfmarker} so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um {disfmarker} and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could {disfmarker} @ @ in the {disfmarker} under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Right . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , \" OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . And you {disfmarker} you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your {disfmarker} your data for awhile so um right now {disfmarker} and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right ? Do {disfmarker} Oh , do we now ?\nProfessor E: Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So um , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: and they 're pretty different , because\nProfessor E: Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you {disfmarker} you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like ,\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD C: um {disfmarker} Right . Right , right .\nProfessor E: and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can {disfmarker} you can do a lot of other things .\nPhD C: Cuz I 'm not actually sure , just logistically that I can spend {disfmarker} you know , I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time . And that 's {disfmarker} and especially with the student\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD C: uh for instance this guy who seems {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh anyway , I shouldn't say too much , but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person . And so it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now {disfmarker} Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh {disfmarker} which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .\nPhD C: And we just don't know about the transcription part of that ,\nProfessor E: So that 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Yeah , we need to {disfmarker} I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards ,\nPhD C: so . I mean , it {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions .\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: So I think that we 'll need to adjust some {disfmarker} And also if we wanna add things like um , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through . I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection . There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh , you know , friends , and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to , right ?\nProfessor E: If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @ {disfmarker} I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions , but I think if it 's a real {disfmarker} Why not ? Yeah .\nPhD C: I mean , I 'm thinking , politically {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Stage some political debates .\nPostdoc B: You could do this ,\nPhD C: Well yeah ,\nPostdoc B: you know . You could .\nPhD C: or just if you 're {disfmarker} if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't {pause} um have them do the digits , {comment} or maybe have them do a shorter {pause} digit thing {comment} like if it was , you know , uh , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do .\nGrad G: We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to .\nPhD C: Then , having the data is very valuable , cuz I think it 's um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the ITR , if we put in a proposal on it . It 'll just look like ICSI 's collected a lot more audio data . Um , whether it 's transcribed or not um , is another issue , but there 's {disfmarker} there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer .\nPostdoc B: It seems like you could hold some meetings .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPostdoc B: You know , you and maybe Adam ?\nPhD C: So .\nPostdoc B: You {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} you could maybe hold some additional meetings , if you wanted .\nPhD A: Would it help at all {disfmarker} I mean , we 're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings . One is uh um without doing the digits {disfmarker} Or , I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits , what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff .\nPhD C: Need the close - talking mikes .\nPhD A: You do , OK .\nPhD C: I mean , absolutely ,\nProfessor E: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: yeah . I 'm really scared {disfmarker}\nGrad G: It seems like it 's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes .\nPhD A: I see , OK .\nPhD C: Um or at least , like , me personally ? I would {disfmarker} {comment} I {disfmarker} couldn't use that data .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: I agree . And Mari also ,\nPhD C: Um .\nPostdoc B: we had {disfmarker} This came up when she she was here . That 's important .\nPhD C: So it 's a great idea ,\nProfessor E: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} b By the {disfmarker} by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck .\nPhD C: and if it were true than I would just do that , but it 's not that bad {disfmarker} like the room is not the bottleneck , and we have enough time in the room , it 's getting the people to come in and put on the {disfmarker} and get the setup going .\nProfessor E: I think the issue is just that we 're {disfmarker} we 're blazing that path . Right ? And {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} d Do you have any idea when {disfmarker} when uh the {disfmarker} you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ?\nGrad G: Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad G: So it 'll be early next week .\nProfessor E: Yeah , OK . So early next week we send it to them , and then {disfmarker} then we check with them to see if they 've got it and we {disfmarker} we start , you know asking about the timing for it .\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on .\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: Right ?\nGrad G: Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , who knows where they are .\nPhD A: Have they ever responded to you ?\nGrad G: Nope .\nProfessor E: Yeah , but {disfmarker} You know , so they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they have {disfmarker} you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do ,\nPhD C: What if {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , you {disfmarker} we can't complain .\nProfessor E: right ? But they {disfmarker} But at any rate , they 'll {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think once they get that sorted out , they 're {disfmarker} they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they {disfmarker} who 's {disfmarker} who is doing it , and uh I think it 's not going to be {disfmarker} I don't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour , I think . It 's not going to be thirty\nGrad G: Yep . I think that 's probably true .\nPhD C: Really ? So it 's the amount of {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: It 's {disfmarker} it 's just getting it going .\nGrad G: It 's pipeline , pipeline issues .\nPhD C: Right . What about these lunch meetings {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Once the pipeline fills .\nPhD C: I mean , I don't know , if there 's any way without too much more overhead , even if we don't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile , {comment} to record you know , two or three more meeting a week , just to have the data , even if they 're um not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ?\nProfessor E: But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No , I meant , um , sorry , the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs , maybe they don't wanna be recorded , but {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Oh , and we 're just chatting ?\nPhD C: Just the ch the chatting .\nGrad G: Yeah , we have a lot of those .\nPhD C: I actually {disfmarker} I actually think that 's {pause} useful {pause} data , um {pause} the chatting ,\nGrad G: Yeah , the problem with that is I would {disfmarker} I think I would feel a little constrained to {disfmarker} You know ? Uh , some of the meetings {disfmarker}\nPhD C: but {disfmarker} OK . You don't wanna do it , cuz {disfmarker} OK .\nGrad G: You know , our \" soccer ball \" meeting ?\nPhD C: Alright .\nGrad G: I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting .\nPhD C: Alright , {comment} so I 'll just throw it out there , if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI , um that we could record , I think it would be worth it .\nGrad G: That was hilarious .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they {disfmarker} because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . So then that would double {pause} what we had . Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW uh {disfmarker} I mean really m a lot more {comment} than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: so .\nPhD A: Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ?\nProfessor E: Uh , {vocalsound} they seem to have some problems with it . We can {disfmarker} we can talk about that later . Um , but , again , Jerry is {disfmarker} Jerry 's open {disfmarker} So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh Jerry was open to it but I {disfmarker} I s One of the things that I think is a little {disfmarker} a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week . You know ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that people are gonna feel uh {disfmarker} are gonna feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . And the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} so then they can just really sort of try to {disfmarker} put the mikes on and then just charge in and {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: What if we give people {disfmarker} you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?\nPostdoc B: Well , you know , I {disfmarker} I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .\nPhD C: OK .\nPostdoc B: But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,\nPhD C: Alright , alright , alright .\nPostdoc B: but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial . I mean , we could {disfmarker} political discussions , or {disfmarker} or something or other ,\nPhD C: No , definitely .\nPostdoc B: and i you know , people who are {disfmarker} Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh goldibears {disfmarker} goldi goldilocks , it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . And um {disfmarker} a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word .\nPhD A: Well , even {disfmarker} I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about\nPostdoc B: We could pay subjects .\nPhD A: or what about people in the {disfmarker} in the building ?\nPhD C: Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo\nPhD A: I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: So I {disfmarker} I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition\nPhD C: Alright , well .\nGrad G: and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \" , but then I got email from them that said \" no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . \" So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .\nPhD A: What about Joachim , maybe he can {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: But {disfmarker} but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . And I {disfmarker} I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the {disfmarker} with the radio .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .\nPhD C: Well , and they 're already {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} these things are already recorded ,\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: we don't have to ask them to {disfmarker} even {disfmarker} and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: n Well {disfmarker} No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones\nPhD C: Why {disfmarker} why not ?\nProfessor E: because {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} because we would be asking them to do something different .\nPhD C: Well , we can find out . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in {disfmarker} in LDC getting {pause} data , uh , and {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Right , that 's the found data idea .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: And u I think routinely they would not do this . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere\nPhD C: Right . Great . OK .  \nProfessor E: and uh {disfmarker} But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I might be able to talk them into it .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here .\nPhD C: That 's a good way to end a meeting .\nProfessor E: OK . Well I don't {disfmarker} why don't we {disfmarker} why d u why don't we uh uh turn them {disfmarker} turn\nGrad G: OK , leave {disfmarker} leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time .\nPostdoc B: Oh . That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: Turning off the microphone made it crash . Well {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: OK .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was said on speech overlap?\nAnswer:", "input": "What was said on speech overlap?", "context": "Professor E: So . OK . Doesn't look like it crashed . That 's great .\nGrad G: So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working . And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash . So , I won't do that anymore .\nPostdoc B: And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the {disfmarker} without having people have to give their names each time ?\nPhD A: Sounds like an initialization thing .\nPostdoc B: I mean it 's like you have the {disfmarker} So you know that {disfmarker}\nGrad G: No .\nPostdoc B: I mean , are you going to write down {pause} that I sat here ?\nGrad G: I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .\nPostdoc B: OK .\nPhD C: Oh , OK .\nGrad G: So {disfmarker} So they should be right with what 's on the digit forms . OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits . u And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .\nProfessor E: And start by giving the transcript number .\nPhD A: Tran\nPhD D: Transcript {disfmarker} Uh . OK , OK .\nPhD A: Oh sorry , go ahead .\nProfessor E: So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .\nGrad H: OK .\nProfessor E: It 's just uh {disfmarker}\nGrad H: Umh .\nProfessor E: Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have {comment} that information .\nGrad G: And I 'm surprised I sort of {disfmarker} I 'm surprised I forgot that ,\nProfessor E: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's some\nGrad G: but uh I think that would be a good thing to add . After I just printed out a zillion of them .\nProfessor E: Yeah , well , that 's {disfmarker} Um , so I {disfmarker} I do have a {disfmarker} a an agenda suggestion . Uh , we {disfmarker} I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we {disfmarker} we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So {vocalsound} uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and {disfmarker} and uh sort of we have {disfmarker} anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the {disfmarker} the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a {disfmarker} a couple weeks before um uh about the uh {disfmarker} the stuff you were doing with {disfmarker} with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: like some other noise .\nPhD D: Uh - huh . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .\nPhD D: To\nProfessor E: So at any rate you were {disfmarker} you 've {disfmarker} you 've done some work on that\nPhD D: right .\nProfessor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you {disfmarker} you haven't been in {disfmarker} in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that {disfmarker} that uh {disfmarker} that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some um uh work about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I {disfmarker} I don't want to try to say cuz I {disfmarker} I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some {disfmarker} some potential collaboration there about {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} working with these data .\nPhD C: Oh . Sure .\nProfessor E: So . So , uh .\nGrad G: You wanna just go around ?\nProfessor E: Uh . {pause} Well , I don't know if we {disfmarker} if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple {disfmarker} a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't {disfmarker} Actually I think that {disfmarker} that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you {disfmarker} you start with that .\nPostdoc B: OK . Shall I {disfmarker} shall I just start ? OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .\nPostdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of {disfmarker} you know , relating to his {disfmarker} to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this {disfmarker} this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how {pause} um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the causal aspects of the uh floor and {disfmarker} and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it {disfmarker} {comment} These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , {comment} and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And {disfmarker} and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now {pause} we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know . So it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {pause} i What you {disfmarker} what you int what you draw {disfmarker} you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,\nGrad G: Hmm , metaphorically .\nPostdoc B: that um , i that {pause} i we have enough space , and he continues , like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \" . So you have to sort of get the idea that um , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far . But there are a lot of different things like that .\nGrad G: So , do you think his interest is in using this as {pause} a data source , or {pause} training material , or what ?\nProfessor E: Well , I {disfmarker} I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're {disfmarker} already have and see , is there anything to this at all ?\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it . Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say \" well , this is just the wrong {pause} task for {disfmarker} for him to pursue his {disfmarker} \"\nGrad G: Wrong , yeah .\nProfessor E: And {disfmarker} and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that {disfmarker} that you looked at that {disfmarker} that it 's plausible at least .\nPostdoc B: It 's possible . Uh , he was {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} We met and he was gonna go and uh you know , y look through them more systematically\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: and then uh meet again .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: So it 's , you know , not a matter of a {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: But , yeah , I think {disfmarker} I think it was optimistic .\nProfessor E: So anyway , that 's {disfmarker} that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might {disfmarker} might {disfmarker} might come out from some of this .\nPhD C: But he can use text , basically . I mean , he 's talking about just using text\nPostdoc B: That 's his major {disfmarker} I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours\nPhD C: pretty much , or {disfmarker} ?\nPostdoc B: and {pause} that wasn't as directly relevant to what he 's doing . He 's interested in these {disfmarker} these knowledge structures ,\nPhD C: OK .\nPhD D: Yeah , interesting .\nPostdoc B: inferences that you draw {pause} i from {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: I mean , he certainly could use text , but we were in fact looking to see if there {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in this stuff . So .\nGrad G: And I imagine that transcripts of speech {disfmarker} I mean text that is speech {disfmarker} probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing . I {disfmarker} I don't know whether it would or not , but it seems like it would .\nProfessor E: I don't know , probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing was . But .\nPostdoc B: Yeah , I don't think I would make that leap , because i in narratives , you know {disfmarker} I mean , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious ,\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc B: so .\nGrad G: Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're {disfmarker} when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel and {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Oh . That aspect .\nGrad G: Yeah . And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face . I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying \" we 're ahead of the game \" {comment} in that {disfmarker} in that context ,\nPostdoc B: Well {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad G: I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else .\nPostdoc B: I {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them .\nGrad G: Uh - huh .\nPostdoc B: This {disfmarker} this one really does um m make you leap from {disfmarker} So he said , you know , \" we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling \" .\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc B: And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I guess it would be the same .\nPostdoc B: Uh - huh . But there are others that have backchannelling , it 's just he was less interested in those .\nPhD F: Can I {disfmarker} Sorry to interrupt . Um , I f f f I 've {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} d A minute {disfmarker} uh , several minutes ago , I , like , briefly was {disfmarker} was not listening and {disfmarker} So who is \" he \" in this context ?\nPhD C: Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun {disfmarker}\nPhD F: OK . So I was just realizing we 've {disfmarker} You guys have been talking about \" he \" um for at least uh , I don't know , three {disfmarker} three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again .\nPhD C: I believe it . Yeah . Actually to make it worse , {comment} uh , Morgan uses \" you \" and \" you \"\nPhD F: So this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} gonna be a big , big problem if you want to later do uh , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort .\nGrad G: It 's in my notes .\nPhD C: with gaze and no identification , or {disfmarker} I just wrote this down . Yeah , actually . Cuz Morgan will say well , \" you had some ideas \"\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD F: You just wrote this ?\nPhD C: and he never said Li - He looked {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Well , I think he 's doing that intentionally ,\nPhD C: Right , so it 's great .\nGrad G: aren't you ?\nPhD C: So this is really great\nPhD F: Right .\nPhD C: because the thing is , because he 's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics . Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice .\nProfessor E: Uh - huh . Could be .\nPostdoc B: Can we\nProfessor E: Yeah . That would be tou\nGrad G: Oh , that would be interesting .\nPhD C: Yeah , so that , I mean , to even know um when {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice .\nGrad G: Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell .\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad G: Uh .\nPostdoc B: Oh , but you 'd have the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Put Morgan always like this\nPostdoc B: You 'd have fainter {disfmarker}\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here ?\nProfessor E: Well , these {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ? Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking , now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking , I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference .\nPhD C: But you don't have this {disfmarker} this problem .\nPostdoc B: I see .\nPhD C: Morgan is the one who does this most .\nGrad G: So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you .\nProfessor E: I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about {disfmarker} and concerns about \" oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? \" and so on .\nGrad G: Lawyers .\nProfessor E: And so I {disfmarker} so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though uh {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: I am too .\nPhD C: Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at .\nPostdoc B: I am too .\nGrad G: And we did mention who \" he \" was .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD F: Right , but I missed it .\nGrad G: Early in the conversation .\nPhD F: But {disfmarker} it was uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: Do {disfmarker} Sh - Can I say\nProfessor E: Yeah . No no , there 's {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad G: or {disfmarker} or is that just too sensitive ?\nProfessor E: No no , it isn't sensitive at all .\nPostdoc B: Well {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: I was just {disfmarker} I was just {disfmarker} I was overreacting just because we 've been talking about it .\nPostdoc B: And in fact , it is {disfmarker} it is {disfmarker} it is sensitive .\nPhD C: No , but that {disfmarker} it 's interesting .\nProfessor E: It 's OK to {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: I {disfmarker} I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention . I mean , it fits into the m area of the mundane , but they did say {disfmarker} You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says \" no individuals will be identified uh , \" in any publication using the data . \" OK , well , individuals being identified , let 's say you have a {disfmarker} a snippet that says , \" Joe s uh thinks such - and - such about {disfmarker} about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . \" Now I mean , we 're {disfmarker} we 're gonna be careful not to have the \" wrongheaded \" part in there , but {disfmarker} but you know , let 's say we say , you know , \" Joe used to think so - and - so about this area , in his publication he says that but I think he 's changed his mind . \" or whatever . Then the issue of {disfmarker} of being able to trace Joe , because we know he 's well - known in this field , and all this and {disfmarker} and tie it to the speaker , whose name was just mentioned a moment ago , can be sensitive .\nProfessor E: b But I {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: So I think it 's really {disfmarker} really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there 's a slanderous aspect to it , then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove ?\nProfessor E: Yeah , well , there 's that . But I {disfmarker} I mean I think also to some extent it 's just educating the Human Subjects people , in a way , because there 's {disfmarker} If uh {disfmarker} You know , there 's court transcripts , there 's {disfmarker} there 's transcripts of radio shows {disfmarker} I mean people say people 's names all the time . So I think it {disfmarker} it can't be bad to say people 's names . It 's just that {disfmarker} i I mean you 're right that there 's more poten If we never say anybody 's name , then there 's no chance of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of slandering anybody ,\nPhD C: But , then it won't {disfmarker} I mean , if we {disfmarker} if we {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: but {disfmarker}\nGrad G: It 's not a meeting .\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean we should do whatever 's natural in a meeting if {disfmarker} if we weren't being recorded .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Right , so I {disfmarker} So my behavior is probably not natural .\nPhD C: \" If Person X {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor E: So .\nPostdoc B: Well , my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it , you know .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD F: Well , if you ha since you have to um go over the transcripts later anyway , you could make it one of the jobs of the {pause} people who do that to mark\nGrad G: Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization .\nPhD F: Right .\nGrad G: If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name . And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that .\nProfessor E: Yeah , we really can't . But a actually , I 'm sorry . I really would like to push {disfmarker} finish this off .\nPostdoc B: I understand . No I just {disfmarker} I just was suggesting that it 's not a bad policy p potentially .\nProfessor E: So it 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: So , we need to talk about this later .\nProfessor E: Yeah , I di I didn't intend it an a policy though .\nPostdoc B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: It was {disfmarker} it was just it was just unconscious {disfmarker} well , semi - conscious behavior . I sorta knew I was doing it but it was {disfmarker}\nPhD F: Well , I still don't know who \" he \" is .\nProfessor E: I {disfmarker} I do I don't remember who \" he \" is .\nPhD C: No , you have to say , you still don't know who \" he \" is , with that prosody .\nProfessor E: Ah . Uh , we were talking about Dan at one point {comment} and we were talking about Lokendra at another point .\nPostdoc B: Yeah , depends on which one you mean .\nProfessor E: And I don't {disfmarker} I don't remember which {disfmarker} which part .\nPhD F: Oh .\nPhD C: It 's ambiguous , so it 's OK .\nProfessor E: Uh , I think {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Well , the inference structures was Lokendra .\nPhD F: But no . The inference stuff was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} was Lokendra .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD F: OK . That makes sense , yeah .\nPhD C: And the downsampling must have been Dan .\nProfessor E: Um {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Good {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's an inference .\nProfessor E: Yeah , you could do all these inferences , yeah .\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Um , I {disfmarker} I would like to move it into {disfmarker} into uh what Jose uh has been doing\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nProfessor E: because he 's actually been doing something .\nPhD D: Uh - huh . OK .\nProfessor E: So . {vocalsound} Right .\nPhD F: As opposed to the rest of us .\nPhD D: Well - {comment} {vocalsound} OK . I {disfmarker} I remind that me {disfmarker} my first objective eh , in the project is to {disfmarker} to study difference parameters to {disfmarker} to find a {disfmarker} a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . But eh , {vocalsound} tsk , {comment} {vocalsound} ehhh {comment} In that way {comment} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I begin to {disfmarker} to study and to analyze the ehn {disfmarker} the recorded speech eh the different session to {disfmarker} to find and to locate and to mark eh the {disfmarker} the different overlapping zone . And eh so eh I was eh {disfmarker} I am transcribing the {disfmarker} the first session and I {disfmarker} I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , eh {disfmarker} {comment} I don't know what is the different names eh you use to {disfmarker} to name the {disfmarker} the {pause} n speech\nPhD A: Nonspeech sounds ?\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Oh , I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail . So .\nPhD D: Yeah . Eh , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do I don't need to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to mmm {vocalsound} {disfmarker} to m to label the {disfmarker} the different acoustic , but I prefer because eh I would like to {disfmarker} to study if eh , I {disfmarker} I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to test these parameters eh with the {disfmarker} another eh , eh acoustic events , to nnn {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to eh {disfmarker} to find what is the ehm {disfmarker} the false {disfmarker} eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the {disfmarker} the ehm {disfmarker} this eh parameter {disfmarker} eh I mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: You know {disfmarker} I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there 's two there .\nGrad G: So it was {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: I mean , if it 's a tapping sound , you wouldn't necessarily {disfmarker} or , you know , something like that , it 'd be {disfmarker} it might be hard to know that it was two separate events .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad G: Well {disfmarker} You weren't talking about just overlaps\nPhD D: Ye\nGrad G: were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general ,\nGrad G: Someone starts , someone stops {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD D: but eh my {disfmarker} my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone .\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Eh ? {comment} n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events .\nProfessor E: How many overlaps were there uh in it ? No no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ?\nPhD D: How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session\nGrad G: Oh , God !\nPhD D: in five {disfmarker} eh in forty - five minutes .\nPhD A: Three hundred overlapping speech {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone .\nGrad G: Ugh .\nPhD C: Overlapping speech .\nPhD D: With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech {disfmarker} speech what eh different duration .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Sure .\nPostdoc B: Does this {disfmarker} ? So if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ?\nPhD D: Yeah , three people , two people . Eh , um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , be\nProfessor E: No no , but I think what she 's asking is {pause} if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ?\nPhD D: Oh . Oh . Yeah . I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone . This {disfmarker} th I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I con I consider {disfmarker} I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh {disfmarker} are talking together .\nGrad G: Well {disfmarker} So let 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: For\nGrad G: So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time , and then Liz starts talking also over all of us . How many events would that be ?\nPhD D: So - I don't understand .\nGrad G: So , two people are talking , {comment} and then a third person starts talking .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nGrad G: Is there an event right here ?\nPhD D: Eh no . No no . For me is the overlapping zone , because {disfmarker} because you {disfmarker} you have s you have more one {disfmarker} eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in a moment .\nProfessor E: I see .\nGrad G: So i if two or more people are talking .\nProfessor E: OK . Yeah . So I think {disfmarker} Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it .\nPhD D: Yeah . If\nProfessor E: So then , in the region between {disfmarker} since there {disfmarker} there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: Is it {disfmarker} Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: or are you calling the entire length of it the event ?\nPhD D: I consider the {disfmarker} the , nnn {disfmarker} the nnn , nnn {disfmarker} eh , the entirety eh , eh , all {disfmarker} all the time there were {disfmarker} the voice has overlapped .\nProfessor E: OK .\nPhD D: This is the idea . But eh I {disfmarker} I don't distinguish between the {disfmarker} the numbers of eh speaker . Uh , I 'm not considering {vocalsound} eh the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} ehm {vocalsound} eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ? Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking , and eh , eh a third person eh join to {disfmarker} to that . For me , it 's eh {disfmarker} it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event . Wi - but {disfmarker} uh , without any mark between the zone {disfmarker} of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , and the zone with the three speakers .\nPostdoc B: That would j just be one .\nPhD D: It {disfmarker} One . One .\nPostdoc B: OK .\nPhD D: Eh , with eh , a beginning mark and the ending mark . Because eh {vocalsound} for me , is the {disfmarker} is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral .\nProfessor E: Got it .\nPhD D: I don't mind {disfmarker} By the moment , by the moment .\nGrad G: Well , but {disfmarker} But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} Yeah , but eh {disfmarker} but eh I have to study . {comment} What will happen in a general way ,\nProfessor E: Could .\nGrad G: So . You had to start somewhere .\nProfessor E: Yeah . We just w\nPhD C: So there 's a lot of overlap .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't know what eh will {disfmarker} will happen with the {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: So .\nGrad G: That 's a lot of overlap ,\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nProfessor E: So again , that 's {disfmarker} that 's three {disfmarker} three hundred in forty - five minutes that are {disfmarker} that are speakers , just speakers .\nGrad G: yeah , for forty - five minutes .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Uh - huh . OK . Yeah .\nPostdoc B: But a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a th\nProfessor E: So that 's about eight per minute .\nPostdoc B: But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah , {pause} but {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD C: But that can include taps .\nPhD D: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Uh . Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot .\nPhD D: General .\nPhD C: Actually {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I con I consider {disfmarker} I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too .\nPostdoc B: Silent .\nGrad G: Silence starting or silence ending {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah , silent , ground to {disfmarker} bec to detect {disfmarker} eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech .\nPhD C: Oh , OK .\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD D: In ge in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in a general point of view .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor E: OK , so how many of those thousand were silence ?\nPhD C: Alright .\nPhD D: in the per\nPhD F: Not speech {disfmarker} not speech or too much speech .\nPhD D: Too much speech .\nProfessor E: Right . So how many of those thousand were silence , silent sections ?\nPhD D: Yeah . Uh silent , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't the {disfmarker} eh I {disfmarker} I would like to {disfmarker} to do a stylistic study\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD D: and give you eh with the report eh from eh the {disfmarker} the study from the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the session {disfmarker} one session .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: And I {disfmarker} I found that eh another thing . When eh {vocalsound} eh I w I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file , um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm {disfmarker} the mixed file , to {disfmarker} to transcribe , the {disfmarker} the events and the words , I {disfmarker} I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike {disfmarker} eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh {disfmarker} collected by headphone .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD D: And {disfmarker} It 's right .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD D: But the problem is {vocalsound} the following . The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different , but eh the {disfmarker} the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by {disfmarker} by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file . And so if {disfmarker} when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn {disfmarker} the mixed file , it 's possible {disfmarker} eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system , it 's possible you eh {disfmarker} in the eh i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh {disfmarker} to nnn {disfmarker} to do the experiments {pause} with the {disfmarker} the system ,\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD D: its possible to evaluate eh , eh {disfmarker} or to consider eh acoustic events that {disfmarker} which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the {disfmarker} by the mike .\nGrad G: Right . The {disfmarker} the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea . It 's a good idea I think .\nGrad G: So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: I mean , if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh {disfmarker} to eh {disfmarker} to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal .\nGrad G: So .\nPhD D: I mean the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the signal collected by the {disfmarker} eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to {disfmarker} to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm . The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the far - field , yeah .\nPhD D: you have to {disfmarker} to analyze {disfmarker} you have to {disfmarker} to process . Because I {disfmarker} I found a difference .\nProfessor E: Yeah , well , just {disfmarker} I mean , just in that {disfmarker} that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that {disfmarker} that we {disfmarker} we passed on to others a few months ago , there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and {disfmarker} and uh , in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could . So yeah , it 's clear that if you wanna study {disfmarker} if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use a distant mike .\nPhD F: That 's good .\nProfessor E: On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ?\nProfessor E: so it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad G: If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear Jane interrupting me , but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling . And so if you 're interested in {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I {disfmarker} I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem ,\nProfessor E: Some {comment} of it 's masking {disfmarker} masked .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ?\nProfessor E: Right .\nPhD C: right ?\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Although the other issue is that the {pause} mixed close - talking mikes {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that .\nPhD C: But it 's known .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: I mean , the normalization you do is over the whole conversation\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: isn't it , over the whole meeting .\nGrad G: Right . Yep .\nPhD C: So if you wanted to study people overlapping people , that 's not a problem .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think eh I saw the nnn {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} eh but eh I eh {disfmarker} I have eh any results . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I saw the {disfmarker} the speech file collected by eh the fet mike , and eh eh signal eh to eh {disfmarker} to noise eh relation is eh low . It 's low .\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: It 's very low . You would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD D: And I {disfmarker} I found that nnn {disfmarker} that eh , {vocalsound} ehm , pr probably ,\nGrad G: Did {disfmarker} Did you\nPhD D: I 'm not sure eh by the moment , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , {vocalsound} eh for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in several eh parts of the files where you {disfmarker} you can find eh , eh {vocalsound} eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the {disfmarker} in the meeting ,\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: it 's probably in {disfmarker} in that eh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in those files you {disfmarker} you can not find {disfmarker} you can not process because eh it 's confused with {disfmarker} with noise .\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: And there are {vocalsound} a lot of I think . But I have to study with more detail . But eh my idea is to {disfmarker} to process only {pause} nnn , this eh {disfmarker} nnn , this kind of s of eh speech . Because I think it 's more realistic . I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , but eh {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: No {disfmarker} i\nGrad G: Well , it 's more realistic but it 'll {disfmarker} it 'll be a lot harder .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your {disfmarker} if i if {disfmarker} if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people {disfmarker} people 's speech , you will {disfmarker} you will get that somewhat better .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Um , Are you making any use {disfmarker} uh you were {disfmarker} you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed .\nPhD D: With {disfmarker} By Jane .\nProfessor E: Does it uh {disfmarker} Yes .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Now um did you make any use of that ? See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed .\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Do you {disfmarker}\nPhD D: The {disfmarker} the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to use to {disfmarker} to nnn , {vocalsound} eh to put {disfmarker} i i it 's a reference for me . But eh the transcription {disfmarker} eh for example , I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not interested in the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in {disfmarker} eh follow in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the {disfmarker} in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker , in the {disfmarker} in the meeting , um eh she {disfmarker} she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh {disfmarker} there is an overlapping zone . But eh there isn't any {disfmarker} any mark , time {disfmarker} temporal mark , to {disfmarker} to c eh {disfmarker} to mmm {vocalsound} {disfmarker} e - heh , to label {comment} the beginning and the end of the {disfmarker} of the\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm . OK . Right , so she is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: ta I 'm {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think eh we need this information to\nProfessor E: Right . So the twelve {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} it took you twelve hours {disfmarker} of course this included maybe some {disfmarker} some time where you were learning about what {disfmarker} what you wanted to do , but {disfmarker} but uh , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your\nGrad G: Twelve minutes .\nPhD D: Twelve minutes .\nProfessor E: s Twelve minutes !\nPhD D: Twelve minutes . Twelve .\nProfessor E: I thought you did forty - five minutes of {disfmarker}\nPhD D: No , forty - five minutes is the {disfmarker} is the session , all the session .\nPostdoc B: Oh .\nProfessor E: Oh , you haven't done the whole session .\nPhD D: Yeah , all is the {vocalsound} the session .\nProfessor E: This is just twelve minutes .\nPhD D: Tw - twelve hours of work to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part {disfmarker} of f\nProfessor E: Oh . So {comment} let me back up again . So the {disfmarker} when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: that 's in twelve minutes ?\nPhD D: No no no . I {disfmarker} I consider all the {disfmarker} all the session because eh I {disfmarker} I count the nnn {disfmarker} the nnn {disfmarker} the overlappings marked by {disfmarker} by Jane ,\nProfessor E: Oh , OK .\nPostdoc B: Oh , I see .\nPhD D: in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the {pause} fin in {disfmarker} in the {pause} forty - five minutes .\nProfessor E: OK . So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes , but you have {disfmarker} you have time uh , uh marked {disfmarker} twelve minute {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Got it .\nPhD F: So , can I ask {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can I ask whether you found {disfmarker} uh , you know , how accurate uh Jane 's uh uh labels were as far as {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Well , not just the overlaps , everything .\nPhD F: you know , did she miss some overlaps ? or did she n ?\nPhD D: But , by {disfmarker} by the moment , I {disfmarker} I don't compare , my {disfmarker} my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I {disfmarker} I want to do it . Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the {disfmarker} in the marks , I {disfmarker} and if I {disfmarker} I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can correct and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: Well , also Jane {disfmarker} Jane was doing word level .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: So we weren't concerned with {comment} exactly when an overlap started and stopped .\nPhD F: Right . Right .\nPhD C: Well , not only a word level , but actually\nPhD D: Well {disfmarker}\nPhD F: I 'm expect I 'm not expecting {disfmarker}\nPhD D: No , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I mean , you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption , you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPostdoc B: Well {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Well , yeah , b yeah , I would say time bin . So my {disfmarker} my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , {pause} beginning and end point .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: And {disfmarker} and sometimes , you know , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: but , yeah , w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that {disfmarker} i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken , it would have {disfmarker} it would have been hard with the interface that we have .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Now , my {disfmarker} a Adam 's working on a of course , on a revised overlapping interface ,\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD D: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} it 's a good eh work ,\nPostdoc B: but {disfmarker}\nPhD D: but eh I think we need eh eh more information .\nPhD F: No , of course .\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD F: I expect you to find more overlaps than {disfmarker} than Jane\nGrad G: Always need more for {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD D: No , no . I {disfmarker} I have to go to {disfmarker}\nPhD F: because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level .\nPhD D: I want eh {disfmarker} I wanted to eh compare the {disfmarker} the transcription .\nProfessor E: I have {disfmarker}\nGrad G: But if it takes sixty to one {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Well , I but I have a suggestion about that . Um , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting , but in the interests of making progress , uh might I s how {disfmarker} how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ?\nPhD D: Only .\nProfessor E: Yes .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Do not mark any other events ,\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: but only mark speaker {disfmarker} Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ?\nPhD D: OK . OK . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I w I {disfmarker} I wanted to {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Do y do you think that would speed it up ? Uh , speed up your {disfmarker} your {disfmarker} your marking ?\nPhD D: nnn , I don't understand very .\nProfessor E: It took you a long time {pause} to mark twelve minutes .\nPhD D: Yeah . Oh , yeah , yeah .\nProfessor E: Now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three {disfmarker}\nPhD D: On - only to mark {disfmarker} only to mark overlapping zone , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ?\nPhD D: Oh , yeah . Sure .\nProfessor E: Yeah OK .\nPhD D: Yeah sure .\nProfessor E: Then I think it 's a good idea .\nPhD D: Sure sure .\nProfessor E: Then I think it 's a good idea , because it\nPhD D: Sure , because I {disfmarker} I need a lot of time to {disfmarker} to put the label or to do that . Yeah .\nProfessor E: Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise .\nGrad G: And\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor E: There 's {disfmarker} there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth , and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: and {disfmarker} and something in between with paper rustling . We know that all that 's there and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study , but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: Whereas th i I would think that uh you {disfmarker} we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking .\nPhD D: Uh - huh . OK . OK .\nProfessor E: So . Then you can get the {disfmarker} Cuz you need {disfmarker} If it 's three hundred uh {disfmarker} i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah .\nProfessor E: And {disfmarker} and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of {disfmarker} of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics .\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD C: Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Well , that 's {disfmarker} That 's what I was gonna bring up .\nPhD C: I mean , you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand ,\nProfessor E: Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation .\nPhD C: right ? I 'm sorry .\nProfessor E: So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as {disfmarker} I mean there 's a bunch of things {disfmarker} I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . In the far - field mike .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: Oh , OK .\nProfessor E: Um , and uh , it 's not obvious , I mean , you could {disfmarker} you could do the dumbest thing and get {disfmarker} get it ninety percent of the time . But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the {disfmarker} you know , the right detector . So the idea is to have some ground truth first . And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say \" OK this , i you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really here \" .\nPhD A: But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ?\nPhD C: What I mean is {pause} get it from the close - talking mikes .\nProfessor E: Uh , yeah .\nPhD C: A or ge get a first pass from those ,\nProfessor E: We t we t w we t we talked about that .\nPhD C: and then go through sort of {disfmarker} It 'd be a lot faster probably to {disfmarker}\nPhD F: And you can {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , that 's his , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we talked about that . s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is ,\nPhD C: Yeah , I just {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway , and {disfmarker} and then whatever he could mark would be helpful ,\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor E: and we could {disfmarker} Uh it 's a question of what you bootstrap from . You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then {disfmarker} then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike . I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time .\nPhD C: Well , that 's what I wonder , because um {disfmarker} or how bad it is ,\nProfessor E: Well\nPhD C: be um , because that would be interesting\nGrad G: I 'm working on a program to do that , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . Right ? I mean , we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for . We have the audio data , we have the close - talking mike ,\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: so I mean it seems like one kind of project that 's not perfect , but {disfmarker} um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech ,\nProfessor E: Right , we discussed that .\nPhD C: you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ?\nGrad G: And {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Oh .\nGrad G: I 've {disfmarker} I 've written a program to do that ,\nPhD C: OK , I 'm sorry I missed the {disfmarker}\nGrad G: and it , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: It 's OK .\nGrad G: and {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} but it 's {disfmarker} it 's doing something very , very simple . It just takes a threshold , based on {disfmarker} on the volume ,\nPhD C: Uh - huh .\nPhD F: Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand .\nPhD C: Right , by hand . Yeah .\nPhD F: Yeah .\nGrad G: um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs . And , it seems to work , I 've {disfmarker} I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something , and I haven't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} what I 'm working on {disfmarker} was working on {disfmarker} was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , {pause} into Transcriber . And so {disfmarker} I told {disfmarker} I said it would take about a day . I 've worked on it for about half a day ,\nGrad H: I have to go .\nGrad G: so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with .\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor E: See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working , because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided ,\nPhD C: Right . I 'm sorry . I just {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: but I couldn't remember all of it .\nPhD C: It\nProfessor E: So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when {disfmarker} when he {disfmarker} he gets his thing going ,\nGrad G: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: uh , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: That was {disfmarker} that was exactly the notion that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that we discussed .\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad G: Thanks .\nPostdoc B: Another thing we discussed was um that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: It looks good .\nProfessor E: So .\nPhD C: I 'll be in touch . Thanks .\nProfessor E: S See ya . Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Was that um there m {pause} there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written , {comment} that uh handle bleedthrough , I mean cuz you have this {disfmarker} this close {disfmarker} you have contamination from other people who speak loudly .\nGrad G: Yeah , and I haven't tried using that . It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that . It 's a cross - correlation filter . So I {disfmarker} I haven't tried that , but that {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it might be something {disfmarker} it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little .\nPostdoc B: So , some thought of maybe having {disfmarker} Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours .\nGrad G: Exactly . Yep .\nProfessor E: But {disfmarker} but that 's a refinement\nPostdoc B: That 's what we were discussing .\nProfessor E: and I think we wanna see {disfmarker} try the simple thing first , cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first .\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: But uh , having {disfmarker} having somebody have some experience , again , with {disfmarker} with uh {disfmarker} with marking it from a human standpoint , we 're {disfmarker} I mean , I don't expect Jose to {disfmarker} to do it for uh f fifty hours of {disfmarker} {comment} of speech , but I mean we {disfmarker} {comment} if uh {disfmarker} if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it .\nPhD D: Yeah . Sure . Sure .\nProfessor E: And when {disfmarker} when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different .\nPhD C: Oh yeah , definitely .\nPhD A: You know , I did {disfmarker} I did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty well . I mean , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs . And uh , you know , you can {disfmarker}\nGrad G: It seemed like the right thing to do .\nPhD A: Yeah . I mean , you {disfmarker} you can get y I mean , you get them pretty close .\nGrad G: That was with zero literature search .\nPhD A: And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to {disfmarker} to do it .\nGrad G: That 's good validation .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Is this proprietary ?\nPhD A: Uh . {comment} No . No .\nGrad G: Yeah , do you have a patent on it ?\nPhD A: It was when I was working for the government .\nProfessor E: Oh , then everybody owns it . It 's the people .\nPostdoc B: Well , I mean , is this something that we could just co - opt , or is it {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Nah .\nPostdoc B: No . OK .\nProfessor E: Well , i i i he 's pretty close , anyway . I think {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , he 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it doesn't take a long time .\nPostdoc B: Right . I just thought if it was tried and true , then {disfmarker} {comment} and he 's gone through additional levels of {disfmarker} of development .\nGrad G: Just output . Although if you {disfmarker} if you have some parameters like what 's a good window size for the median filter {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh ! {comment} I have to remember . I 'll think about it , and try to remember .\nPhD F: And it might be different for government people .\nGrad G: That 's alright .\nProfessor E: Yeah , good enough for government work , as they say .\nPhD C: They {disfmarker} they {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Di - dif different {disfmarker} different bandwidth .\nPhD F: They\nGrad G: I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , {comment} sorts of numbers .\nPhD F: OK .\nProfessor E: Uh , I don't know , it {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we want to uh {disfmarker} So , uh , maybe we should move on to other {disfmarker} other things in limited time .\nPostdoc B: Can I ask one question about his statistics ? So {disfmarker} so in the tw twelve minutes , um , if we took three hundred and divided it by four , which is about the length of twelve minutes , i Um , I 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: Did you find uh more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD D: More than ?\nPostdoc B: More than {disfmarker} How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ?\nPhD D: How many ? Eh , not @ @ I Onl - only I {disfmarker} I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD D: but eh I {disfmarker} I don't co eh {disfmarker} I don't count eh the {disfmarker} the overlap .\nPostdoc B: The overlaps . OK .\nPhD D: I consider I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} the nnn {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} the three hundred is eh considered only you {disfmarker} your transcription . I have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to finish transcribing . So .\nGrad G: I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than {disfmarker} than sort of the middle .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Middle or end .\nPostdoc B: I 'm not sure .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Because i we 're {disfmarker} we 're dealing with the {disfmarker} Uh , in the early meetings , we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , {comment} and things like that ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: and that seems to be a lot of overlap .\nPostdoc B: I think it 's an empirical question .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: I think we could find that out .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPostdoc B: I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not sure that the beginning had more .\nProfessor E: So {disfmarker} so I was gonna ask , I guess about any {disfmarker} any other things that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that either of you wanted to talk about , especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes , that {disfmarker} that you wanna go with .\nPhD C: Can I just ask about the data , like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data , just cuz I 'm {disfmarker} I wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what {disfmarker} what can be done first and like how many meetings are we recording\nProfessor E: Right so there 's this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point . Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM . Right ? And then we don't know .\nPhD C: How many meetings is that ? Like {disfmarker} how many {disfmarker}\nGrad G: What 's that ?\nProfessor E: That was about ten hours , and there was about {disfmarker}\nPhD C: t ten {disfmarker} It 's like ten meetings or something ? Uh - huh .\nGrad G: Yeah , something like that . And then {disfmarker} then we\nPhD A: Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the {pause} missing files .\nProfessor E: Oh . Oh , that 's right , that had {disfmarker} those have not been sent .\nPhD A: H how many total have we recorded now , altogether ?\nProfessor E: We 're saying about {pause} twelve hours .\nGrad G: About twelve {pause} by now . Twelve or thirteen .\nPhD C: Uh - huh . And we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously we 're only recording this one now ? or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor E: No . No , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the biggest one {disfmarker} uh , chunk so far ,\nGrad G: Nope .\nPhD A: It was the morning one .\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor E: but there 's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys .\nGrad G: Jerry .\nPhD C: Do they meet every week ,\nProfessor E: And then there {disfmarker}\nPhD C: or every {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Uh , they do . w w And we talked to them about recording some more and we 're going to , uh , we 've started having a morning meeting , today uh i starting a w a week or two ago , on the uh front - end issues , and we 're recording those , uh there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded ,\nPhD C: Great .\nProfessor E: and we 're gonna start recording them . They 're {disfmarker} They meet on Tuesdays . We 're gonna start recording them next week . So actually , we 're gonna h start having a {disfmarker} a pretty significant chunk and so , you know , {vocalsound} Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff {disfmarker} things like that , now that uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the things are starting to happen . So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings , but there are scattered other meetings in it and that {disfmarker} that amount is gonna grow uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately {disfmarker} i if we 're {disfmarker} if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it , not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not eighty or ninety . But .\nPhD C: So there 's probably {disfmarker} there 's three to four a week ,\nGrad G: That 's what we 're aiming for .\nPhD C: that we 're aiming for .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And they 're each about an hour or something .\nProfessor E: Yeah , yeah .\nGrad G: Although {disfmarker} Yeah . We 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker} OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah and th the {disfmarker} the other thing is I 'm not pos I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really don't know {disfmarker} maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty , but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: Because it 's just an added bunch of weird stuff .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: And , you know , we {disfmarker} we h we 're highly motivated . Uh in fact , the morning group is really motivated cuz they 're working on connected digits , so it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Actually that 's something I wanted to ask , is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those .\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nGrad G: And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance . But I haven't been ru I haven't been doing that . Um , if I did that , is someone gonna be working on it ?\nProfessor E: Uh , yeah , I {disfmarker} I think definitely s so Absolutely .\nGrad G: I mean , is it something of interest ?\nProfessor E: Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that .\nGrad G: OK . I mean , I I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm interested in it , I just don't have time to do it now .\nPhD F: I was {disfmarker} these meetings {disfmarker} I 'm sure someone thought of this , but these {disfmarker} this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation .\nGrad G: So\nPhD F: Um .\nGrad G: Yep . Yep .\nPhD C: Actually I have o\nGrad G: I {disfmarker} I would really like someone to do adaptation .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder .\nProfessor E: Well {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things I wanted to do , uh , that I I talked to {disfmarker} to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation ,\nGrad G: Since it 's the same people over and over .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: to try to get rid of some of the effects of the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the far - field effects . Um , I mean we have {disfmarker} the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: because people move around , and uh , if {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's uh not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} you can't really do inversion ,\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something {disfmarker} It may {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we 've taken is more \" lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal \" .\nPhD F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Uh , that 's the party line . But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous . It 's good {disfmarker} {vocalsound} good to sort of test them , actually . And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do . So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation . Um , there was a {disfmarker} have been some nice talks recently by {disfmarker} by Lucent on {disfmarker} on their b\nPhD F: Hmm .\nProfessor E: the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me , uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . {comment} And um , you know , th\nPhD A: W what is the um {disfmarker} the artifact you try to {disfmarker} you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?\nPhD F: Ciao .\nProfessor E: Uh so it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} you have a {disfmarker} a direct uh {disfmarker} Uh , what 's the difference in {disfmarker} If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um {disfmarker}\nPhD F: I 'm signing off .\nProfessor E: Yeah . that would subtract off {comment} the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so {disfmarker} so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation {disfmarker} Yeah , so you {disfmarker} Given that um {disfmarker} Yeah , so you 're trying to {disfmarker} So you 'd {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself {disfmarker} adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract {disfmarker} essentially to subtract off uh different uh {disfmarker} different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had {disfmarker} you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a {disfmarker} there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .\nPhD A: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would {disfmarker} you might hear kind of an echo ? And {disfmarker} and then this {disfmarker} noise cancellation would get\nProfessor E: Well , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm saying {disfmarker} That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . {comment} What 's really happening is {disfmarker} Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you {disfmarker} To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the {disfmarker} the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the {disfmarker} the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to use this uh {disfmarker} this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this {disfmarker} this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh {disfmarker} gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to {disfmarker} you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um {disfmarker} uh with some constraints .\nPhD A: Kind of a clean up thing , that {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: It 's a clean up thing . Right .\nPhD A: OK .\nProfessor E: So , echo cancelling is {disfmarker} is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you {disfmarker} if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .\nPhD A: When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um {disfmarker} some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh {disfmarker} And then it would come on and it was very clear ,\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD A: you know .\nProfessor E: Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try {disfmarker} somebody look {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data {disfmarker} plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh . {vocalsound} Um\nPostdoc B: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?\nProfessor E: Brian 's {comment} Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know {disfmarker} There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right {disfmarker} the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those {disfmarker} those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right {disfmarker} you know , right {disfmarker} right uh {disfmarker} delays are {disfmarker} is , uh {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} right delayed signal is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a {disfmarker} in a situation that 's very reverberant {disfmarker} {comment} with long reverberation times {comment} and really long delays , it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a {disfmarker} a c a complete inversion , if you actually {disfmarker} I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the {disfmarker} the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you {disfmarker} you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and {disfmarker} and uh goes to infinity . So it 's {disfmarker} so there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents {disfmarker} I mean there 's all sorts of {disfmarker} all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking {disfmarker} uh , just picking uh features , which were {disfmarker} uh will give you more {disfmarker} something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was {disfmarker} I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you {disfmarker} you actually already said this thing about the uh {disfmarker} about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to {disfmarker} So this was the human subjects folks who said this , {comment} or that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} ?\nPostdoc B: The a apparently {disfmarker} I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it {pause} that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .\nProfessor E: OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that {disfmarker} that we have . We have {disfmarker} we have an hour uh that {disfmarker} that is transcribed , we have {disfmarker} we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we {disfmarker} if this really uh {disfmarker} Well , do we have that much ?\nPhD C: Not really . It 's three to four per week .\nProfessor E: Let 's see , we have {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So that 's what {disfmarker} You know , that {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: uh eight weeks , uh is {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So that 's not a lot of hours .\nProfessor E: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's {disfmarker} Yeah , so like thirty {disfmarker} thirty hours ?\nPhD A: Three {disfmarker} Three hours .\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean , is there {disfmarker} I know this sounds {pause} tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this {vocalsound} but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,\nProfessor E: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .\nPhD C: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .\nPhD C: I mean , is there {disfmarker} Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them {comment} or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong {disfmarker}\nGrad G: We had some good ones earlier .\nPhD C: There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I think it 's hard to record those .\nPhD C: To be allowed to record them ?\nPostdoc B: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor E: Yeah , people will get {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: But I {disfmarker} but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .\nPhD C: OK . Well , if there is , anyway .\nProfessor E: Yeah , I was gonna mention that .\nGrad G: Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's {disfmarker} That would be a good match .\nProfessor E: Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . So I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh , I {disfmarker} I 'd mentioned to Adam , and {disfmarker} that was another thing I was gonna talk {disfmarker} uh , mention to them before {disfmarker} {comment} that uh there 's uh {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , {comment} that {disfmarker} that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and so it doesn't really give us the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show , {pause} or this {disfmarker} you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? \" And uh they may be willing to record it uh with {disfmarker}\nPhD C: With lapel mikes or something ?\nProfessor E: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it {disfmarker} it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor E: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they start recording , isn't {disfmarker} als also is not going to be this exact setup .\nPhD C: Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data .\nProfessor E: So , {comment} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , {comment} uh that we could invite them to have like some of their {disfmarker} {comment} record some of their shows here .\nPostdoc B: Wow !\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} Or {disfmarker} The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,\nGrad G: Right , as we are .\nPhD C: right ? So . {comment} Um , I think that 'd be fantastic\nProfessor E: Right .\nPhD C: cuz those kinds of panels and {disfmarker} Those have interesting\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: Th - that 's an {disfmarker} a side of style {disfmarker} a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great .\nProfessor E: And {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} I mean , the other side to it was the {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} which is where we were coming from {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you more about it later {comment} is that {disfmarker} is that there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and {disfmarker} and permissions and all that . I mean , they already do what they do {disfmarker} do whatever they do . So it 's {disfmarker} uh , it 's {disfmarker} So it 's {disfmarker} so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um {disfmarker} and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could {disfmarker} @ @ in the {disfmarker} under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Right . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , \" OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . And you {disfmarker} you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your {disfmarker} your data for awhile so um right now {disfmarker} and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right ? Do {disfmarker} Oh , do we now ?\nProfessor E: Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So um , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: and they 're pretty different , because\nProfessor E: Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you {disfmarker} you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like ,\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD C: um {disfmarker} Right . Right , right .\nProfessor E: and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can {disfmarker} you can do a lot of other things .\nPhD C: Cuz I 'm not actually sure , just logistically that I can spend {disfmarker} you know , I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time . And that 's {disfmarker} and especially with the student\nGrad G: Right .\nPhD C: uh for instance this guy who seems {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh anyway , I shouldn't say too much , but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person . And so it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now {disfmarker} Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh {disfmarker} which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .\nPhD C: And we just don't know about the transcription part of that ,\nProfessor E: So that 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: Yeah , we need to {disfmarker} I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards ,\nPhD C: so . I mean , it {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions .\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: So I think that we 'll need to adjust some {disfmarker} And also if we wanna add things like um , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through . I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection . There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh , you know , friends , and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to , right ?\nProfessor E: If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @ {disfmarker} I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions , but I think if it 's a real {disfmarker} Why not ? Yeah .\nPhD C: I mean , I 'm thinking , politically {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Stage some political debates .\nPostdoc B: You could do this ,\nPhD C: Well yeah ,\nPostdoc B: you know . You could .\nPhD C: or just if you 're {disfmarker} if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't {pause} um have them do the digits , {comment} or maybe have them do a shorter {pause} digit thing {comment} like if it was , you know , uh , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do .\nGrad G: We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to .\nPhD C: Then , having the data is very valuable , cuz I think it 's um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the ITR , if we put in a proposal on it . It 'll just look like ICSI 's collected a lot more audio data . Um , whether it 's transcribed or not um , is another issue , but there 's {disfmarker} there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer .\nPostdoc B: It seems like you could hold some meetings .\nGrad G: Yep .\nPostdoc B: You know , you and maybe Adam ?\nPhD C: So .\nPostdoc B: You {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} you could maybe hold some additional meetings , if you wanted .\nPhD A: Would it help at all {disfmarker} I mean , we 're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings . One is uh um without doing the digits {disfmarker} Or , I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits , what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff .\nPhD C: Need the close - talking mikes .\nPhD A: You do , OK .\nPhD C: I mean , absolutely ,\nProfessor E: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: yeah . I 'm really scared {disfmarker}\nGrad G: It seems like it 's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes .\nPhD A: I see , OK .\nPhD C: Um or at least , like , me personally ? I would {disfmarker} {comment} I {disfmarker} couldn't use that data .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPostdoc B: I agree . And Mari also ,\nPhD C: Um .\nPostdoc B: we had {disfmarker} This came up when she she was here . That 's important .\nPhD C: So it 's a great idea ,\nProfessor E: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} b By the {disfmarker} by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck .\nPhD C: and if it were true than I would just do that , but it 's not that bad {disfmarker} like the room is not the bottleneck , and we have enough time in the room , it 's getting the people to come in and put on the {disfmarker} and get the setup going .\nProfessor E: I think the issue is just that we 're {disfmarker} we 're blazing that path . Right ? And {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} d Do you have any idea when {disfmarker} when uh the {disfmarker} you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ?\nGrad G: Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad G: So it 'll be early next week .\nProfessor E: Yeah , OK . So early next week we send it to them , and then {disfmarker} then we check with them to see if they 've got it and we {disfmarker} we start , you know asking about the timing for it .\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on .\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: Right ?\nGrad G: Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , who knows where they are .\nPhD A: Have they ever responded to you ?\nGrad G: Nope .\nProfessor E: Yeah , but {disfmarker} You know , so they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they have {disfmarker} you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do ,\nPhD C: What if {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , you {disfmarker} we can't complain .\nProfessor E: right ? But they {disfmarker} But at any rate , they 'll {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think once they get that sorted out , they 're {disfmarker} they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they {disfmarker} who 's {disfmarker} who is doing it , and uh I think it 's not going to be {disfmarker} I don't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour , I think . It 's not going to be thirty\nGrad G: Yep . I think that 's probably true .\nPhD C: Really ? So it 's the amount of {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: It 's {disfmarker} it 's just getting it going .\nGrad G: It 's pipeline , pipeline issues .\nPhD C: Right . What about these lunch meetings {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Once the pipeline fills .\nPhD C: I mean , I don't know , if there 's any way without too much more overhead , even if we don't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile , {comment} to record you know , two or three more meeting a week , just to have the data , even if they 're um not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ?\nProfessor E: But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No , I meant , um , sorry , the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs , maybe they don't wanna be recorded , but {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Oh , and we 're just chatting ?\nPhD C: Just the ch the chatting .\nGrad G: Yeah , we have a lot of those .\nPhD C: I actually {disfmarker} I actually think that 's {pause} useful {pause} data , um {pause} the chatting ,\nGrad G: Yeah , the problem with that is I would {disfmarker} I think I would feel a little constrained to {disfmarker} You know ? Uh , some of the meetings {disfmarker}\nPhD C: but {disfmarker} OK . You don't wanna do it , cuz {disfmarker} OK .\nGrad G: You know , our \" soccer ball \" meeting ?\nPhD C: Alright .\nGrad G: I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting .\nPhD C: Alright , {comment} so I 'll just throw it out there , if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI , um that we could record , I think it would be worth it .\nGrad G: That was hilarious .\nProfessor E: Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they {disfmarker} because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . So then that would double {pause} what we had . Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW uh {disfmarker} I mean really m a lot more {comment} than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor E: so .\nPhD A: Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ?\nProfessor E: Uh , {vocalsound} they seem to have some problems with it . We can {disfmarker} we can talk about that later . Um , but , again , Jerry is {disfmarker} Jerry 's open {disfmarker} So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh Jerry was open to it but I {disfmarker} I s One of the things that I think is a little {disfmarker} a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week . You know ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that people are gonna feel uh {disfmarker} are gonna feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . And the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} so then they can just really sort of try to {disfmarker} put the mikes on and then just charge in and {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yep .\nPhD C: What if we give people {disfmarker} you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?\nPostdoc B: Well , you know , I {disfmarker} I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .\nPhD C: OK .\nPostdoc B: But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,\nPhD C: Alright , alright , alright .\nPostdoc B: but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial . I mean , we could {disfmarker} political discussions , or {disfmarker} or something or other ,\nPhD C: No , definitely .\nPostdoc B: and i you know , people who are {disfmarker} Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh goldibears {disfmarker} goldi goldilocks , it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . And um {disfmarker} a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word .\nPhD A: Well , even {disfmarker} I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about\nPostdoc B: We could pay subjects .\nPhD A: or what about people in the {disfmarker} in the building ?\nPhD C: Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo\nPhD A: I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad G: I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .\nPostdoc B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Oh .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: So I {disfmarker} I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition\nPhD C: Alright , well .\nGrad G: and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \" , but then I got email from them that said \" no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . \" So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .\nPhD A: What about Joachim , maybe he can {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: But {disfmarker} but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . And I {disfmarker} I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the {disfmarker} with the radio .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .\nPhD C: Well , and they 're already {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} these things are already recorded ,\nGrad G: Yep .\nProfessor E: Yeah .\nPhD C: we don't have to ask them to {disfmarker} even {disfmarker} and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: n Well {disfmarker} No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones\nPhD C: Why {disfmarker} why not ?\nProfessor E: because {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} because we would be asking them to do something different .\nPhD C: Well , we can find out . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in {disfmarker} in LDC getting {pause} data , uh , and {disfmarker}\nProfessor E: Right , that 's the found data idea .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor E: But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E: And u I think routinely they would not do this . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere\nPhD C: Right . Great . OK .  \nProfessor E: and uh {disfmarker} But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I might be able to talk them into it .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad G: Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here .\nPhD C: That 's a good way to end a meeting .\nProfessor E: OK . Well I don't {disfmarker} why don't we {disfmarker} why d u why don't we uh uh turn them {disfmarker} turn\nGrad G: OK , leave {disfmarker} leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time .\nPostdoc B: Oh . That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: Turning off the microphone made it crash . Well {disfmarker}\nPostdoc B: That 's good to know .\nProfessor E: OK .", "answers": ["Efforts by speaker mn005 are in progress to detect overlapping speech. For a single transcribed meeting, speaker mn005 reported approximately 300 cases of overlap. Future work will involve manually deriving time marks from sections of overlapping speech for the same meeting, and then experimenting with different measures, e.g. energy increase, to determine a set of acoustically salient features for identifying speaker overlap.

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad F: Test .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: Let 's see , I should be Two .\nPhD D: Up high {disfmarker}\nGrad E: As close to your mouth as you can get it .\nProfessor B: La\nPhD D: high as you can get .\nProfessor B: Is this channel one ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah , on your upper lip .\nPhD H: Channel one one one .\nProfessor B: Gee , OK . Yes . OK .\nGrad E: OK , so for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} For people wearing the wireless mikes , like {disfmarker} like this one , I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this {disfmarker} this sorta like that .\nPhD H: This is {disfmarker} chan channel channel one one two three\nGrad F: Channel five , channel five .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Mm - hmm . What do you do ,\nGrad E: It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples ,\nGrad F: Test , test test .\nProfessor B: you do it higher ?\nGrad E: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , I think we 're supposed to {disfmarker} that 's right .\nGrad E: And then also , for {disfmarker} for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth ,\nGrad F: Test test .\nPhD A: By the way , there was a bug . Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper\nPhD D: Oh it was .\nGrad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth ,\nPhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: so about like I 'm wearing it now .\nPhD D: Oh that 's interesting . So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nGrad E: so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth ,\nPhD H: It 's not always possible .\nPhD A: Hmm ?\nPhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nPostdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: Is that @ @ ? OK , thank you .\nGrad F: Adam , I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD D: O Oh oh I see .\nGrad F: uh , looks kinda low on channel five {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I see , I see .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad F: no ?\nGrad E: Channel five , s speak again .\nGrad F: Maybe not .\nPostdoc G: Hello .\nPhD A: Basically there were no counts\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's alright .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad E: I mean , we could {disfmarker} we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to .\nGrad F: It 's OK ?\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad F: Is this OK ?\nPhD H: OK .\nPhD D: I see what you mean .\nPhD C: Who 's channel B ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker} Uh , channel B is probably Liz .\nPhD C: Uh oh .\nPhD H: Uh channel B {disfmarker} I am channel B .\nProfessor B: You wanna close this ,\nPostdoc G: Channel eight , eight .\nProfessor B: or\nPhD C: No I\nGrad E: Thank you .\nPhD H: No , channel B .\nPhD A: Hello , hello .\nPhD C: yeah , yeah , you 're channel B .\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah .\nPhD C: So can you talk a bit ? I thought it might be too\nPhD H: OK , yeah , channel B , one two three four five .\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's alright . So , the gain isn't real good .\nProfessor B: We 're recording ,\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor B: right ?\nGrad E: OK , so we are recording .\nPhD H: Ah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: Um we {disfmarker} we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it . And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .\nPhD H: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: We {disfmarker} we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank . Um I {disfmarker} I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: so\nPhD D: California .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: California .\nPhD H: California .\nPhD A: Um may I make one suggestion ? Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth\nGrad E: Sure .\nPhD A: because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .\nGrad E: Oh .\nPhD C: A actually , wait a minute ,\nGrad E: Birth year ?\nPostdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around ?\nPhD D: Not for me .\nPostdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the other side ,\nPhD A: Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: O yeah .\nPhD D: But there 's no other date on the form .\nPhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nPostdoc G: Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .\nGrad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .\nPhD A: Anyway .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , that 's true .\nPhD C: I still don't see the problem .\nGrad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is alright\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: so , anyway . And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time , the speaker form only once , the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting . OK ? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form . And that should just be one person whose name I don't know . OK ?\nGrad F: Do you want this {pause} Adam ?\nGrad E: Uh sure . Thank you .\nProfessor B: So uh\nGrad E: OK so should we do agenda items ?\nProfessor B: Uh oh that 's a good idea . I shouldn't run the meeting .\nGrad E: Uh well I have {disfmarker} I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results . Anything else ?\nPhD C: I guess {disfmarker} what time do we have to leave ? Three thirty ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nGrad E: Why don't you go first then .\nPhD C: so .\nProfessor B: Yeah , good idea .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Um Well , I {disfmarker} I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams {disfmarker} a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who {disfmarker} Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um {vocalsound} you know separated {disfmarker} used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so {disfmarker} so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that {disfmarker} that 's twenty minutes or so ? Um yeah because I guess there 's some ,\nGrad E: Or so .\nPhD C: and Don can talk to Jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm {disfmarker} we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} was that {disfmarker} did that {disfmarker} did that recording have the glitch in the middle ?\nPostdoc G: I 'm puzzled by that . I {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} oh , I see .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Oh there was a glitch somewhere .\nPhD C: yeah , so that actually um\nGrad F: Was it twenty minutes in ,\nPhD C: if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know\nPostdoc G: I forgot about that .\nGrad F: I thought {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well it was interesting ,\nPostdoc G: Well , I mean , they {disfmarker}\nPhD A: suddenly {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent\nGrad E: I don't remember when it is .\nPostdoc G: but I was able to can transcribe\nPhD A: but i looking at {disfmarker} the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the {disfmarker} it was actually recognized\nPhD C: Wel\nGrad E: Oh no .\nGrad F: Yeah , that might be {disfmarker} that might be {disfmarker} that might be my fault .\nPostdoc G: Wow .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .\nGrad F: I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: No actually it was {disfmarker} yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um\nGrad F: yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time ,\nPostdoc G: Oh . That 's not good .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: so that 's what we have\nGrad E: Alright .\nGrad F: so\nPhD C: but that {disfmarker} that will be completely gone if this synch time problem\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: The {disfmarker} the glitch\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to\nPostdoc G: And the only glitch {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: yeah .\nPhD C: So you guys know .\nProfessor B: S sorry I haven't seen the email ,\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Th - the\nPostdoc G: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} wait\nProfessor B: what was the score ?\nPhD C: So here 's the actual copy of the email\nPostdoc G: we should say something about the glitch . He {disfmarker} he can say something about the glitch .\nPhD C: um oh OK\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Cuz it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} h it 's {disfmarker} it 's very small {disfmarker}\nPhD C: so does this glitch occur at other {disfmarker}\nGrad E: There {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized\nPostdoc G: very small . Yep .\nPhD C: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad E: so the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad E: and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing {disfmarker} doing click sounds .\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And is it only once that that happens ?\nGrad E: But yeah\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: it {disfmarker} right once in the middle .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong\nProfessor B: so {disfmarker} so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice ,\nPhD C: but\nGrad E: Um But that shouldn't affect anything\nPhD C: OK so that 's actually\nPostdoc G: S and it {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: you see this here ?\nPhD C: It {disfmarker} y it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah yeah \" bah \"\nPhD C: OK no {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: What happens is it actually affects the script that Don {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Huh .\nPhD C: I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it\nGrad E: Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything .\nPhD C: but they\nGrad F: Yeah , I don't know exactly what affected it\nPostdoc G: I agree . I agree .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I have {disfmarker}\nGrad F: but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you about it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: But I {disfmarker} I do remember {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: I 'll show you the point .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . It {disfmarker} it had no effect on my transcription ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: you know , I mean I {disfmarker} I had no trouble hearing it and {disfmarker} and having time bins\nGrad E: I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .\nPostdoc G: but there was a {disfmarker} Oh .\nPhD C: Well , the {disfmarker} the synch time {disfmarker} the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should ,\nGrad F: That 's what happened .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad E: Where {disfmarker} where they weren't monotonic .\nGrad F: There was {disfmarker} yeah , I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: right ? There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh , interesting .\nPhD C: And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right\nGrad E: Oh OK so that 's\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: so anyway it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah sounds like a bug .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Non - zero ? Um there are like more {disfmarker} cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran ,\nGrad E: The other one I saw was that it yeah .\nGrad F: I mean but there were there was a point .\nPhD C: Yeah that was fine . That {disfmarker} that was OK .\nGrad E: The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: and that definitely indicra indicates a bug .\nGrad F: Uh .\nPhD C: Well that would really be a problem , yeah . So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: um and what 's {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So that 's very encouraging .\nPhD C: this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Cool .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which\nPhD D: Trent Lott .\nPhD C: um I mean these are sort of funny ones ,\nPhD D: It 'll get those though .\nPhD C: there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see\nGrad E: I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: but um it 's pretty good .\nGrad E: because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ?\nPhD C: Well so I guess we can generate\nGrad E: Sounds likes ?\nPhD A: There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where {disfmarker} got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Yeah , and who cares ? And {disfmarker} and there were lots of {disfmarker} of course the \" uh uh \" - s , \" in on \" - s \" of uh \" - s .\nPhD A: Mmm , so if {disfmarker}\nPhD C: there 's {disfmarker} No those are actually\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or\nGrad E: Right . Ri - ri right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Did you say there 's no language for PZM ?\nPhD C: No language model , I mean those {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean {disfmarker} so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings .\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet .\nProfessor B: Well , we don't even know what that means ,\nPhD C: so {vocalsound} but this is really encouraging because\nProfessor B: so I\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right .\nPhD C: so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of {disfmarker} of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained {disfmarker} mostly trained recognizer\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and Switchboard - two is {disfmarker} got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic\nGrad E: Excellent .\nPhD C: and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did {disfmarker} had the ninety - three workshop\nPhD C: Um\nProfessor B: and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Oh yeah\nProfessor B: you know\nPhD C: I mean this is really ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: Well especially for the very first run , I mean you {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh it 's the {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: eh um\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: yeah\nGrad E: the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but\nPhD C: So and what al also this means is that\nPostdoc G: Right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Not Switchboard ,\nPhD A: Well it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people\nGrad E: uh Broadcast News .\nPhD C: especially I guess um with Jane that {disfmarker} that would help for {disfmarker} since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring . I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so you know the language model was straight from {disfmarker} from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or {disfmarker} or\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nGrad E: Yeah , so that 's great .\nPhD C: No .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: And actually {disfmarker} we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nPhD A: Well that 's {disfmarker} those are the only we ones there are ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: which I guess\nPhD D: I was just gonna say ,\nPhD C: so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of\nPhD D: yeah .\nPhD A: I mean\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: and I guess Ramana , so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: it 's {disfmarker} it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech .\nPhD D: It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech\nPhD C: So .\nPhD A: Oh yeah .\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah ,\nPhD C: Right , so it 's {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: but for Broadcast News when we {disfmarker} we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss .\nGrad E: Right , it was not a big deal .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: I should {disfmarker} I should say that {disfmarker} the language model is not just Switchboard\nPhD C: so I wou so that 's good .\nGrad E: Although combining em worked well .\nPhD A: it 's also {disfmarker} I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: uh because\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Like Trent Lott must have been from\nPhD A: mm - hmm , right .\nPhD C: I guess {vocalsound} Switchboard was before\nPhD A: Um By the way just {disfmarker} for fun we also ran ,\nPhD C: uh .\nProfessor B: Good point .\nPhD A: I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: so just for the heck of it I ran that\nGrad E: And it said a hundred percent male ?\nPhD A: um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .\nPhD C: The j\nPhD A: Yeah so\nGrad E: Oh it did ?\nPostdoc G: Oh that 's {disfmarker} I 'm glad .\nGrad E: It got all two genders ?\nPhD C: Yeah but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance\nPhD A: Yeah . Yes .\nPhD C: and uh and that 's interesting cuz I think the {disfmarker} their language models are quite different so and I {disfmarker} I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Right .\nPostdoc G: That makes a lot of sense ,\nPhD C: So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when {disfmarker} when we get new microphones\nPostdoc G: yeah . Very possible .\nProfessor B: Yeah I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would bet on that too\nPhD C: that would be worth it\nProfessor B: cuz he certainly in that {disfmarker} when as a {disfmarker} as a burp user he was {disfmarker} he was a pretty uh strong one .\nPhD C: um Yeah\nGrad E: Sheep .\nPhD C: he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he sounded to me just from {disfmarker} he sounded like a ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: what 's it a sheep or a goat ?\nProfessor B: Sheep .\nGrad E: A sheep .\nPhD C: Sheep ,\nGrad E: Baah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Sheep is good .\nPhD C: right . Sounded good .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right so um so I guess the good news is that\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker} and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no {disfmarker} no tailoring at all .\nPhD A: I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . The voca the vocabulary especially\nGrad E: Or just dictionary .\nPhD C: yeah .\nPhD A: Not that much the vocabulary actually\nPhD C: Yeah , so .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker} um well we have to see but {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . It 's pretty good um so then\nProfessor B: Have to add PZM and so on\nGrad E: And I have to try it on the far field mike\nProfessor B: but\nPhD C: PZM\nGrad E: yeah .\nPhD C: and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL . there 's things like that where , you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but in general it was really good and I 'm hoping {disfmarker} and this is {disfmarker} this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments , I mean it 's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information . For example about , you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times . Um so that 'll be something that actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place . Because it 's just gonna give us time marks\nPhD D: But you know {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Well we 've done that for one meeting .\nPhD C: so . For forced alignment .\nGrad E: Uh oh oh f not for words\nPhD C: Ye - right .\nGrad E: I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not {disfmarker} not for words .\nPhD C: Right . So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and then I was thinking it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription . Maybe actually mark the word boundaries .\nPhD C: Oh or {disfmarker} i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy .\nGrad E: Right , right .\nPhD C: It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around , if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good . So that 's about it .\nProfessor B: I r\nPhD D: I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though , I mean if we 're pr\nGrad E: That we 're starting so well ?\nPhD D: yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody 's gonna do well on\nProfessor B: Oh\nGrad E: Don't worry about it w d that 's that 's the close talking mikes . Try it on the P Z Ms and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor B: Yeah , which {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} well n n n n\nPhD D: So the real value of the database is these ?\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , abso well no but\nProfessor B: I mean there 's still just the w the percentages and , I mean they 're not {disfmarker} a as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps\nPhD C: This i yeah . This is not that good .\nProfessor B: there 's probably overlaps in {disfmarker} in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so but {disfmarker} but there 's other phenomena , it 's a meeting , it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes but uh yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could , I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor B: and uh see if it 's , you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it 's not maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something and {disfmarker} and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: No I think it 's really , I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the {disfmarker} the text um yeah they 're pretty good so and {disfmarker} and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard so that 's good . And um let 's see there was one more thing I wanted to {disfmarker} to mention {disfmarker} I can't remember um Sorry can't remember . anyway it 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Congratulations is really great .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's really good .\nPhD C: so Andreas set up this recognizer and {disfmarker} by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there so I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um so\nPhD A: We {disfmarker} we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . That 's {disfmarker} you know if {disfmarker} if there are more machines um uh here plus people can {disfmarker} could run their own uh you know variants of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the recognition {pause} runs um certainly doable . Um .\nProfessor B: Yeah and {disfmarker} well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Seems reasonable .\nPostdoc G: I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Which is um so this issue {vocalsound} of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted {disfmarker} Yeah , well , so what I mean is um the {disfmarker} uh the data that you take into SRI , first {disfmarker} first question , you 're maintaining it in {disfmarker} in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that {disfmarker} that kind of stuff , right ?\nPhD A: U um\nPhD C: From the outside world or\nPostdoc G: By uh people uh who are not associated with this project .\nPhD A: Oh .\nGrad E: It 's human subjects issues , I told you about that .\nPhD C: Um oh .\nPostdoc G: Exactly .\nPhD C: Well OK we have n no names . Although I sh um\nGrad E: That {disfmarker} that 's not the issue ,\nPhD C: de audio data itself ?\nGrad E: it 's just the audio data itself , until people have a chance to edit it .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm , exactly .\nPhD C: Uh so well I can {disfmarker} I can protect my directories through there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right now they 're not {disfmarker} they 're in the speech group directories which {disfmarker} so I will {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: I didn't know that actually .\nProfessor B: Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,\nPhD C: Yeah OK .\nProfessor B: say it 's OK .\nPhD C: Right OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , we had to get them to approve em and then i cuz {disfmarker} cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's but this {disfmarker} this meeting that you have , no problem cuz I {disfmarker} I well I mean I {disfmarker} I speak for myself\nGrad E: It 's us .\nPostdoc G: but {disfmarker} but I think that we didn't do anything that but well anyway so {vocalsound} uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects\nPhD C: That 's true .\nPostdoc G: and I don't know how that stands , I mean if you {disfmarker} if you get fantastic results and it 's involving {comment} data which {disfmarker} which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know but I wanted to raise that issue ,\nProfessor B: Well we ,\nPostdoc G: that 's all .\nProfessor B: I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it {disfmarker} hopefully it will be fairly quick but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on it 's just that we 're\nGrad E: Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: and get back any bleeps that they want\nPhD C: Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought .\nProfessor B: It 's gonna be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part .\nPhD A: U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling , um I don't know who , I mean how this was done but is {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} are there any um {vocalsound} issues with downsampling\nPhD C: Don did this .\nPhD A: because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly um so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand . And is there any um i are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ?\nGrad F: There are lots of w {vocalsound} there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on ,\nPhD A: OK . Right . OK .\nGrad F: like anti - aliasing stuff .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} th\nGrad E: I don't think we even know which one I assume you 're using syncat to do it ?\nGrad F: No , I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample .\nGrad E: Or sound resample ?\nPhD C: Re - re ref\nGrad E: Resample .\nPhD C: yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms .\nGrad F: RSMP . Yeah , I don't really .\nPhD C: Missing all the vowels .\nGrad F: I just {disfmarker} yeah I found it .\nPhD C: Some of the vowels ,\nGrad E: Not all of them .\nPhD C: almost all the vowels , that 's the hard part .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,\nGrad E: And a few of the consonants .\nPhD A: I mean segment them but not downsample them .\nPhD C: Yeah we could {disfmarker} we could try that and {disfmarker} and compare\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and feed them to {disfmarker} feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if {disfmarker} if the SRI front - end does something .\nGrad F: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I suspect that 's sort of premature optimization , but Sure .\nPhD C: We can try it . I {disfmarker} I only downsampled them first cuz I was\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I mean that 's just one line {disfmarker} that 's one line of code to comment at\nPhD C: yeah\nPhD A: Right and {disfmarker} and it doesn't {disfmarker} is no more work {vocalsound} for um you know for us .\nGrad F: so\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: Well they 're just bigger to transfer , that 's why I s downsampled them before but\nPhD A: Well but they 're only twice as big so\nPhD C: Well I mean that was {disfmarker} if it 's the same then we can downsample here\nPhD A: I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a\nPhD C: but if it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: so , but no , I mean it 's not {disfmarker} i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it {disfmarker}\nPhD C: We could try that .\nPhD A: Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know\nGrad F: it would {disfmarker}\nPhD A: minus the transfer time it would {disfmarker} it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's about a fifty minute drive , right ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why\nPhD C: Well it takes more disk space too so I was just {disfmarker}\nPhD A: and , you know , what {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad F: Mmm . In the front - end we could do that .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So you just train {disfmarker} just different filters\nGrad F: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is\nGrad F: Yeah , I can imagine it would be {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD C: So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences .\nGrad F: I mean I guess there 's some {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD A: So in other words right ,\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that . I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other I don't think that gives you any information .\nPhD C: Well it 's just as easy to {disfmarker} to give you the sixteen K individual ,\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: it was just more disk space you know for storing them\nProfessor B: Are you {disfmarker} are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ?\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: Mel cepstrum .\nProfessor B: So probably doesn't matter .\nPhD C: Well we could try .\nGrad F: There 's {disfmarker} there 's your answer .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but it wouldn't hurt to try ,\nPhD C: Could easily try\nPhD A: That 's what I would assume but you never know ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: you know .\nProfessor B: Sure . No the reason I say this\nPostdoc G: Just {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not {disfmarker} b you wouldn't expect to be so much but\nPhD C: Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti stick them somewhere\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really not a problem .\nPhD A: Actually , no .\nPhD C: and I 'll rerun it with\nPhD A: Don't stop . Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters ,\nGrad F: Keep going . Yeah .\nPhD A: so shouldn't use {disfmarker} you should s you know , get\nGrad F: Yeah , I mean I 'll {disfmarker} I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same ,\nPhD C: OK .\nPhD A:  Right .\nGrad F: it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right . Right .\nGrad F: and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory ,\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: I mean I corrected all {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: that 's not a problem .\nPhD C: I mean I hand - edited the whole {disfmarker} the whole meeting so that can be run it 's just {disfmarker} Once we get the {disfmarker} the bug out .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: One {disfmarker} one question which is I {disfmarker} I had the impression {comment} from this {disfmarker} from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc G: is that I thought that in order to\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: so it was {disfmarker} so it 's like there 's already down\nGrad E: There 's one level that 's already happening right here .\nProfessor B: This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs\nPostdoc G: OK .\nGrad E: Right .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: And it gets downsampled to sixteen .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: And that 's actually said in your meeting ,\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh OK .\nPhD C: that 's how I know that .\nPostdoc G: That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} It 's like are we downsampling to sixteen ?\nProfessor B: It 's a digital audio orientation for the board\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor B: it 's in the monitor so it 's\nPhD C: Thank God it 's not {vocalsound} more than that .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And I have no idea what filter it 's using ,\nGrad F: Is eight kilohertz {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ?\nGrad E: so\nProfessor B: For telephone stuff .\nGrad E: Telephone .\nPhD D: Telephone .\nGrad F: Yeah that 's what I was gonna say , I mean like {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database\nGrad F: so Oh , I see , so .\nProfessor B: and so that was a standard for that sixteen s\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing .\nProfessor B: Sixteen is more common for {disfmarker} for uh broadband stuff that isn't {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: That isn't music .\nProfessor B: that isn't music and isn't telephone ,\nPhD C: And I guess if you 're comparing like {disfmarker} uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: Why is that ?\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: right ? Well I don I mean if it 's any better\nProfessor B: No actually I would think that you would {disfmarker} you would get better {disfmarker} you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike .\nGrad E: All the way around I 'd think .\nProfessor B: Uh but who knows ? I mean we do {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna find all this stuff out ,\nPhD C: Yeah well we could try it .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: we don't know .\nGrad E: We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans .\nPhD C: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um well {disfmarker} well it 's sort of related but um good news also uh I got {disfmarker} well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on {disfmarker} on\nPhD A: They 're less animated .\nPhD C: Well but he has fewer {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he won't have more than eight and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU , so that sounds interesting . As a compliment to our front - end meeting\nGrad E: Dot EDU ?\nPhD C: and um so that 's gonna start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it or {disfmarker} or put a {vocalsound} push a button or something when they wanna make a note about \" oh boy you should probably erase those last few \" or uh \" wait I want this not to be recorded now \" or uh something like that s\nProfessor B: Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ?\nPostdoc G: The cross pads ?\nGrad E: Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads .\nPhD C: Cuz I was thinking you know if {disfmarker} if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know um and this came up talking to {disfmarker} to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate {disfmarker} to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: so I don't know if anyone has ideas or {disfmarker} you could even write down \" oh it 's about three twenty five and \" {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well what I was just suggesting is {disfmarker} is we have these {disfmarker} this cross pad just for this purpose\nGrad E: Yeah , and use that .\nProfessor B: and just use that\nGrad E: Not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: and if we sink it in {disfmarker}\nPhD C: That would be great .\nProfessor B: The other thing is eh\nPhD C: That be great .\nProfessor B: I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ?\nGrad E: I don't know . I don't know . I 'll send mail to Dan and ask . I {disfmarker} I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it 's one board with two digital channels .\nProfessor B: Oh it is one board .\nGrad E: E eight each . So it {disfmarker} it takes two fibers in to the one board . And so w I think if we wanna do that {disfmarker} more than that we 'd have to have two boards , and then you have the synchronization issue .\nProfessor B: But that 's a question because that would {disfmarker} if it was possible cuz it is i you know already we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor B: and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store , right it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: What is the limit on each of those f fiber channels , is it the\nGrad E: Eight .\nPhD D: It just {disfmarker} it 's eight channels come in , does it have do with the sampling rate ?\nGrad E: It 's eight . I have no idea . But each {disfmarker} each fiber channel has eight {disfmarker} eight channels and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card .\nProfessor B: It might be a hard limitation ,\nGrad E: So\nProfessor B: I mean one thing is it {disfmarker} the whole thing as I said is {disfmarker} is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes requirements up a bit\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: but\nPhD D: I was just wondering if {disfmarker} if that could change .\nGrad E: I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff .\nPhD D: If we could drop that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: So I {disfmarker} I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK on the uh are we done with that ? So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes , so I got a quote um We can fit {disfmarker} we have room for one more wireless and the wireless , this unit here is three fifty {disfmarker} three hundred fifty dollars , it {disfmarker} I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner {disfmarker} the receiver {disfmarker} the other end , that 's uh four thirty um and then also\nPhD C: For {disfmarker} for each ?\nPhD D: Wow .\nPhD C: I mean the tuner is four thirty for each .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: Wow .\nGrad E: And we just need one more so {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: Yeah at least w we got the good ones .\nGrad E: Yeah . So that 's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these .\nProfessor B: Yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: So if we wanna use a different set {disfmarker} headset the solution that the guy suggested and they {disfmarker} apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . And that 's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece and the {disfmarker} he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece .\nProfessor B: There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in , you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ?\nGrad E: Becau - the reason is the only {disfmarker} only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector .\nProfessor B: No I understand . The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this .\nGrad E: Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us ,\nPhD D: Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too ,\nGrad E: so .\nProfessor B: Well\nPhD D: they 'd\nProfessor B: no they 'll just charge us more , so it 's {disfmarker} this\nPhD D: Mmm .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker} so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?\nProfessor B: Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .\nGrad E: So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And {disfmarker} and see if that works .\nProfessor B: And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more .\nPhD C: Comfort .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK it 's just the {disfmarker} the\nGrad E: Right , it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: Could make our own handbands and\nGrad E: Um , and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA and so it will take about a week to get here .\nProfessor B: Yeah well it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um so OK to just go order ?\nProfessor B: We 're in this for the long term , yeah . Just order it .\nGrad E: OK\nPhD C: It 's a lot of money for a handband .\nGrad E: and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: cuz I think that 's how we did it before .\nProfessor B: Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a long time to get from LA .\nGrad E: OK . And then nine channels is the maximum we can do , so .\nProfessor B: Uh y right cuz {disfmarker} so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen\nGrad E: Without getting more stuff .\nProfessor B: and there 's six on the table so that 's nine .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Can I ask a really dumb question ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is there any way we can have you know like a {disfmarker} a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk that {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Probably .\nProfessor B: That 's a good idea .\nPhD C: I mean {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: That 's not a dumb question , it 's a good idea ,\nPhD C: Well I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the\nGrad F: That 's like the Conch .\nPhD C: Well but {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Like at conferences\nPhD A: you know r\nPhD C: well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people\nGrad F: See , look .\nPhD C: um and I don't know identifying somehow ?\nPhD D: so nail the chairs down .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , somehow .\nPhD C: You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer .\nGrad E: It 's not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: No that {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} no\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: that 's a very {disfmarker} if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work .\nPhD D: The Springer mike .\nPhD C: I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that .\nProfessor B: Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: A hand - held , yeah .\nProfessor B: that 's a good idea\nPhD D: Infinite expansion .\nProfessor B: Right . Kind of rules out overlap but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but uh\nPhD C: Well or also for you know if people are not\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Well we could just hand around the lapel .\nProfessor B: Uh no {disfmarker} no that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Rather than get a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No not the lapel .\nGrad E: do you want a handset ?\nProfessor B: No .\nGrad E: Well I mean is the {disfmarker} is the hand - held really any better ?\nPhD D: Liz hates the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yes .\nPhD C: I don't know\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: but I d I know the lapel is really suboptimal .\nProfessor B: No it {disfmarker} no it depends on the hand - held\nGrad E: Is awful ?\nProfessor B: but hand {disfmarker} many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it {disfmarker} it is less uh susceptible to hand noises . If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Right . I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of OK .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nGrad E: So I wonder if they have one that will hook up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . They have {disfmarker} What ?\nGrad E: I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves .\nPhD D: Well , you wouldn't want it to hook there you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room , right ?\nProfessor B: No that 's uh {disfmarker} you need a transmitter .\nGrad E: What ?\nPhD D: Is th isn't that built into the mike ?\nProfessor B: Oh I see . Get a {disfmarker} get a different radio , yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless\nProfessor B: Yeah . But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .\nPhD D: Have a little antenna coming out the bottom .\nGrad E: It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike , isn't it ?\nPhD D: But then the mike has to h\nPhD A: Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of\nProfessor B: No no {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: so right , so this is a good point , so yeah you have these {disfmarker} these mikes with a little antenna on the end right ?\nGrad E: OK . And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?\nProfessor B: I don't know . You 'll have to check with them ,\nGrad E: OK I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll ask .\nProfessor B: yeah . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's a great idea\nPhD D: It 's just a frequency .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then just sort of have that as the {disfmarker} and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and {disfmarker} and uh\nPhD C: Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large {disfmarker} the larger the group the less interaction {disfmarker} the less people are talking um over each other {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Pretty soon .\nPhD D: Mmm , yeah .\nPhD C: it just {disfmarker} there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: Um Gotta go .\nProfessor B: Off you go , yeah .\nGrad E: OK so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?\nPostdoc G: I {disfmarker} I thought of some extra {disfmarker} a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention .\nGrad E: OK .\nPostdoc G: One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine\nGrad E: uh Yep ,\nPostdoc G: and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month , I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten .\nPhD C: Uh it 's great {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Pretty close ,\nPostdoc G: So they 're still working .\nProfessor B: that 's good .\nPhD C: I j and this {disfmarker} I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something\nPhD D: Wow .\nGrad E: that 's good .\nPhD C: so it 's really great\nPostdoc G: It 's working out , thanks .\nPhD C: It 's really great .\nPostdoc G: Thanks . And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data It 's sort of a {disfmarker} a little bit {disfmarker} a little bit\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nProfessor B: Super idea .\nGrad E: Yep , that 'd be very interesting .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things ,\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'd love to hear what they have to say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's a great idea .\nPhD D: So if we got them to talk about this meeting , it would be a meta {disfmarker} meta meeting .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah , exa {vocalsound} exactly I guess {disfmarker} nested several layers ,\nProfessor B: Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us\nPostdoc G: but\nProfessor B: so how do we do this , is the only thing .\nPhD C: Or just have them talk amongst themselves .\nPhD D: Have them have their own meeting .\nPhD C: And have\nPostdoc G: Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,\nProfessor B: Oh .\nPostdoc G: yeah . Have them talk about the data and they {disfmarker} and they 've made observations to me\nPhD C: that would be great .\nPostdoc G: like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , you know it 's part of it 's {disfmarker} it 's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nGrad E: Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Be great .\nProfessor B: So maybe we could {disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Give us a status .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh good . OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .\nGrad E: Great .\nGrad J: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be {disfmarker} I 'll be working on this .\nGrad E: And are you staying at Berkeley or is {disfmarker} are you just here a semester ?\nGrad J: This is my second semester and last .\nGrad E: Ah second and last ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad J: So I leave\nProfessor B: He 's in the {disfmarker} he 's in the cour two two five D course .\nGrad J: Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course ,\nProfessor B: So , yeah .\nGrad J: yeah .\nGrad E: Good .\nPhD D: Welcome .\nPostdoc G: Then you {disfmarker} then you go back to Norway , that 's OK .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nGrad F: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the {vocalsound} echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK ,\nGrad E: Digits ?\nProfessor B: let 's do digits . OK .\nGrad E: And stop .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was decided on the microphone procedures?\nAnswer:", "input": "What was decided on the microphone procedures?", "context": "Grad F: Test .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: Let 's see , I should be Two .\nPhD D: Up high {disfmarker}\nGrad E: As close to your mouth as you can get it .\nProfessor B: La\nPhD D: high as you can get .\nProfessor B: Is this channel one ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah , on your upper lip .\nPhD H: Channel one one one .\nProfessor B: Gee , OK . Yes . OK .\nGrad E: OK , so for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} For people wearing the wireless mikes , like {disfmarker} like this one , I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this {disfmarker} this sorta like that .\nPhD H: This is {disfmarker} chan channel channel one one two three\nGrad F: Channel five , channel five .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Mm - hmm . What do you do ,\nGrad E: It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples ,\nGrad F: Test , test test .\nProfessor B: you do it higher ?\nGrad E: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , I think we 're supposed to {disfmarker} that 's right .\nGrad E: And then also , for {disfmarker} for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth ,\nGrad F: Test test .\nPhD A: By the way , there was a bug . Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper\nPhD D: Oh it was .\nGrad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth ,\nPhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: so about like I 'm wearing it now .\nPhD D: Oh that 's interesting . So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nGrad E: so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth ,\nPhD H: It 's not always possible .\nPhD A: Hmm ?\nPhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nPostdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: Is that @ @ ? OK , thank you .\nGrad F: Adam , I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD D: O Oh oh I see .\nGrad F: uh , looks kinda low on channel five {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I see , I see .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad F: no ?\nGrad E: Channel five , s speak again .\nGrad F: Maybe not .\nPostdoc G: Hello .\nPhD A: Basically there were no counts\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's alright .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad E: I mean , we could {disfmarker} we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to .\nGrad F: It 's OK ?\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad F: Is this OK ?\nPhD H: OK .\nPhD D: I see what you mean .\nPhD C: Who 's channel B ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker} Uh , channel B is probably Liz .\nPhD C: Uh oh .\nPhD H: Uh channel B {disfmarker} I am channel B .\nProfessor B: You wanna close this ,\nPostdoc G: Channel eight , eight .\nProfessor B: or\nPhD C: No I\nGrad E: Thank you .\nPhD H: No , channel B .\nPhD A: Hello , hello .\nPhD C: yeah , yeah , you 're channel B .\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah .\nPhD C: So can you talk a bit ? I thought it might be too\nPhD H: OK , yeah , channel B , one two three four five .\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's alright . So , the gain isn't real good .\nProfessor B: We 're recording ,\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor B: right ?\nGrad E: OK , so we are recording .\nPhD H: Ah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: Um we {disfmarker} we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it . And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .\nPhD H: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: We {disfmarker} we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank . Um I {disfmarker} I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: so\nPhD D: California .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: California .\nPhD H: California .\nPhD A: Um may I make one suggestion ? Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth\nGrad E: Sure .\nPhD A: because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .\nGrad E: Oh .\nPhD C: A actually , wait a minute ,\nGrad E: Birth year ?\nPostdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around ?\nPhD D: Not for me .\nPostdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the other side ,\nPhD A: Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: O yeah .\nPhD D: But there 's no other date on the form .\nPhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nPostdoc G: Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .\nGrad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .\nPhD A: Anyway .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , that 's true .\nPhD C: I still don't see the problem .\nGrad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is alright\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: so , anyway . And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time , the speaker form only once , the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting . OK ? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form . And that should just be one person whose name I don't know . OK ?\nGrad F: Do you want this {pause} Adam ?\nGrad E: Uh sure . Thank you .\nProfessor B: So uh\nGrad E: OK so should we do agenda items ?\nProfessor B: Uh oh that 's a good idea . I shouldn't run the meeting .\nGrad E: Uh well I have {disfmarker} I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results . Anything else ?\nPhD C: I guess {disfmarker} what time do we have to leave ? Three thirty ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nGrad E: Why don't you go first then .\nPhD C: so .\nProfessor B: Yeah , good idea .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Um Well , I {disfmarker} I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams {disfmarker} a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who {disfmarker} Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um {vocalsound} you know separated {disfmarker} used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so {disfmarker} so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that {disfmarker} that 's twenty minutes or so ? Um yeah because I guess there 's some ,\nGrad E: Or so .\nPhD C: and Don can talk to Jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm {disfmarker} we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} was that {disfmarker} did that {disfmarker} did that recording have the glitch in the middle ?\nPostdoc G: I 'm puzzled by that . I {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} oh , I see .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Oh there was a glitch somewhere .\nPhD C: yeah , so that actually um\nGrad F: Was it twenty minutes in ,\nPhD C: if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know\nPostdoc G: I forgot about that .\nGrad F: I thought {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well it was interesting ,\nPostdoc G: Well , I mean , they {disfmarker}\nPhD A: suddenly {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent\nGrad E: I don't remember when it is .\nPostdoc G: but I was able to can transcribe\nPhD A: but i looking at {disfmarker} the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the {disfmarker} it was actually recognized\nPhD C: Wel\nGrad E: Oh no .\nGrad F: Yeah , that might be {disfmarker} that might be {disfmarker} that might be my fault .\nPostdoc G: Wow .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .\nGrad F: I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: No actually it was {disfmarker} yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um\nGrad F: yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time ,\nPostdoc G: Oh . That 's not good .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: so that 's what we have\nGrad E: Alright .\nGrad F: so\nPhD C: but that {disfmarker} that will be completely gone if this synch time problem\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: The {disfmarker} the glitch\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to\nPostdoc G: And the only glitch {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: yeah .\nPhD C: So you guys know .\nProfessor B: S sorry I haven't seen the email ,\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Th - the\nPostdoc G: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} wait\nProfessor B: what was the score ?\nPhD C: So here 's the actual copy of the email\nPostdoc G: we should say something about the glitch . He {disfmarker} he can say something about the glitch .\nPhD C: um oh OK\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Cuz it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} h it 's {disfmarker} it 's very small {disfmarker}\nPhD C: so does this glitch occur at other {disfmarker}\nGrad E: There {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized\nPostdoc G: very small . Yep .\nPhD C: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad E: so the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad E: and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing {disfmarker} doing click sounds .\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And is it only once that that happens ?\nGrad E: But yeah\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: it {disfmarker} right once in the middle .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong\nProfessor B: so {disfmarker} so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice ,\nPhD C: but\nGrad E: Um But that shouldn't affect anything\nPhD C: OK so that 's actually\nPostdoc G: S and it {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: you see this here ?\nPhD C: It {disfmarker} y it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah yeah \" bah \"\nPhD C: OK no {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: What happens is it actually affects the script that Don {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Huh .\nPhD C: I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it\nGrad E: Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything .\nPhD C: but they\nGrad F: Yeah , I don't know exactly what affected it\nPostdoc G: I agree . I agree .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I have {disfmarker}\nGrad F: but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you about it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: But I {disfmarker} I do remember {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: I 'll show you the point .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . It {disfmarker} it had no effect on my transcription ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: you know , I mean I {disfmarker} I had no trouble hearing it and {disfmarker} and having time bins\nGrad E: I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .\nPostdoc G: but there was a {disfmarker} Oh .\nPhD C: Well , the {disfmarker} the synch time {disfmarker} the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should ,\nGrad F: That 's what happened .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad E: Where {disfmarker} where they weren't monotonic .\nGrad F: There was {disfmarker} yeah , I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: right ? There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh , interesting .\nPhD C: And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right\nGrad E: Oh OK so that 's\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: so anyway it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah sounds like a bug .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Non - zero ? Um there are like more {disfmarker} cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran ,\nGrad E: The other one I saw was that it yeah .\nGrad F: I mean but there were there was a point .\nPhD C: Yeah that was fine . That {disfmarker} that was OK .\nGrad E: The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: and that definitely indicra indicates a bug .\nGrad F: Uh .\nPhD C: Well that would really be a problem , yeah . So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: um and what 's {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So that 's very encouraging .\nPhD C: this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Cool .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which\nPhD D: Trent Lott .\nPhD C: um I mean these are sort of funny ones ,\nPhD D: It 'll get those though .\nPhD C: there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see\nGrad E: I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: but um it 's pretty good .\nGrad E: because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ?\nPhD C: Well so I guess we can generate\nGrad E: Sounds likes ?\nPhD A: There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where {disfmarker} got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Yeah , and who cares ? And {disfmarker} and there were lots of {disfmarker} of course the \" uh uh \" - s , \" in on \" - s \" of uh \" - s .\nPhD A: Mmm , so if {disfmarker}\nPhD C: there 's {disfmarker} No those are actually\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or\nGrad E: Right . Ri - ri right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Did you say there 's no language for PZM ?\nPhD C: No language model , I mean those {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean {disfmarker} so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings .\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet .\nProfessor B: Well , we don't even know what that means ,\nPhD C: so {vocalsound} but this is really encouraging because\nProfessor B: so I\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right .\nPhD C: so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of {disfmarker} of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained {disfmarker} mostly trained recognizer\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and Switchboard - two is {disfmarker} got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic\nGrad E: Excellent .\nPhD C: and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did {disfmarker} had the ninety - three workshop\nPhD C: Um\nProfessor B: and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Oh yeah\nProfessor B: you know\nPhD C: I mean this is really ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: Well especially for the very first run , I mean you {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh it 's the {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: eh um\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: yeah\nGrad E: the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but\nPhD C: So and what al also this means is that\nPostdoc G: Right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Not Switchboard ,\nPhD A: Well it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people\nGrad E: uh Broadcast News .\nPhD C: especially I guess um with Jane that {disfmarker} that would help for {disfmarker} since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring . I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so you know the language model was straight from {disfmarker} from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or {disfmarker} or\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nGrad E: Yeah , so that 's great .\nPhD C: No .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: And actually {disfmarker} we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nPhD A: Well that 's {disfmarker} those are the only we ones there are ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: which I guess\nPhD D: I was just gonna say ,\nPhD C: so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of\nPhD D: yeah .\nPhD A: I mean\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: and I guess Ramana , so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: it 's {disfmarker} it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech .\nPhD D: It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech\nPhD C: So .\nPhD A: Oh yeah .\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah ,\nPhD C: Right , so it 's {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: but for Broadcast News when we {disfmarker} we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss .\nGrad E: Right , it was not a big deal .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: I should {disfmarker} I should say that {disfmarker} the language model is not just Switchboard\nPhD C: so I wou so that 's good .\nGrad E: Although combining em worked well .\nPhD A: it 's also {disfmarker} I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: uh because\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Like Trent Lott must have been from\nPhD A: mm - hmm , right .\nPhD C: I guess {vocalsound} Switchboard was before\nPhD A: Um By the way just {disfmarker} for fun we also ran ,\nPhD C: uh .\nProfessor B: Good point .\nPhD A: I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: so just for the heck of it I ran that\nGrad E: And it said a hundred percent male ?\nPhD A: um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .\nPhD C: The j\nPhD A: Yeah so\nGrad E: Oh it did ?\nPostdoc G: Oh that 's {disfmarker} I 'm glad .\nGrad E: It got all two genders ?\nPhD C: Yeah but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance\nPhD A: Yeah . Yes .\nPhD C: and uh and that 's interesting cuz I think the {disfmarker} their language models are quite different so and I {disfmarker} I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Right .\nPostdoc G: That makes a lot of sense ,\nPhD C: So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when {disfmarker} when we get new microphones\nPostdoc G: yeah . Very possible .\nProfessor B: Yeah I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would bet on that too\nPhD C: that would be worth it\nProfessor B: cuz he certainly in that {disfmarker} when as a {disfmarker} as a burp user he was {disfmarker} he was a pretty uh strong one .\nPhD C: um Yeah\nGrad E: Sheep .\nPhD C: he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he sounded to me just from {disfmarker} he sounded like a ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: what 's it a sheep or a goat ?\nProfessor B: Sheep .\nGrad E: A sheep .\nPhD C: Sheep ,\nGrad E: Baah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Sheep is good .\nPhD C: right . Sounded good .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right so um so I guess the good news is that\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker} and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no {disfmarker} no tailoring at all .\nPhD A: I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . The voca the vocabulary especially\nGrad E: Or just dictionary .\nPhD C: yeah .\nPhD A: Not that much the vocabulary actually\nPhD C: Yeah , so .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker} um well we have to see but {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . It 's pretty good um so then\nProfessor B: Have to add PZM and so on\nGrad E: And I have to try it on the far field mike\nProfessor B: but\nPhD C: PZM\nGrad E: yeah .\nPhD C: and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL . there 's things like that where , you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but in general it was really good and I 'm hoping {disfmarker} and this is {disfmarker} this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments , I mean it 's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information . For example about , you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times . Um so that 'll be something that actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place . Because it 's just gonna give us time marks\nPhD D: But you know {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Well we 've done that for one meeting .\nPhD C: so . For forced alignment .\nGrad E: Uh oh oh f not for words\nPhD C: Ye - right .\nGrad E: I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not {disfmarker} not for words .\nPhD C: Right . So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and then I was thinking it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription . Maybe actually mark the word boundaries .\nPhD C: Oh or {disfmarker} i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy .\nGrad E: Right , right .\nPhD C: It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around , if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good . So that 's about it .\nProfessor B: I r\nPhD D: I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though , I mean if we 're pr\nGrad E: That we 're starting so well ?\nPhD D: yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody 's gonna do well on\nProfessor B: Oh\nGrad E: Don't worry about it w d that 's that 's the close talking mikes . Try it on the P Z Ms and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor B: Yeah , which {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} well n n n n\nPhD D: So the real value of the database is these ?\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , abso well no but\nProfessor B: I mean there 's still just the w the percentages and , I mean they 're not {disfmarker} a as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps\nPhD C: This i yeah . This is not that good .\nProfessor B: there 's probably overlaps in {disfmarker} in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so but {disfmarker} but there 's other phenomena , it 's a meeting , it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes but uh yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could , I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor B: and uh see if it 's , you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it 's not maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something and {disfmarker} and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: No I think it 's really , I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the {disfmarker} the text um yeah they 're pretty good so and {disfmarker} and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard so that 's good . And um let 's see there was one more thing I wanted to {disfmarker} to mention {disfmarker} I can't remember um Sorry can't remember . anyway it 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Congratulations is really great .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's really good .\nPhD C: so Andreas set up this recognizer and {disfmarker} by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there so I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um so\nPhD A: We {disfmarker} we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . That 's {disfmarker} you know if {disfmarker} if there are more machines um uh here plus people can {disfmarker} could run their own uh you know variants of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the recognition {pause} runs um certainly doable . Um .\nProfessor B: Yeah and {disfmarker} well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Seems reasonable .\nPostdoc G: I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Which is um so this issue {vocalsound} of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted {disfmarker} Yeah , well , so what I mean is um the {disfmarker} uh the data that you take into SRI , first {disfmarker} first question , you 're maintaining it in {disfmarker} in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that {disfmarker} that kind of stuff , right ?\nPhD A: U um\nPhD C: From the outside world or\nPostdoc G: By uh people uh who are not associated with this project .\nPhD A: Oh .\nGrad E: It 's human subjects issues , I told you about that .\nPhD C: Um oh .\nPostdoc G: Exactly .\nPhD C: Well OK we have n no names . Although I sh um\nGrad E: That {disfmarker} that 's not the issue ,\nPhD C: de audio data itself ?\nGrad E: it 's just the audio data itself , until people have a chance to edit it .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm , exactly .\nPhD C: Uh so well I can {disfmarker} I can protect my directories through there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right now they 're not {disfmarker} they 're in the speech group directories which {disfmarker} so I will {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: I didn't know that actually .\nProfessor B: Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,\nPhD C: Yeah OK .\nProfessor B: say it 's OK .\nPhD C: Right OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , we had to get them to approve em and then i cuz {disfmarker} cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's but this {disfmarker} this meeting that you have , no problem cuz I {disfmarker} I well I mean I {disfmarker} I speak for myself\nGrad E: It 's us .\nPostdoc G: but {disfmarker} but I think that we didn't do anything that but well anyway so {vocalsound} uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects\nPhD C: That 's true .\nPostdoc G: and I don't know how that stands , I mean if you {disfmarker} if you get fantastic results and it 's involving {comment} data which {disfmarker} which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know but I wanted to raise that issue ,\nProfessor B: Well we ,\nPostdoc G: that 's all .\nProfessor B: I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it {disfmarker} hopefully it will be fairly quick but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on it 's just that we 're\nGrad E: Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: and get back any bleeps that they want\nPhD C: Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought .\nProfessor B: It 's gonna be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part .\nPhD A: U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling , um I don't know who , I mean how this was done but is {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} are there any um {vocalsound} issues with downsampling\nPhD C: Don did this .\nPhD A: because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly um so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand . And is there any um i are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ?\nGrad F: There are lots of w {vocalsound} there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on ,\nPhD A: OK . Right . OK .\nGrad F: like anti - aliasing stuff .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} th\nGrad E: I don't think we even know which one I assume you 're using syncat to do it ?\nGrad F: No , I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample .\nGrad E: Or sound resample ?\nPhD C: Re - re ref\nGrad E: Resample .\nPhD C: yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms .\nGrad F: RSMP . Yeah , I don't really .\nPhD C: Missing all the vowels .\nGrad F: I just {disfmarker} yeah I found it .\nPhD C: Some of the vowels ,\nGrad E: Not all of them .\nPhD C: almost all the vowels , that 's the hard part .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,\nGrad E: And a few of the consonants .\nPhD A: I mean segment them but not downsample them .\nPhD C: Yeah we could {disfmarker} we could try that and {disfmarker} and compare\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and feed them to {disfmarker} feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if {disfmarker} if the SRI front - end does something .\nGrad F: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I suspect that 's sort of premature optimization , but Sure .\nPhD C: We can try it . I {disfmarker} I only downsampled them first cuz I was\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I mean that 's just one line {disfmarker} that 's one line of code to comment at\nPhD C: yeah\nPhD A: Right and {disfmarker} and it doesn't {disfmarker} is no more work {vocalsound} for um you know for us .\nGrad F: so\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: Well they 're just bigger to transfer , that 's why I s downsampled them before but\nPhD A: Well but they 're only twice as big so\nPhD C: Well I mean that was {disfmarker} if it 's the same then we can downsample here\nPhD A: I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a\nPhD C: but if it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: so , but no , I mean it 's not {disfmarker} i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it {disfmarker}\nPhD C: We could try that .\nPhD A: Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know\nGrad F: it would {disfmarker}\nPhD A: minus the transfer time it would {disfmarker} it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's about a fifty minute drive , right ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why\nPhD C: Well it takes more disk space too so I was just {disfmarker}\nPhD A: and , you know , what {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad F: Mmm . In the front - end we could do that .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So you just train {disfmarker} just different filters\nGrad F: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is\nGrad F: Yeah , I can imagine it would be {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD C: So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences .\nGrad F: I mean I guess there 's some {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD A: So in other words right ,\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that . I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other I don't think that gives you any information .\nPhD C: Well it 's just as easy to {disfmarker} to give you the sixteen K individual ,\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: it was just more disk space you know for storing them\nProfessor B: Are you {disfmarker} are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ?\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: Mel cepstrum .\nProfessor B: So probably doesn't matter .\nPhD C: Well we could try .\nGrad F: There 's {disfmarker} there 's your answer .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but it wouldn't hurt to try ,\nPhD C: Could easily try\nPhD A: That 's what I would assume but you never know ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: you know .\nProfessor B: Sure . No the reason I say this\nPostdoc G: Just {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not {disfmarker} b you wouldn't expect to be so much but\nPhD C: Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti stick them somewhere\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really not a problem .\nPhD A: Actually , no .\nPhD C: and I 'll rerun it with\nPhD A: Don't stop . Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters ,\nGrad F: Keep going . Yeah .\nPhD A: so shouldn't use {disfmarker} you should s you know , get\nGrad F: Yeah , I mean I 'll {disfmarker} I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same ,\nPhD C: OK .\nPhD A:  Right .\nGrad F: it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right . Right .\nGrad F: and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory ,\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: I mean I corrected all {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: that 's not a problem .\nPhD C: I mean I hand - edited the whole {disfmarker} the whole meeting so that can be run it 's just {disfmarker} Once we get the {disfmarker} the bug out .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: One {disfmarker} one question which is I {disfmarker} I had the impression {comment} from this {disfmarker} from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc G: is that I thought that in order to\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: so it was {disfmarker} so it 's like there 's already down\nGrad E: There 's one level that 's already happening right here .\nProfessor B: This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs\nPostdoc G: OK .\nGrad E: Right .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: And it gets downsampled to sixteen .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: And that 's actually said in your meeting ,\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh OK .\nPhD C: that 's how I know that .\nPostdoc G: That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} It 's like are we downsampling to sixteen ?\nProfessor B: It 's a digital audio orientation for the board\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor B: it 's in the monitor so it 's\nPhD C: Thank God it 's not {vocalsound} more than that .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And I have no idea what filter it 's using ,\nGrad F: Is eight kilohertz {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ?\nGrad E: so\nProfessor B: For telephone stuff .\nGrad E: Telephone .\nPhD D: Telephone .\nGrad F: Yeah that 's what I was gonna say , I mean like {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database\nGrad F: so Oh , I see , so .\nProfessor B: and so that was a standard for that sixteen s\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing .\nProfessor B: Sixteen is more common for {disfmarker} for uh broadband stuff that isn't {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: That isn't music .\nProfessor B: that isn't music and isn't telephone ,\nPhD C: And I guess if you 're comparing like {disfmarker} uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: Why is that ?\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: right ? Well I don I mean if it 's any better\nProfessor B: No actually I would think that you would {disfmarker} you would get better {disfmarker} you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike .\nGrad E: All the way around I 'd think .\nProfessor B: Uh but who knows ? I mean we do {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna find all this stuff out ,\nPhD C: Yeah well we could try it .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: we don't know .\nGrad E: We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans .\nPhD C: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um well {disfmarker} well it 's sort of related but um good news also uh I got {disfmarker} well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on {disfmarker} on\nPhD A: They 're less animated .\nPhD C: Well but he has fewer {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he won't have more than eight and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU , so that sounds interesting . As a compliment to our front - end meeting\nGrad E: Dot EDU ?\nPhD C: and um so that 's gonna start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it or {disfmarker} or put a {vocalsound} push a button or something when they wanna make a note about \" oh boy you should probably erase those last few \" or uh \" wait I want this not to be recorded now \" or uh something like that s\nProfessor B: Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ?\nPostdoc G: The cross pads ?\nGrad E: Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads .\nPhD C: Cuz I was thinking you know if {disfmarker} if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know um and this came up talking to {disfmarker} to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate {disfmarker} to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: so I don't know if anyone has ideas or {disfmarker} you could even write down \" oh it 's about three twenty five and \" {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well what I was just suggesting is {disfmarker} is we have these {disfmarker} this cross pad just for this purpose\nGrad E: Yeah , and use that .\nProfessor B: and just use that\nGrad E: Not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: and if we sink it in {disfmarker}\nPhD C: That would be great .\nProfessor B: The other thing is eh\nPhD C: That be great .\nProfessor B: I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ?\nGrad E: I don't know . I don't know . I 'll send mail to Dan and ask . I {disfmarker} I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it 's one board with two digital channels .\nProfessor B: Oh it is one board .\nGrad E: E eight each . So it {disfmarker} it takes two fibers in to the one board . And so w I think if we wanna do that {disfmarker} more than that we 'd have to have two boards , and then you have the synchronization issue .\nProfessor B: But that 's a question because that would {disfmarker} if it was possible cuz it is i you know already we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor B: and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store , right it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: What is the limit on each of those f fiber channels , is it the\nGrad E: Eight .\nPhD D: It just {disfmarker} it 's eight channels come in , does it have do with the sampling rate ?\nGrad E: It 's eight . I have no idea . But each {disfmarker} each fiber channel has eight {disfmarker} eight channels and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card .\nProfessor B: It might be a hard limitation ,\nGrad E: So\nProfessor B: I mean one thing is it {disfmarker} the whole thing as I said is {disfmarker} is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes requirements up a bit\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: but\nPhD D: I was just wondering if {disfmarker} if that could change .\nGrad E: I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff .\nPhD D: If we could drop that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: So I {disfmarker} I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK on the uh are we done with that ? So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes , so I got a quote um We can fit {disfmarker} we have room for one more wireless and the wireless , this unit here is three fifty {disfmarker} three hundred fifty dollars , it {disfmarker} I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner {disfmarker} the receiver {disfmarker} the other end , that 's uh four thirty um and then also\nPhD C: For {disfmarker} for each ?\nPhD D: Wow .\nPhD C: I mean the tuner is four thirty for each .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: Wow .\nGrad E: And we just need one more so {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: Yeah at least w we got the good ones .\nGrad E: Yeah . So that 's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these .\nProfessor B: Yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: So if we wanna use a different set {disfmarker} headset the solution that the guy suggested and they {disfmarker} apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . And that 's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece and the {disfmarker} he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece .\nProfessor B: There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in , you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ?\nGrad E: Becau - the reason is the only {disfmarker} only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector .\nProfessor B: No I understand . The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this .\nGrad E: Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us ,\nPhD D: Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too ,\nGrad E: so .\nProfessor B: Well\nPhD D: they 'd\nProfessor B: no they 'll just charge us more , so it 's {disfmarker} this\nPhD D: Mmm .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker} so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?\nProfessor B: Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .\nGrad E: So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And {disfmarker} and see if that works .\nProfessor B: And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more .\nPhD C: Comfort .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK it 's just the {disfmarker} the\nGrad E: Right , it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: Could make our own handbands and\nGrad E: Um , and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA and so it will take about a week to get here .\nProfessor B: Yeah well it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um so OK to just go order ?\nProfessor B: We 're in this for the long term , yeah . Just order it .\nGrad E: OK\nPhD C: It 's a lot of money for a handband .\nGrad E: and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: cuz I think that 's how we did it before .\nProfessor B: Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a long time to get from LA .\nGrad E: OK . And then nine channels is the maximum we can do , so .\nProfessor B: Uh y right cuz {disfmarker} so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen\nGrad E: Without getting more stuff .\nProfessor B: and there 's six on the table so that 's nine .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Can I ask a really dumb question ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is there any way we can have you know like a {disfmarker} a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk that {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Probably .\nProfessor B: That 's a good idea .\nPhD C: I mean {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: That 's not a dumb question , it 's a good idea ,\nPhD C: Well I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the\nGrad F: That 's like the Conch .\nPhD C: Well but {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Like at conferences\nPhD A: you know r\nPhD C: well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people\nGrad F: See , look .\nPhD C: um and I don't know identifying somehow ?\nPhD D: so nail the chairs down .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , somehow .\nPhD C: You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer .\nGrad E: It 's not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: No that {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} no\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: that 's a very {disfmarker} if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work .\nPhD D: The Springer mike .\nPhD C: I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that .\nProfessor B: Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: A hand - held , yeah .\nProfessor B: that 's a good idea\nPhD D: Infinite expansion .\nProfessor B: Right . Kind of rules out overlap but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but uh\nPhD C: Well or also for you know if people are not\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Well we could just hand around the lapel .\nProfessor B: Uh no {disfmarker} no that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Rather than get a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No not the lapel .\nGrad E: do you want a handset ?\nProfessor B: No .\nGrad E: Well I mean is the {disfmarker} is the hand - held really any better ?\nPhD D: Liz hates the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yes .\nPhD C: I don't know\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: but I d I know the lapel is really suboptimal .\nProfessor B: No it {disfmarker} no it depends on the hand - held\nGrad E: Is awful ?\nProfessor B: but hand {disfmarker} many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it {disfmarker} it is less uh susceptible to hand noises . If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Right . I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of OK .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nGrad E: So I wonder if they have one that will hook up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . They have {disfmarker} What ?\nGrad E: I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves .\nPhD D: Well , you wouldn't want it to hook there you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room , right ?\nProfessor B: No that 's uh {disfmarker} you need a transmitter .\nGrad E: What ?\nPhD D: Is th isn't that built into the mike ?\nProfessor B: Oh I see . Get a {disfmarker} get a different radio , yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless\nProfessor B: Yeah . But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .\nPhD D: Have a little antenna coming out the bottom .\nGrad E: It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike , isn't it ?\nPhD D: But then the mike has to h\nPhD A: Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of\nProfessor B: No no {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: so right , so this is a good point , so yeah you have these {disfmarker} these mikes with a little antenna on the end right ?\nGrad E: OK . And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?\nProfessor B: I don't know . You 'll have to check with them ,\nGrad E: OK I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll ask .\nProfessor B: yeah . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's a great idea\nPhD D: It 's just a frequency .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then just sort of have that as the {disfmarker} and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and {disfmarker} and uh\nPhD C: Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large {disfmarker} the larger the group the less interaction {disfmarker} the less people are talking um over each other {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Pretty soon .\nPhD D: Mmm , yeah .\nPhD C: it just {disfmarker} there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: Um Gotta go .\nProfessor B: Off you go , yeah .\nGrad E: OK so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?\nPostdoc G: I {disfmarker} I thought of some extra {disfmarker} a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention .\nGrad E: OK .\nPostdoc G: One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine\nGrad E: uh Yep ,\nPostdoc G: and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month , I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten .\nPhD C: Uh it 's great {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Pretty close ,\nPostdoc G: So they 're still working .\nProfessor B: that 's good .\nPhD C: I j and this {disfmarker} I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something\nPhD D: Wow .\nGrad E: that 's good .\nPhD C: so it 's really great\nPostdoc G: It 's working out , thanks .\nPhD C: It 's really great .\nPostdoc G: Thanks . And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data It 's sort of a {disfmarker} a little bit {disfmarker} a little bit\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nProfessor B: Super idea .\nGrad E: Yep , that 'd be very interesting .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things ,\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'd love to hear what they have to say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's a great idea .\nPhD D: So if we got them to talk about this meeting , it would be a meta {disfmarker} meta meeting .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah , exa {vocalsound} exactly I guess {disfmarker} nested several layers ,\nProfessor B: Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us\nPostdoc G: but\nProfessor B: so how do we do this , is the only thing .\nPhD C: Or just have them talk amongst themselves .\nPhD D: Have them have their own meeting .\nPhD C: And have\nPostdoc G: Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,\nProfessor B: Oh .\nPostdoc G: yeah . Have them talk about the data and they {disfmarker} and they 've made observations to me\nPhD C: that would be great .\nPostdoc G: like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , you know it 's part of it 's {disfmarker} it 's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nGrad E: Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Be great .\nProfessor B: So maybe we could {disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Give us a status .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh good . OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .\nGrad E: Great .\nGrad J: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be {disfmarker} I 'll be working on this .\nGrad E: And are you staying at Berkeley or is {disfmarker} are you just here a semester ?\nGrad J: This is my second semester and last .\nGrad E: Ah second and last ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad J: So I leave\nProfessor B: He 's in the {disfmarker} he 's in the cour two two five D course .\nGrad J: Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course ,\nProfessor B: So , yeah .\nGrad J: yeah .\nGrad E: Good .\nPhD D: Welcome .\nPostdoc G: Then you {disfmarker} then you go back to Norway , that 's OK .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nGrad F: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the {vocalsound} echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK ,\nGrad E: Digits ?\nProfessor B: let 's do digits . OK .\nGrad E: And stop .", "answers": ["Following close-talking microphone recognition procedures, it was decided that data from the far-field microphones (or PZMs) should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: So ,\nProject Manager: So , uh now {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hi Christa . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Hi Sammy . {vocalsound} It's the detail design meeting , so we're going {disfmarker} last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible\nUser Interface: And chocolate ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . {vocalsound} And that's all . Okay . So first , {vocalsound} let's uh see the prototype .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , here we have our prototype model .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you have some slides then ?\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah . Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes , and place some slides .\nProject Manager: Okay . Uh so in which uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh , participant three . {vocalsound} Prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: In {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm okay . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh , so this is our remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: Him .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and then we'll give some technical specifications .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: That's {vocalsound} well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , so that's that . Please , next slide . We analysed all the fruits\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and contacted NASA , and uh made some {vocalsound} real good {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: MASA ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that {gap} . And um , {vocalsound} s society will accept that . For sure .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the {gap} modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . And as I said , {vocalsound} it's perfect . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Please press it .\nIndustrial Designer: Experience . Explanat\nUser Interface: Everyone is {gap} f really uh really glad to obtain an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} s such a r such a device .\nMarketing: Such a nice thing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: See this {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So you can touch it with your hands .\nMarketing: Can I ?\nUser Interface: Sure . Yes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Ho-ho . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} imitating flatulence] {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do you say ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: N\nMarketing: It says {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} You must say it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Spongy .\nMarketing: I will uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} One day .\nMarketing: I'll buy it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If I if I need so . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: He {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hopefully my daughter will like it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course .\nMarketing: Yes , of course . Of c course . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and {disfmarker} That's all I wanted to say .\nMarketing: Ah .\nUser Interface: Now it's technical specification by our colleague .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh , there is {vocalsound} a button missing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons .\nMarketing: It's in option . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . So function , mm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this {vocalsound} jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . {vocalsound} Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And it can also do the action .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby {gap} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Bobby . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hey , babe .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then , {vocalsound} it will say hi . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Bob . {vocalsound} Hey Bob . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , hi , and then you can use it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay ,\nProject Manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} 'Kay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: that's good .\nIndustrial Designer: So , {vocalsound} um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can {vocalsound} have {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , these are strawberries . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Are colourful . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Material , we want to stick to titanium . {vocalsound} We will send , we want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fruit smelling spongy titanium . {vocalsound} I didn't know it exist , but that's great .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or s {vocalsound} So , we want to have {vocalsound} simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .\nMarketing: Ha .\nProject Manager: Ho-ho . That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ?\nMarketing: You mean we can change the colour uh of th\nIndustrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: With titanium it's {disfmarker} it is silver .\nMarketing: Tit titanium is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We are still working on titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: Uh , okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hey , you know you're theme today . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , Bob , please . {vocalsound} {gap} Tuesday colour . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} depending on your mood , or s\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Black for Sunday . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And you can have many colours on weekends . Or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wh wh\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nMarketing: On the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , these are like sensors .\nMarketing: Oh .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Of course .\nUser Interface: That's location sensors .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} What do you think ? {vocalsound} Strawberry sensors . {vocalsound} Very useful .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Strawberries .\nIndustrial Designer: So , {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Lounge meeting . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , and we can just {gap} some strawberry first . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright . Good . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: S\nMarketing: So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , any specific questions for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: we'll see in the financial part if uh {vocalsound} all {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} gets into {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It makes sense .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's make a party first maybe . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} W Who is the five uh {disfmarker} fifty millions we {vocalsound} first make a party in ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Then we can discuss {disfmarker} We can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So uh , this is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: What a design .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Uh , so {disfmarker} Let's uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's my turn .\nProject Manager: yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Let's see if this {disfmarker} Yeah , if you meet {vocalsound} the evaluation criterion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oops .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Fudge .\nMarketing: Yeah . So , evaluation please . So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our {disfmarker} what we want to do , and things like that . So mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , next slide , please . {vocalsound} As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . To {disfmarker} so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide ,\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ?\nIndustrial Designer: Fancy .\nMarketing: So these are the criterion uh I'm {disfmarker} I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nMarketing: So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , what's is really {disfmarker}\nMarketing: what do you think , is it fancy ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , it's really {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager: Uh what do you think ?\nMarketing: What do you think ?\nUser Interface: Feel the weight .\nMarketing: Is it {disfmarker} The weight is later .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Oh .\nUser Interface: Really . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We can give at least five or six , seven .\nMarketing: It's uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so {disfmarker} No it's it's one .\nProject Manager: It's in the other {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , {gap} Oh . So {disfmarker} Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's one or two .\nProject Manager: Two . Let's say two , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: M maybe two .\nMarketing: What do you think ? Two ?\nUser Interface: Two . Two .\nMarketing: Okay . So here , two . Up .\nIndustrial Designer: Technology .\nMarketing: Then we have uh technology .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based {gap} ,\nIndustrial Designer: And we have L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: we have L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Change colour of t\nIndustrial Designer: So you change colours .\nMarketing: Change colour , I mean that's very {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Useful .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Quite\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: d I think it's a one for that , at least .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . It's silly .\nMarketing: At least a one , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Robustness , uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , still we need to cha {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} let's suppose my daughter take it and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} and through it away .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype .\nProject Manager: The strawberries {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Let's try . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh my god . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe strawberry .\nMarketing: Okay , we just lost one strawberry .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No . How can I say this .\nMarketing: Not at all ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we can easily plug it .\nUser Interface: It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus .\nMarketing: It is {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} A strawberry .\nMarketing: So it's not so bad .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: I um uh I would say three .\nProject Manager: Yeah . But it's too {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It's um robust , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Useful ?\nMarketing: Useful . {vocalsound} Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So I don't know . These buttons are uh {disfmarker} It not clear .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah , lets me try .\nMarketing: But you have at least uh next produce .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: What is uh next , please ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh , it depends on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And you can uh do di two sites ?\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: You {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option .\nProject Manager: Okay , also .\nIndustrial Designer: So if you don't want {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , um {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: You can , by using the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: You can .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Directly .\nUser Interface: You go {disfmarker} you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: You c push here the the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , the basic mode {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down .\nMarketing: Oh , it's a jog dial , okay .\nUser Interface: Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down .\nIndustrial Designer: And channel .\nMarketing: Uh-huh . Okay .\nUser Interface: And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: You select twenty , you select five .\nIndustrial Designer: You can select .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah mm .\nMarketing: It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ?\nUser Interface: No .\nMarketing: Don't you think so ? May {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} okay , we can go . That's uh {disfmarker} You're right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: That's {disfmarker} it's less uh {disfmarker} Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So what do you think for it , usefulness ?\nIndustrial Designer: So , d Yeah , we need to address {disfmarker} we want {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Seems to be useful . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Let me understand well ,\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: because I'm not sure {disfmarker} that's for {disfmarker} that this one are b d uh two dir directional button .\nMarketing: Both . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Up .\nMarketing: Up down or left right . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . And which {disfmarker} what is that ?\nUser Interface: It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: This is jog wheel .\nMarketing: That {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay , okay . It's a kind {disfmarker} Oh , okay okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Like , selecting the menus .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Oh oh okay , great .\nMarketing: I would say then uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nProject Manager: Now it's looks us useful .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nIndustrial Designer: Two , maybe . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , two . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So size and weight .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Is it the the the effective size and weight that the {disfmarker} Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or {disfmarker} Because it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} size al almost {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Size is going to be that , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , because it is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh , and and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium .\nUser Interface: Sure ,\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nUser Interface: without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: It's going to be lighter ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Of course .\nMarketing: because this seems to be very heavy f I mean ,\nIndustrial Designer: Heavy . Yeah .\nMarketing: for my daughter , for instance .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Not sure if uh {vocalsound} she can use it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But sides {disfmarker} uh , the sides should be okay . {gap} . Yeah\nMarketing: So , should be okay .\nIndustrial Designer: mm .\nMarketing: Up to three for that ,\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nMarketing: because I'm {disfmarker} haven't seen the weight so I must not uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Colour and shape .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh {vocalsound} the case .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The case is silver titanium , no ?\nMarketing: It's a {disfmarker} it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's nice .\nProject Manager: Let's imagine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I think it's good . Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And what about the strawberries on the top ? {vocalsound} I'm not convince . {vocalsound} But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yahoo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . Yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} uh they're not useful .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I mean it {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So maybe , I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Whether it's fancy or not now , it {disfmarker} we have to decide .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But this\nProject Manager: I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful .\nMarketing: If it's {disfmarker} Uh-huh . So , that they will {disfmarker} that maybe the fruit may be here instead . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . But the n {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: So it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Even {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No , I'm not sure uh why {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: These buttons {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: uh if it was like this {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} But it looks really {vocalsound} not really good .\nProject Manager: I It's {gap} n {vocalsound} no , it's not fancy any more .\nIndustrial Designer: I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've {disfmarker} yeah we have sensors here and so here and here ,\nProject Manager: Also .\nIndustrial Designer: so we just {disfmarker} Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy . {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: I suggested three .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince ,\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nMarketing: although it's quite {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: You have good arguments .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ?\nUser Interface: Sure , sure , just look at it . {vocalsound} It's full adaptable . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Wow , that's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fully adaptable .\nUser Interface: Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know .\nMarketing: That's {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} So you can fit into your palm , okay .\nProject Manager: Yea\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: You can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: What else can we need ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's fudge titanium . {vocalsound} You know .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's fudge , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Right , yeah . {vocalsound} And uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm , {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is {disfmarker} if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Let's go for one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Now we have to do the average . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Three , three , six , eight , eleven .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who is good in math ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's two point one seven .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound} Two point one seven . That's nice . Two point one seven out of seven .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: I think we have a good good thing .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation .\nProject Manager: So it's a good evaluation .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} It seems to be good , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah mm .\nMarketing: We have uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nMarketing: Yeah . Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the {vocalsound} financial criterium ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Financi\nMarketing: Ah-ha .\nProject Manager: So , I have an {disfmarker} Here . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Energy .\nMarketing: So so how many batteries do we need ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , we use bat One battery .\nMarketing: One battery ?\nProject Manager: Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: so two .\nMarketing: Good . Why two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , we just need one , I guess .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Say no . No , ne never install .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Two batteries or one ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: No , number is one . We need only one battery .\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah ,\nMarketing: Only one .\nProject Manager: but the price is two . Oh , number .\nMarketing: No , no . But no , no . No , no way .\nProject Manager: Sorry sorry sorry . I'm sorry .\nUser Interface: No , uh you just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Number , number .\nUser Interface: Number . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah . Oh .\nMarketing: Yeah . You never use uh Excel ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , never . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: How {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Good . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: What what's the limit ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} H {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's twelve bucks .\nUser Interface: Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 'cause uh it's not my field . Twelve bucks . Okay ,\nMarketing: Twelve bucks .\nUser Interface: now {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Twelve and a half , I think .\nUser Interface: Check that number also . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So we {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound} Okay , electronics .\nIndustrial Designer: We have sample chip .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , like simple chip , yeah .\nMarketing: It's a simple chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: So , yeah .\nMarketing: Simple chip , okay . One .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Four buttons at least .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And for the {disfmarker} One also .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , one to one .\nMarketing: One or two ? One ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , one .\nMarketing: Okay . So the case , which one uh is it in the end ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , no ?\nMarketing: Let's do a single curve .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , is {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's it's flat .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Oh , okay .\nMarketing: It's flat , and curved .\nProject Manager: I thought you can curve\nUser Interface: It's flat .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} somebody . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} But it is flat ,\nMarketing: It's curvable . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: you {disfmarker} Look . It's curvable , but it's not curved . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Maybe there is a supplement for that {gap} , no ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It's only {gap} curve ?\nProject Manager: Oh see , I I think {vocalsound} that the the price is this one .\nMarketing: Okay , let's go .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This {disfmarker} Okay ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: you d {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Don't chip on me .\nMarketing: We tried , we tried .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . Titanium .\nMarketing: So , what is it ? T titanium ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: Mm , that's expensive .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-mm .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} But she wanted u the {vocalsound} fudge titanium .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Let's stick to s titan .\nProject Manager: I think it's five , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you don't say {gap} . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Special colour ?\nUser Interface: Well , n Why three ?\nIndustrial Designer: No , only one , no ?\nMarketing: No because uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Why three ?\nProject Manager: Oh , sorry . Again , I'm {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} See it .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Special colour ,\nIndustrial Designer: Interface .\nProject Manager: or it's only on the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes , in L_C_D_ display .\nProject Manager: Yeah , but {vocalsound} there is no {vocalsound} colour here .\nIndustrial Designer: Ok Yeah , an Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I put it here .\nIndustrial Designer: Push-button .\nMarketing: So the L_C_D_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: How many push-button ?\nIndustrial Designer: Scro\nProject Manager: Three or two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , two .\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: Is there {disfmarker} The scroll-wheel , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: One scroll wheel {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: It's going to be expensive . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: One L_C_D_ displayed .\nProject Manager: Okay . Um {disfmarker} That's that's not {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's all ?\nProject Manager: We choose this one , and not this one .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: No . Oh , I think , no it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's cheaper .\nMarketing: Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ?\nProject Manager: Or only a scroll-wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Only scroll wheel .\nMarketing: Or only only scroll wheel , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah mm . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You try to s {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You are trying to make make up {disfmarker} {vocalsound} make us up .\nProject Manager: No , no , no .\nIndustrial Designer: It's already {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Because {vocalsound} how do you do to {vocalsound} y select ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ah .\nMarketing: No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel\nIndustrial Designer: Y ye\nMarketing: no ? That's true .\nProject Manager: and then you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Then it automatically {disfmarker} we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Stay longer . Okay .\nMarketing: It should stay . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Oops . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um , plus , yeah , it's {disfmarker} price is really {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , okay . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Special colours , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: For buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nUser Interface: No ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , buttons and strawberries .\nUser Interface: buttons just normal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Special form .\nProject Manager: You you have all of these , no ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} She's very hard on this . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm maybe n not this one but {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Special colour ? Yeah . No . Special material ?\nUser Interface: That's for buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , we have titan\nUser Interface: But buttons are standard .\nMarketing: Yeah , buttons are the standard buttons . Yeah . It's only buttons , these .\nProject Manager: Yeah , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nothing special .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . So we are at seventeen dot eight .\nProject Manager: Not special colours an interest in ?\nMarketing: No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And buttons are not colourised ? They are m\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , hmm ,\nMarketing: I no .\nIndustrial Designer: I think uh because you can just go for a good colours .\nMarketing: We can just use this red .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Boo-hoo . {vocalsound} It's already too expensive . {vocalsound} Apparently .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So what is {disfmarker} Are we supposed to cut things out now ?\nProject Manager: Yeah . Mm .\nMarketing: Uh , until we get twelve fifty .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So think of what we can cut uh here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well , if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_\nIndustrial Designer: Sample speaker .\nMarketing: and the speaker .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy\nProject Manager: But you don't need a battery ?\nUser Interface: to make electricity . Yeah , that you don't need a battery . So , it's something like hand dynamo robot . A real high-tech version of it .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: But um\nMarketing: So that would {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: it's like the hand dynamo , no ?\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand\nMarketing: So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We we win one .\nUser Interface: Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's already that .\nProject Manager: Uh it's a it's a beginning .\nMarketing: Okay , let's do that .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Why not .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Let's do that .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} One here and here .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just remo\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nUser Interface: And I propose to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: S\nUser Interface: So uh , about chips .

Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh , so this is our remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: Him .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and then we'll give some technical specifications .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: That's {vocalsound} well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , so that's that . Please , next slide . We analysed all the fruits\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and contacted NASA , and uh made some {vocalsound} real good {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: MASA ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that {gap} . And um , {vocalsound} s society will accept that . For sure .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the {gap} modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . And as I said , {vocalsound} it's perfect . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Please press it .\nIndustrial Designer: Experience . Explanat\nUser Interface: Everyone is {gap} f really uh really glad to obtain an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} s such a r such a device .\nMarketing: Such a nice thing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: See this {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So you can touch it with your hands .\nMarketing: Can I ?\nUser Interface: Sure . Yes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Ho-ho . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} imitating flatulence] {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do you say ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: N\nMarketing: It says {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} You must say it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Spongy .\nMarketing: I will uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} One day .\nMarketing: I'll buy it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If I if I need so . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: He {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hopefully my daughter will like it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course .\nMarketing: Yes , of course . Of c course . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and {disfmarker} That's all I wanted to say .\nMarketing: Ah .\nUser Interface: Now it's technical specification by our colleague .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh , there is {vocalsound} a button missing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons .\nMarketing: It's in option . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . So function , mm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this {vocalsound} jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . {vocalsound} Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And it can also do the action .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby {gap} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Bobby . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hey , babe .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then , {vocalsound} it will say hi . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Bob . {vocalsound} Hey Bob . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , hi , and then you can use it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay ,\nProject Manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} 'Kay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: that's good .\nIndustrial Designer: So , {vocalsound} um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can {vocalsound} have {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , these are strawberries . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Are colourful . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Material , we want to stick to titanium . {vocalsound} We will send , we want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fruit smelling spongy titanium . {vocalsound} I didn't know it exist , but that's great .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or s {vocalsound} So , we want to have {vocalsound} simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .\nMarketing: Ha .\nProject Manager: Ho-ho . That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ?\nMarketing: You mean we can change the colour uh of th\nIndustrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: With titanium it's {disfmarker} it is silver .\nMarketing: Tit titanium is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We are still working on titanium .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: Uh , okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hey , you know you're theme today . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , Bob , please . {vocalsound} {gap} Tuesday colour . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} depending on your mood , or s\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Black for Sunday . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And you can have many colours on weekends . Or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wh wh\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nMarketing: On the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , these are like sensors .\nMarketing: Oh .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Of course .\nUser Interface: That's location sensors .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} What do you think ? {vocalsound} Strawberry sensors . {vocalsound} Very useful .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Strawberries .\nIndustrial Designer: So , {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Lounge meeting . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , and we can just {gap} some strawberry first . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright . Good . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: S\nMarketing: So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , any specific questions for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: we'll see in the financial part if uh {vocalsound} all {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} gets into {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It makes sense .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's make a party first maybe . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} W Who is the five uh {disfmarker} fifty millions we {vocalsound} first make a party in ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Then we can discuss {disfmarker} We can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So uh , this is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: What a design .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Uh , so {disfmarker} Let's uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's my turn .\nProject Manager: yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Let's see if this {disfmarker} Yeah , if you meet {vocalsound} the evaluation criterion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oops .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Fudge .\nMarketing: Yeah . So , evaluation please . So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our {disfmarker} what we want to do , and things like that . So mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , next slide , please . {vocalsound} As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . To {disfmarker} so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide ,\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ?\nIndustrial Designer: Fancy .\nMarketing: So these are the criterion uh I'm {disfmarker} I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nMarketing: So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , what's is really {disfmarker}\nMarketing: what do you think , is it fancy ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , it's really {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager: Uh what do you think ?\nMarketing: What do you think ?\nUser Interface: Feel the weight .\nMarketing: Is it {disfmarker} The weight is later .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Oh .\nUser Interface: Really . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We can give at least five or six , seven .\nMarketing: It's uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so {disfmarker} No it's it's one .\nProject Manager: It's in the other {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , {gap} Oh . So {disfmarker} Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So it's one or two .\nProject Manager: Two . Let's say two , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: M maybe two .\nMarketing: What do you think ? Two ?\nUser Interface: Two . Two .\nMarketing: Okay . So here , two . Up .\nIndustrial Designer: Technology .\nMarketing: Then we have uh technology .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based {gap} ,\nIndustrial Designer: And we have L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: we have L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Change colour of t\nIndustrial Designer: So you change colours .\nMarketing: Change colour , I mean that's very {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Useful .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Quite\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: d I think it's a one for that , at least .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . It's silly .\nMarketing: At least a one , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Robustness , uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , still we need to cha {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} let's suppose my daughter take it and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} and through it away .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype .\nProject Manager: The strawberries {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Let's try . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh my god . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe strawberry .\nMarketing: Okay , we just lost one strawberry .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No . How can I say this .\nMarketing: Not at all ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we can easily plug it .\nUser Interface: It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus .\nMarketing: It is {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} A strawberry .\nMarketing: So it's not so bad .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: I um uh I would say three .\nProject Manager: Yeah . But it's too {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It's um robust , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Useful ?\nMarketing: Useful . {vocalsound} Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So I don't know . These buttons are uh {disfmarker} It not clear .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah , lets me try .\nMarketing: But you have at least uh next produce .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: What is uh next , please ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh , it depends on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And you can uh do di two sites ?\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: You {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option .\nProject Manager: Okay , also .\nIndustrial Designer: So if you don't want {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , um {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: You can , by using the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: You can .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Directly .\nUser Interface: You go {disfmarker} you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: You c push here the the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , the basic mode {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down .\nMarketing: Oh , it's a jog dial , okay .\nUser Interface: Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down .\nIndustrial Designer: And channel .\nMarketing: Uh-huh . Okay .\nUser Interface: And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: You select twenty , you select five .\nIndustrial Designer: You can select .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah mm .\nMarketing: It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ?\nUser Interface: No .\nMarketing: Don't you think so ? May {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} okay , we can go . That's uh {disfmarker} You're right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: That's {disfmarker} it's less uh {disfmarker} Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So what do you think for it , usefulness ?\nIndustrial Designer: So , d Yeah , we need to address {disfmarker} we want {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Seems to be useful . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Let me understand well ,\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: because I'm not sure {disfmarker} that's for {disfmarker} that this one are b d uh two dir directional button .\nMarketing: Both . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Up .\nMarketing: Up down or left right . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . And which {disfmarker} what is that ?\nUser Interface: It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: This is jog wheel .\nMarketing: That {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay , okay . It's a kind {disfmarker} Oh , okay okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Like , selecting the menus .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Oh oh okay , great .\nMarketing: I would say then uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nProject Manager: Now it's looks us useful .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nIndustrial Designer: Two , maybe . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , two . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So size and weight .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Is it the the the effective size and weight that the {disfmarker} Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or {disfmarker} Because it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} size al almost {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Size is going to be that , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , because it is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh , and and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium .\nUser Interface: Sure ,\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nUser Interface: without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: It's going to be lighter ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Of course .\nMarketing: because this seems to be very heavy f I mean ,\nIndustrial Designer: Heavy . Yeah .\nMarketing: for my daughter , for instance .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Not sure if uh {vocalsound} she can use it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But sides {disfmarker} uh , the sides should be okay . {gap} . Yeah\nMarketing: So , should be okay .\nIndustrial Designer: mm .\nMarketing: Up to three for that ,\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nMarketing: because I'm {disfmarker} haven't seen the weight so I must not uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Colour and shape .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh {vocalsound} the case .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The case is silver titanium , no ?\nMarketing: It's a {disfmarker} it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's nice .\nProject Manager: Let's imagine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I think it's good . Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And what about the strawberries on the top ? {vocalsound} I'm not convince . {vocalsound} But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yahoo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . Yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} uh they're not useful .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I I mean it {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So maybe , I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Whether it's fancy or not now , it {disfmarker} we have to decide .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But this\nProject Manager: I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful .\nMarketing: If it's {disfmarker} Uh-huh . So , that they will {disfmarker} that maybe the fruit may be here instead . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . But the n {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: So it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Even {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No , I'm not sure uh why {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: These buttons {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: uh if it was like this {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} But it looks really {vocalsound} not really good .\nProject Manager: I It's {gap} n {vocalsound} no , it's not fancy any more .\nIndustrial Designer: I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've {disfmarker} yeah we have sensors here and so here and here ,\nProject Manager: Also .\nIndustrial Designer: so we just {disfmarker} Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy . {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: I suggested three .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince ,\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nMarketing: although it's quite {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: You have good arguments .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ?\nUser Interface: Sure , sure , just look at it . {vocalsound} It's full adaptable . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Wow , that's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fully adaptable .\nUser Interface: Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know .\nMarketing: That's {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} So you can fit into your palm , okay .\nProject Manager: Yea\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: You can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: What else can we need ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's fudge titanium . {vocalsound} You know .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's fudge , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Right , yeah . {vocalsound} And uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm , {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is {disfmarker} if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Let's go for one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Now we have to do the average . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Three , three , six , eight , eleven .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who is good in math ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's two point one seven .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound} Two point one seven . That's nice . Two point one seven out of seven .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: I think we have a good good thing .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation .\nProject Manager: So it's a good evaluation .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} It seems to be good , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah mm .\nMarketing: We have uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nMarketing: Yeah . Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the {vocalsound} financial criterium ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Financi\nMarketing: Ah-ha .\nProject Manager: So , I have an {disfmarker} Here . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Energy .\nMarketing: So so how many batteries do we need ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , we use bat One battery .\nMarketing: One battery ?\nProject Manager: Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: so two .\nMarketing: Good . Why two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , we just need one , I guess .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Say no . No , ne never install .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Two batteries or one ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: No , number is one . We need only one battery .\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah ,\nMarketing: Only one .\nProject Manager: but the price is two . Oh , number .\nMarketing: No , no . But no , no . No , no way .\nProject Manager: Sorry sorry sorry . I'm sorry .\nUser Interface: No , uh you just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Number , number .\nUser Interface: Number . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah . Oh .\nMarketing: Yeah . You never use uh Excel ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , never . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: How {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Good . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: What what's the limit ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} H {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's twelve bucks .\nUser Interface: Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 'cause uh it's not my field . Twelve bucks . Okay ,\nMarketing: Twelve bucks .\nUser Interface: now {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Twelve and a half , I think .\nUser Interface: Check that number also . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So we {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound} Okay , electronics .\nIndustrial Designer: We have sample chip .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , like simple chip , yeah .\nMarketing: It's a simple chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: So , yeah .\nMarketing: Simple chip , okay . One .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Four buttons at least .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And for the {disfmarker} One also .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , one to one .\nMarketing: One or two ? One ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , one .\nMarketing: Okay . So the case , which one uh is it in the end ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , no ?\nMarketing: Let's do a single curve .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , is {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's it's flat .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} Oh , okay .\nMarketing: It's flat , and curved .\nProject Manager: I thought you can curve\nUser Interface: It's flat .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} somebody . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} But it is flat ,\nMarketing: It's curvable . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: you {disfmarker} Look . It's curvable , but it's not curved . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Maybe there is a supplement for that {gap} , no ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It's only {gap} curve ?\nProject Manager: Oh see , I I think {vocalsound} that the the price is this one .\nMarketing: Okay , let's go .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This {disfmarker} Okay ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: you d {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Don't chip on me .\nMarketing: We tried , we tried .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . Titanium .\nMarketing: So , what is it ? T titanium ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: Mm , that's expensive .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-mm .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} But she wanted u the {vocalsound} fudge titanium .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Let's stick to s titan .\nProject Manager: I think it's five , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you don't say {gap} . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Special colour ?\nUser Interface: Well , n Why three ?\nIndustrial Designer: No , only one , no ?\nMarketing: No because uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Why three ?\nProject Manager: Oh , sorry . Again , I'm {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} See it .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Special colour ,\nIndustrial Designer: Interface .\nProject Manager: or it's only on the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes , in L_C_D_ display .\nProject Manager: Yeah , but {vocalsound} there is no {vocalsound} colour here .\nIndustrial Designer: Ok Yeah , an Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I put it here .\nIndustrial Designer: Push-button .\nMarketing: So the L_C_D_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: How many push-button ?\nIndustrial Designer: Scro\nProject Manager: Three or two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , two .\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: Is there {disfmarker} The scroll-wheel , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: One scroll wheel {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: It's going to be expensive . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: One L_C_D_ displayed .\nProject Manager: Okay . Um {disfmarker} That's that's not {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's all ?\nProject Manager: We choose this one , and not this one .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: No . Oh , I think , no it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's cheaper .\nMarketing: Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ?\nProject Manager: Or only a scroll-wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Only scroll wheel .\nMarketing: Or only only scroll wheel , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah mm . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You try to s {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You are trying to make make up {disfmarker} {vocalsound} make us up .\nProject Manager: No , no , no .\nIndustrial Designer: It's already {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Because {vocalsound} how do you do to {vocalsound} y select ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ah .\nMarketing: No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel\nIndustrial Designer: Y ye\nMarketing: no ? That's true .\nProject Manager: and then you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Then it automatically {disfmarker} we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Stay longer . Okay .\nMarketing: It should stay . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Oops . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um , plus , yeah , it's {disfmarker} price is really {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , okay . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Special colours , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: For buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nUser Interface: No ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , buttons and strawberries .\nUser Interface: buttons just normal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Special form .\nProject Manager: You you have all of these , no ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} She's very hard on this . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm maybe n not this one but {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Special colour ? Yeah . No . Special material ?\nUser Interface: That's for buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , we have titan\nUser Interface: But buttons are standard .\nMarketing: Yeah , buttons are the standard buttons . Yeah . It's only buttons , these .\nProject Manager: Yeah , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nothing special .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . So we are at seventeen dot eight .\nProject Manager: Not special colours an interest in ?\nMarketing: No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And buttons are not colourised ? They are m\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , hmm ,\nMarketing: I no .\nIndustrial Designer: I think uh because you can just go for a good colours .\nMarketing: We can just use this red .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Boo-hoo . {vocalsound} It's already too expensive . {vocalsound} Apparently .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So what is {disfmarker} Are we supposed to cut things out now ?\nProject Manager: Yeah . Mm .\nMarketing: Uh , until we get twelve fifty .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So think of what we can cut uh here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well , if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_\nIndustrial Designer: Sample speaker .\nMarketing: and the speaker .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy\nProject Manager: But you don't need a battery ?\nUser Interface: to make electricity . Yeah , that you don't need a battery . So , it's something like hand dynamo robot . A real high-tech version of it .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: But um\nMarketing: So that would {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: it's like the hand dynamo , no ?\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand\nMarketing: So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We we win one .\nUser Interface: Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's already that .\nProject Manager: Uh it's a it's a beginning .\nMarketing: Okay , let's do that .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Why not .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Let's do that .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} One here and here .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just remo\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nUser Interface: And I propose to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: S\nUser Interface: So uh , about chips . Advanced chip on print , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , put minus one there , please . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'm not sure if this is legal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's right . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Why not ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , no .\nUser Interface: And ?\nMarketing: And ?\nProject Manager: M maybe minus uh three , no ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: No . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So , was there result ?\nIndustrial Designer: No , no . It's not {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay , let's see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Mm .\nUser Interface: Let's have a look .\nIndustrial Designer: It's not changing , no ?\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: It {disfmarker} you don't\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah , if {disfmarker} Click somewhere , you'll see features .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nMarketing: Yes , it does .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Maybe put minus two , so it looks uh {vocalsound} more reasonable . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Why not .\nMarketing: Yeah , anyway {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Oh , sorry .\nUser Interface: Minus .\nMarketing: No , minus two .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Nobody will know .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's not recorded , is it ?\nUser Interface: Good .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay , we're on time .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Good .\nIndustrial Designer: So now on , we can increase our {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Still you have two more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we can use it for our party .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh .\nUser Interface: And a battery and a battery , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Both its it's cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: No , now we are exp exceeding I think .\nUser Interface: Now it's fancy ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: let's add one instead of two . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It {disfmarker} Is it ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah y\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think we're exceeding now .\nIndustrial Designer: No , but point five point three .\nMarketing: We have to remove the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Uh , it's better . I think they are counting uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Mm . It's maximum\nIndustrial Designer: Is really strict ?\nMarketing: We would prefer ,\nProject Manager: and don't have to {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: yeah . Maximum is maximum .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nMarketing: So , remove one of them . Yeah . Okay . Okay , we're uh on target .\nProject Manager: Uh , mm-mm . Yeah . Mm . Okay . Mm . So {vocalsound} target reached . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'm just curious to see this\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ho {vocalsound}\nMarketing: uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} my {disfmarker} {vocalsound} address chip on print .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's um English uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Trick {vocalsound} . Uh , I would say it's the Russian trick , but\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but uh {gap} is uh English . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No ,\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .

A good leader , you know , a good leader is somewhere in the shade and {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: but uh then I I mus That's true . And there's uh one very important point .\nIndustrial Designer: Don't really .\nMarketing: We're on time .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And we also {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Meetings finish when they have to or even before .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . We made {disfmarker} Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The {disfmarker} for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing .\nUser Interface: Of course . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay . Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Not to waste time , that's important .\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah , we have other {vocalsound} uh remote controls to create . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We need time f\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding . New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design .\nProject Manager: A lot of uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: New materials .\nMarketing: Mm . {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , uh new ways of doing financial {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm , yeah .

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I'm proud of it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It does look very cool .\nProject Manager: Um then\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager: Is that right ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Presentation .\nUser Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager: Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nMarketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and {disfmarker} like the previous one and the next one .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .\nMarketing: So where's the volume ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: The volume is is scrolling .\nIndustrial Designer: It's on the side .\nUser Interface: On the side ,\nMarketing: Ah , you did get that in then ,\nUser Interface: this one . Yeah you just do it like this .\nMarketing: mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .\nMarketing: Oh okay , {gap} .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: See ? So the volume is {vocalsound} you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , {vocalsound} okay , there there you have the screen\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and and you have the mm {vocalsound} spinning wheel with options to choose .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh no , we we'd not put {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: A mute button .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .\nUser Interface: Well , {gap} we'll have this on the screen , on the display .\nProject Manager: Y or you could have it {disfmarker} so you {disfmarker} on the wheel if you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .\nUser Interface: Well , but the but the mute {disfmarker} yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?\nProject Manager: But if you hold it in ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?\nProject Manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , okay .\nMarketing: So that {gap} that solves the whole mute issue .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .\nProject Manager: {gap} no .\nUser Interface: You can't really see it in the interface .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , very good .\nUser Interface: So I think it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nUser Interface: Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We ran out of resources here , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: In the actual one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You can have a look . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So if you have questions .\nProject Manager: Very good , let's have a look .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Test it out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .\nMarketing: Yeah , oh , we hold the remote .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But yeah , uh that's cool , cool .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then we'll there {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , see the budget .\nProject Manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and cut some of the prices that way .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wales . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Wales , for example . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fabulous ,\nProject Manager: Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer {disfmarker} prepare the evaluation of the new design . {vocalsound} Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like {disfmarker} so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool , so these are what they are . Oh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ?\nMarketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .\nProject Manager: Mm dots , never mind .\nMarketing: Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .\nMarketing: Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , just prepare one now .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: It will be red , too .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ?\nIndustrial Designer: So ?\nProject Manager: I reckon it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} S seven was th the maximum , yeah ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I I go for seven .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: Oh {vocalsound} we're all so proud of the {gap} .\nProject Manager: Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Could {disfmarker} oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .\nProject Manager: Ah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Excellent . Except we can't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we can we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But that's alright .\nProject Manager: uh we can if we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I can I can take note uh uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute .\nProject Manager: then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine .\nMarketing: Okay , so {vocalsound} we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people ,\nProject Manager: I think it does .\nUser Interface: I would think yes , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger .\nUser Interface: Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m {vocalsound} model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: But that's gonna be a problem ,\nIndustrial Designer: But then {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem ,\nMarketing: I th I think it's not {vocalsound} it's not like it's a pen .\nIndustrial Designer: because i i it is operatable .\nUser Interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so they just {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: but they can normally do most things right-handed ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: so I would say it's not such a big issue .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nMarketing: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So maybe we need to put {disfmarker} that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?\nProject Manager: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: What do you what do you all think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Six .\nUser Interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think I think for um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean most people are right-handed , so in {vocalsound} in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want {disfmarker} might want to um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: One more thing is that i\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,\nProject Manager: They {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so it opens on the side . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: No , yeah , but mm but we have it {vocalsound} nicely {vocalsound} with the hinges here {gap} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah , I mean {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it won't be a problem ,\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you guys can decide wh whether {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it will be {disfmarker} and it will be {disfmarker} it won't be heavy .\nIndustrial Designer: Oops .\nMarketing: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but we {disfmarker} which makes it kind of really big , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah well yeah ,\nProject Manager: The length is gonna be difficu\nUser Interface: but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long .\nMarketing: Yeah um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah .\nMarketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this this kind of uh makes it more {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: S uh slightly smaller .\nIndustrial Designer: and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel .\nMarketing: So you have to keep that side flat .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Um {vocalsound} okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: No , we have a locator .\nProject Manager: No , we're gonna put it like {disfmarker} we've got th there's the locator dot .\nMarketing: There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a {disfmarker} that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,\nUser Interface: Mm that you stick on T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: doesn't it ? To make it beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Or a buzzer .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some {disfmarker} to make some sounds , so {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ?\nUser Interface: Yep .\nMarketing: Fabulous . D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Intuitive , completely intuitive . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . If {vocalsound} uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and it's {disfmarker} I th I think it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I'd say six , 'cause the {disfmarker} I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .\nIndustrial Designer: Intuitive .\nMarketing: Yeah , and I mean d\nIndustrial Designer: And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni\nProject Manager: Might be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .\nProject Manager: But it {disfmarker} and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: So , should we maybe say f a five\nIndustrial Designer: So l\nMarketing: and say it is intuitive ,\nProject Manager: Five ?\nMarketing: but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I'm happy with five ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive but {disfmarker} Sorry , it's really hard to write on those .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate .\nProject Manager: Yep . But otherwise it's superb .\nMarketing: So , should we give it a six ?\nProject Manager: Six .\nMarketing: Six ?\nUser Interface: Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting .\nUser Interface: yeah ? See .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , so it's kinda {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic .\nMarketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know ,\nProject Manager: Well we've banned them from {disfmarker}\nMarketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah .\nMarketing: so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest .\nIndustrial Designer: And moreover it it has um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ and everything ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's varied .\nMarketing: Okay , so we give that a six ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Six ?\nMarketing: yeah . Okay , F_ .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} it does have {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely .\nProject Manager: Voice control have seven .\nMarketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide .\nMarketing: Oh okay , cool . Um {vocalsound} right , so {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: So it has voice control .\nMarketing: Yes , so that's a seven then .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nMarketing: Um , cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: G_ technologically innovative .\nIndustrial Designer: Anyway it ha yeah ,\nUser Interface: Technologi {gap} well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is {disfmarker} yeah , it's kind of new .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean you don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: All of the components have been used in other things before .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote .\nUser Interface: But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .\nMarketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .\nProject Manager: But do {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: What do you reckon , five , six ?\nMarketing: Yeah , what do you all think ?\nUser Interface: Six .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Six ?\nUser Interface: I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well , that's it , I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , I don't think many peop\nProject Manager: Space remote .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's it , they can take it with them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Put fashion in electronics .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: The carrot banana remote . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's the maximum fashion .\nMarketing: So , we give it seven , and we write {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: There we go .\nIndustrial Designer: I think that's a {gap} .\nUser Interface: So I think we've done very well , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} What's the assessment ?\nMarketing: So , we need the average here , so we got {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: The average is about six and something .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , one .\nUser Interface: A little bit over six .\nMarketing: Seven {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There are how many sixes ?\nProject Manager: Or a seven {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: One , two , three .\nMarketing: So we've got four sevens ,\nUser Interface: No , wait , a little bit under six .\nMarketing: so that's twenty eight ,\nIndustrial Designer: Three .\nUser Interface: No , wait .\nMarketing: three sixes ,\nIndustrial Designer: And one five .\nMarketing: eighteen .\nUser Interface: Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one .\nProject Manager: Six point point {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Fifty one divided by {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Six point something , yeah .\nMarketing: Two three four {disfmarker} Seven eight .\nProject Manager: about six point five .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Six point five , yeah .\nProject Manager: Close enough .\nMarketing: Okay , that's pretty good , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Now wait until we {vocalsound} get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?\nMarketing: Um no , that's it ,\nProject Manager: That's it ?\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright . So , finance . And we'll see if we can unscrew this first .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Cool , there we go .\nProject Manager: Sorry , this is {disfmarker} I'm just um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} . There we go and there are the marks .\nProject Manager: Beautiful .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not anymore .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Computer no signal ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit .\nProject Manager: Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: One simple battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced , yeah .\nProject Manager: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .\nUser Interface: Yep .\nProject Manager: Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yes .\nProject Manager: Case material we said rubber .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: I don't know what special colour means .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm anything uh I think which is not more {gap} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It could be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .\nProject Manager: Rub rubber comes coloured ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it's {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .\nUser Interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} yeah yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: you might end up having to take off the sample sensor .\nProject Manager: We we're definitely going to have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We have pushbuttons ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've\nUser Interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well .\nProject Manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?\nIndustrial Designer: No uh we we have uh yeah .\nUser Interface: S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And we have L_C_ display\nProject Manager: And button supplements .\nUser Interface: and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm no .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} . No .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No ?\nIndustrial Designer: we're not using any of that .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have {disfmarker} think {disfmarker} maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though ,\nUser Interface: Okay , let's {gap} yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: haven't we ?\nProject Manager: I think the pushbutton {disfmarker} oh .\nMarketing: 'Cause then you have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I don't know if that's one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget .\nProject Manager: Yeah . That seems unlikely .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nProject Manager: Push what uh\nIndustrial Designer: Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh .\nMarketing: Twelve point five .\nProject Manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We have to count all of them , or {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm I don't think so , no .\nProject Manager: I don't think that makes sense .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface ,\nMarketing: Well it doesn't , but it uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel {disfmarker} so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: And L_C_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Wh wh what's our criteria ?\nMarketing: This sample sensor {gap} .\nProject Manager: Our budget's twelve point five .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .\nProject Manager: Yeah , so that has implications though for the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . {gap} when you say {disfmarker} when you press one it says one or it says hello .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: For the locator .\nMarketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm {vocalsound} and the locator also goes away .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: We can afford to get rid of it .\nUser Interface: But it was very no innovative\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: So that means no locator , does it ?\nUser Interface: {gap} innovativeness {gap} . Well um {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: I mean does {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What else does it need ?\nUser Interface: Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .\nProject Manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing .\nUser Interface: This would be {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah yeah {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: there you record your samples your speech samples and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , okay , so we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Right , so we need one fifty off .\nMarketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} We could do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: So tha that {vocalsound} mean that we cannot press {disfmarker} how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget .\nIndustrial Designer: If {vocalsound} in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .\nUser Interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .\nMarketing: But that's {disfmarker} well you would just have to to spin it down {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: No w w w but ha\nMarketing: So that's point three .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .\nUser Interface: But I mean {vocalsound} we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: If you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's with the L_C_\nIndustrial Designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We decided , 'cause it's not on our list .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh so so the the this is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: The scroll wheel is on the side .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} . So {vocalsound} we're adding costs for {gap} right , okay uh I mean I think this is good .\nMarketing: S so we're point three over .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We're point three over at the moment .\nMarketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether\nProject Manager: It's nothing n\nMarketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . But yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nMarketing: I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up {disfmarker} for up and down .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: On the side .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Rather than having three different things that people have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses .\nMarketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve {gap} , couldn't we ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and then I'll take {disfmarker} I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Not really , no .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We {disfmarker} instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never {gap} anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer: Um yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was {disfmarker} it's not a great difference I don't think .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we lose the locator .\nProject Manager: Alright then .\nMarketing: Really ?\nProject Manager: We're gonna have a beep .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well {gap} we're going to have a beeping thing .\nIndustrial Designer: So instead of speaker , {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Cool . That's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tha\nUser Interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh the the beeper thing .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nMarketing: It {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case .\nProject Manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know , your pen vibrates ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But only for a very short time . Um okay . So looks like we've designed a banana .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well done , team . {vocalsound} Um we need {disfmarker} we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Feedback ? Ideas ?\nUser Interface: Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um we kap kept a adding things randomly .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So , had we known {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning {gap} should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , that or not , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So {vocalsound} d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , mm .\nMarketing: I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so you didn't {vocalsound} st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating {vocalsound} remote control {vocalsound} shaped like a banana ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Banana . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um yeah , so yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens .\nUser Interface: And the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh I like the pens .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We like the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s\nProject Manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah ,\nProject Manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: that's it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They great ?\nIndustrial Designer: I wonder what one of these costs . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I don't think you should say that was the recording .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh okay .\nMarketing: Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yep . Shh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the {disfmarker} I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there ,\nMarketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah . The thing flew in ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah .\nMarketing: Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} back it , {vocalsound} this is {disfmarker} just had to be changed\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: . And {disfmarker} yeah , so {disfmarker} cool .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And presumably you don't {disfmarker} you can say nasty things as well .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I have no stake in it .\nUser Interface: I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .\nProject Manager: You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll leave the room and you can have another go .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Better than that than the banana .\nUser Interface: And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .\nProject Manager: I think it worked quite well .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?\nUser Interface: To express them mm mm\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,\nUser Interface: no .\nIndustrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager: Banana remote .\nMarketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager: You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ?\nMarketing: It's in the project documents {gap} .\nProject Manager: It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nUser Interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time .\nMarketing: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .\nProject Manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We certainly are ,\nProject Manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Thank you , team .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It was very productive day and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We could draw animals on the board again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can make some animals .\nMarketing: I don't like Play-Doh , no .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , you don't like anim\nMarketing: It's just minging . It smells so bad .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't ?\nMarketing: It does .\nUser Interface: Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nIndustrial Designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\nProject Manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not .\nMarketing: No , it hasn't been .\nProject Manager: Um presumably I have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\nProject Manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\nMarketing: Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I made your animal for you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about project finance.\nAnswer:", "input": "Summarize the discussion about project finance.", "context": "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I'm proud of it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It does look very cool .\nProject Manager: Um then\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager: Is that right ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Presentation .\nUser Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager: Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nMarketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and {disfmarker} like the previous one and the next one .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .\nMarketing: So where's the volume ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: The volume is is scrolling .\nIndustrial Designer: It's on the side .\nUser Interface: On the side ,\nMarketing: Ah , you did get that in then ,\nUser Interface: this one . Yeah you just do it like this .\nMarketing: mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .\nMarketing: Oh okay , {gap} .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: See ? So the volume is {vocalsound} you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , {vocalsound} okay , there there you have the screen\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and and you have the mm {vocalsound} spinning wheel with options to choose .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh no , we we'd not put {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: A mute button .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .\nUser Interface: Well , {gap} we'll have this on the screen , on the display .\nProject Manager: Y or you could have it {disfmarker} so you {disfmarker} on the wheel if you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .\nUser Interface: Well , but the but the mute {disfmarker} yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?\nProject Manager: But if you hold it in ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?\nProject Manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , okay .\nMarketing: So that {gap} that solves the whole mute issue .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .\nProject Manager: {gap} no .\nUser Interface: You can't really see it in the interface .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , very good .\nUser Interface: So I think it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nUser Interface: Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We ran out of resources here , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: In the actual one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You can have a look . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So if you have questions .\nProject Manager: Very good , let's have a look .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Test it out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .\nMarketing: Yeah , oh , we hold the remote .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But yeah , uh that's cool , cool .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then we'll there {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , see the budget .\nProject Manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and cut some of the prices that way .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wales . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Wales , for example . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fabulous ,\nProject Manager: Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer {disfmarker} prepare the evaluation of the new design . {vocalsound} Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like {disfmarker} so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool , so these are what they are . Oh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ?\nMarketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .\nProject Manager: Mm dots , never mind .\nMarketing: Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .\nMarketing: Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , just prepare one now .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: It will be red , too .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ?\nIndustrial Designer: So ?\nProject Manager: I reckon it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} S seven was th the maximum , yeah ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I I go for seven .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: Oh {vocalsound} we're all so proud of the {gap} .\nProject Manager: Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Could {disfmarker} oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .\nProject Manager: Ah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Excellent . Except we can't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we can we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But that's alright .\nProject Manager: uh we can if we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I can I can take note uh uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute .\nProject Manager: then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine .\nMarketing: Okay , so {vocalsound} we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people ,\nProject Manager: I think it does .\nUser Interface: I would think yes , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger .\nUser Interface: Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m {vocalsound} model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: But that's gonna be a problem ,\nIndustrial Designer: But then {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem ,\nMarketing: I th I think it's not {vocalsound} it's not like it's a pen .\nIndustrial Designer: because i i it is operatable .\nUser Interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so they just {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: but they can normally do most things right-handed ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: so I would say it's not such a big issue .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nMarketing: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So maybe we need to put {disfmarker} that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?\nProject Manager: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: What do you what do you all think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Six .\nUser Interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think I think for um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean most people are right-handed , so in {vocalsound} in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want {disfmarker} might want to um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: One more thing is that i\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,\nProject Manager: They {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so it opens on the side . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: No , yeah , but mm but we have it {vocalsound} nicely {vocalsound} with the hinges here {gap} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah , I mean {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it won't be a problem ,\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you guys can decide wh whether {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it will be {disfmarker} and it will be {disfmarker} it won't be heavy .\nIndustrial Designer: Oops .\nMarketing: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but we {disfmarker} which makes it kind of really big , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah well yeah ,\nProject Manager: The length is gonna be difficu\nUser Interface: but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long .\nMarketing: Yeah um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah .\nMarketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this this kind of uh makes it more {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: S uh slightly smaller .\nIndustrial Designer: and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel .\nMarketing: So you have to keep that side flat .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Um {vocalsound} okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: No , we have a locator .\nProject Manager: No , we're gonna put it like {disfmarker} we've got th there's the locator dot .\nMarketing: There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a {disfmarker} that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,\nUser Interface: Mm that you stick on T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: doesn't it ? To make it beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Or a buzzer .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some {disfmarker} to make some sounds , so {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ?\nUser Interface: Yep .\nMarketing: Fabulous . D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Intuitive , completely intuitive . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . If {vocalsound} uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and it's {disfmarker} I th I think it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I'd say six , 'cause the {disfmarker} I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .\nIndustrial Designer: Intuitive .\nMarketing: Yeah , and I mean d\nIndustrial Designer: And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni\nProject Manager: Might be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .\nProject Manager: But it {disfmarker} and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: So , should we maybe say f a five\nIndustrial Designer: So l\nMarketing: and say it is intuitive ,\nProject Manager: Five ?\nMarketing: but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I'm happy with five ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive but {disfmarker} Sorry , it's really hard to write on those .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate .\nProject Manager: Yep . But otherwise it's superb .\nMarketing: So , should we give it a six ?\nProject Manager: Six .\nMarketing: Six ?\nUser Interface: Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting .\nUser Interface: yeah ? See .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , so it's kinda {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic .\nMarketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know ,\nProject Manager: Well we've banned them from {disfmarker}\nMarketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah .\nMarketing: so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest .\nIndustrial Designer: And moreover it it has um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ and everything ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's varied .\nMarketing: Okay , so we give that a six ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Six ?\nMarketing: yeah . Okay , F_ .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} it does have {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely .\nProject Manager: Voice control have seven .\nMarketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide .\nMarketing: Oh okay , cool . Um {vocalsound} right , so {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: So it has voice control .\nMarketing: Yes , so that's a seven then .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nMarketing: Um , cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: G_ technologically innovative .\nIndustrial Designer: Anyway it ha yeah ,\nUser Interface: Technologi {gap} well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is {disfmarker} yeah , it's kind of new .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean you don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: All of the components have been used in other things before .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote .\nUser Interface: But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .\nMarketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .\nProject Manager: But do {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: What do you reckon , five , six ?\nMarketing: Yeah , what do you all think ?\nUser Interface: Six .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Six ?\nUser Interface: I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well , that's it , I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , I don't think many peop\nProject Manager: Space remote .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's it , they can take it with them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Put fashion in electronics .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: The carrot banana remote . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's the maximum fashion .\nMarketing: So , we give it seven , and we write {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: There we go .\nIndustrial Designer: I think that's a {gap} .\nUser Interface: So I think we've done very well , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} What's the assessment ?\nMarketing: So , we need the average here , so we got {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: The average is about six and something .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , one .\nUser Interface: A little bit over six .\nMarketing: Seven {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There are how many sixes ?\nProject Manager: Or a seven {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: One , two , three .\nMarketing: So we've got four sevens ,\nUser Interface: No , wait , a little bit under six .\nMarketing: so that's twenty eight ,\nIndustrial Designer: Three .\nUser Interface: No , wait .\nMarketing: three sixes ,\nIndustrial Designer: And one five .\nMarketing: eighteen .\nUser Interface: Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one .\nProject Manager: Six point point {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Fifty one divided by {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Six point something , yeah .\nMarketing: Two three four {disfmarker} Seven eight .\nProject Manager: about six point five .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Six point five , yeah .\nProject Manager: Close enough .\nMarketing: Okay , that's pretty good , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Now wait until we {vocalsound} get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?\nMarketing: Um no , that's it ,\nProject Manager: That's it ?\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright . So , finance . And we'll see if we can unscrew this first .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Cool , there we go .\nProject Manager: Sorry , this is {disfmarker} I'm just um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} . There we go and there are the marks .\nProject Manager: Beautiful .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not anymore .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Computer no signal ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit .\nProject Manager: Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: One simple battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced , yeah .\nProject Manager: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .\nUser Interface: Yep .\nProject Manager: Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yes .\nProject Manager: Case material we said rubber .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: I don't know what special colour means .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm anything uh I think which is not more {gap} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It could be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .\nProject Manager: Rub rubber comes coloured ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it's {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .\nUser Interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} yeah yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: you might end up having to take off the sample sensor .\nProject Manager: We we're definitely going to have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We have pushbuttons ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've\nUser Interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well .\nProject Manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?\nIndustrial Designer: No uh we we have uh yeah .\nUser Interface: S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And we have L_C_ display\nProject Manager: And button supplements .\nUser Interface: and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm no .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} . No .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No ?\nIndustrial Designer: we're not using any of that .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have {disfmarker} think {disfmarker} maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though ,\nUser Interface: Okay , let's {gap} yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: haven't we ?\nProject Manager: I think the pushbutton {disfmarker} oh .\nMarketing: 'Cause then you have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I don't know if that's one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget .\nProject Manager: Yeah . That seems unlikely .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nProject Manager: Push what uh\nIndustrial Designer: Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh .\nMarketing: Twelve point five .\nProject Manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We have to count all of them , or {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm I don't think so , no .\nProject Manager: I don't think that makes sense .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface ,\nMarketing: Well it doesn't , but it uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel {disfmarker} so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: And L_C_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Wh wh what's our criteria ?\nMarketing: This sample sensor {gap} .\nProject Manager: Our budget's twelve point five .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .\nProject Manager: Yeah , so that has implications though for the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . {gap} when you say {disfmarker} when you press one it says one or it says hello .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: For the locator .\nMarketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm {vocalsound} and the locator also goes away .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: We can afford to get rid of it .\nUser Interface: But it was very no innovative\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: So that means no locator , does it ?\nUser Interface: {gap} innovativeness {gap} . Well um {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: I mean does {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What else does it need ?\nUser Interface: Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .\nProject Manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing .\nUser Interface: This would be {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah yeah {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: there you record your samples your speech samples and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , okay , so we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Right , so we need one fifty off .\nMarketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} We could do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: So tha that {vocalsound} mean that we cannot press {disfmarker} how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget .\nIndustrial Designer: If {vocalsound} in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .\nUser Interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .\nMarketing: But that's {disfmarker} well you would just have to to spin it down {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: No w w w but ha\nMarketing: So that's point three .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .\nUser Interface: But I mean {vocalsound} we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: If you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's with the L_C_\nIndustrial Designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We decided , 'cause it's not on our list .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh so so the the this is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: The scroll wheel is on the side .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} . So {vocalsound} we're adding costs for {gap} right , okay uh I mean I think this is good .\nMarketing: S so we're point three over .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We're point three over at the moment .\nMarketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether\nProject Manager: It's nothing n\nMarketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . But yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nMarketing: I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up {disfmarker} for up and down .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: On the side .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Rather than having three different things that people have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses .\nMarketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve {gap} , couldn't we ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and then I'll take {disfmarker} I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Not really , no .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We {disfmarker} instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never {gap} anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer: Um yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was {disfmarker} it's not a great difference I don't think .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we lose the locator .\nProject Manager: Alright then .\nMarketing: Really ?\nProject Manager: We're gonna have a beep .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well {gap} we're going to have a beeping thing .\nIndustrial Designer: So instead of speaker , {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Cool . That's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tha\nUser Interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh the the beeper thing .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nMarketing: It {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case .\nProject Manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know , your pen vibrates ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But only for a very short time . Um okay . So looks like we've designed a banana .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well done , team . {vocalsound} Um we need {disfmarker} we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Feedback ? Ideas ?\nUser Interface: Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um we kap kept a adding things randomly .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So , had we known {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning {gap} should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , that or not , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So {vocalsound} d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , mm .\nMarketing: I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so you didn't {vocalsound} st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating {vocalsound} remote control {vocalsound} shaped like a banana ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Banana . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um yeah , so yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens .\nUser Interface: And the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh I like the pens .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We like the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s\nProject Manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah ,\nProject Manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: that's it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They great ?\nIndustrial Designer: I wonder what one of these costs . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I don't think you should say that was the recording .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh okay .\nMarketing: Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yep . Shh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the {disfmarker} I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there ,\nMarketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah . The thing flew in ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah .\nMarketing: Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} back it , {vocalsound} this is {disfmarker} just had to be changed\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: . And {disfmarker} yeah , so {disfmarker} cool .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And presumably you don't {disfmarker} you can say nasty things as well .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I have no stake in it .\nUser Interface: I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .\nProject Manager: You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll leave the room and you can have another go .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Better than that than the banana .\nUser Interface: And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .\nProject Manager: I think it worked quite well .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?\nUser Interface: To express them mm mm\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,\nUser Interface: no .\nIndustrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager: Banana remote .\nMarketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager: You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ?\nMarketing: It's in the project documents {gap} .\nProject Manager: It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nUser Interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time .\nMarketing: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .\nProject Manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We certainly are ,\nProject Manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Thank you , team .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It was very productive day and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We could draw animals on the board again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can make some animals .\nMarketing: I don't like Play-Doh , no .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , you don't like anim\nMarketing: It's just minging . It smells so bad .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't ?\nMarketing: It does .\nUser Interface: Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nIndustrial Designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\nProject Manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not .\nMarketing: No , it hasn't been .\nProject Manager: Um presumably I have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\nProject Manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\nMarketing: Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I made your animal for you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}", "answers": ["The production cost was 12.5 Euros.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager: That's great .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: Perfect .\nProject Manager: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is {disfmarker} I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about {disfmarker} I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some {disfmarker} you know , say our {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind {disfmarker} before we launch {disfmarker} can we see how they're received ?\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker} It's an option , uh but actually there's {disfmarker} I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now\nProject Manager: Okay . Okay .\nMarketing: which actually might even come into play beforehand ,\nProject Manager: Okay , perfect .\nMarketing: it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .\nProject Manager: Great , thank you very much Nathan .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , you're welcome .\nProject Manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You waiting for me ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Fascinating , compelling even .\nMarketing: I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . {vocalsound} Right . So\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now {disfmarker} basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting {disfmarker} they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um {disfmarker} that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tomatoes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: a different shape\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or {vocalsound} okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of {disfmarker} and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I like it , I like it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: uh not something I I've come up with a {gap} though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use {disfmarker} we can use a rubber as part of the case ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Slick , slick .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nMarketing: Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new {disfmarker} I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager: Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's {disfmarker} tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause so many {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nIndustrial Designer: you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .\nMarketing: Very true . Very true .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's like , yep {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you ,\nMarketing: Very much so {vocalsound} . Um\nIndustrial Designer: you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .\nProject Manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it ?\nUser Interface: We can have a duck tape casing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We could .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It could go with the granola crowd .\nMarketing: but worth a shot .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , it could be , it could be ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Great ,\nMarketing: um . Yeah that's what I know .\nProject Manager: thanks for that Sarah .\nMarketing: No problem .\nProject Manager: Ron ?\nUser Interface: Phew . Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look .\nProject Manager: Yeah\nUser Interface: Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um {disfmarker} with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} On the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: at the {gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: right .\nMarketing: Yeah . Very true , very true .\nUser Interface: Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: which I am sure most of you know about .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern {gap} a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your {disfmarker} for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I {disfmarker} again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I can see . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , again probably not what we're going for\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so I {disfmarker} I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh {disfmarker} our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it\nMarketing: Mm , right .\nUser Interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: has jokes when it's ready .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager: Great .\nUser Interface: And uh that is about it .\nProject Manager: Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . {vocalsound} Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um {vocalsound} various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?\nMarketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . 'Kay .\nMarketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: right ?\nIndustrial Designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote ,\nProject Manager: To produce each one .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Per ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's just an estimate though .\nMarketing: Piece .\nUser Interface: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: You industrial designers . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I know .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's fun . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?\nProject Manager: Well .\nMarketing: Do we remember ?\nIndustrial Designer: I thought there was some flexibility with that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: There is , it's just , it is a question of {disfmarker} and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .\nMarketing: Can we justify it ?\nProject Manager: Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin {vocalsound} um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?\nIndustrial Designer: That's just off the top of my head ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} From the board ,\nIndustrial Designer: it is pending further emails . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: um , well {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's true , I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It is the new {disfmarker} it would be in a class of its own .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And that's {disfmarker} to be fair the um the per cent of the market {disfmarker} we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make {disfmarker} I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros ,\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh {disfmarker} on the third floor suggested that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: See if we can cut some corners .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's true .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right . It's a starting point anyway , so .\nProject Manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we {disfmarker} yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} our main selling point here .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition {disfmarker} I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} The voice rec thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , {vocalsound} if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec .\nMarketing: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house ,\nMarketing: Price-wise .\nUser Interface: I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: we're using it for our coffee machines already .\nMarketing: We've already got it .\nUser Interface: I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh {disfmarker} guy down the hall . Sounds good .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?\nIndustrial Designer: I think if we {disfmarker} we do both the {disfmarker} obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into {disfmarker} it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice .\nMarketing: Pretty much .\nUser Interface: I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .\nMarketing: Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Does having both really up our costs ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , 'cause you {disfmarker} you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .\nProject Manager: It's just impossible .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just {disfmarker} it just becomes cost prohibitive . What {disfmarker} which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?\nMarketing: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .\nIndustrial Designer: I would have to side with that ,\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the {disfmarker} all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well my p {vocalsound} is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nathan ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would {disfmarker} they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: we're not gonna have to do as much design work\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .\nProject Manager: Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment .\nMarketing: And we're still not {disfmarker} then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: we can stick with what we've already got . In a lot other ways too .\nProject Manager: Okay . So I'm getting {disfmarker} alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay .\nMarketing: I think it's our lower risk option\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: which for right now {disfmarker} we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .\nProject Manager: Okay . Sorted .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .\nUser Interface: It's you and me outside a little here . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's {disfmarker} you guys's next step right ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it {disfmarker} what {vocalsound} f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ?\nProject Manager: Yes . We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement ,\nProject Manager: Mm . Yep .\nMarketing: like what if {disfmarker} wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light ,\nUser Interface: Calculator .\nMarketing: Yeah . True . True .\nIndustrial Designer: um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: What do you think Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?\nUser Interface: Just a thought .\nIndustrial Designer: What's the uh idea ?\nUser Interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .\nMarketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Do you think people that are {disfmarker} people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .\nMarketing: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,\nProject Manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well .\nMarketing: right .\nProject Manager: But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have {disfmarker} or like um {vocalsound} who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well .\nMarketing: With the bu yeah .\nProject Manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , I think you're on to something\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is {disfmarker} would be good , even though {disfmarker} and hand-held the same time .\nMarketing: True . Way to go .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things .\nMarketing: Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: you know like that little pod looking thing ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , those are nice .\nUser Interface: Exactly .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I mean a nice {disfmarker} although we do um wh uh is {disfmarker} I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: and get back to it\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh {disfmarker} using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: um you know\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit {disfmarker} gives just a bit . You know\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Just kind of the squishy feel .\nMarketing: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it {disfmarker} literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good .\nMarketing: Handy .\nProject Manager: Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , {vocalsound} um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We'll have more of an idea when the prototype {disfmarker} have more of a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and I'm just having to guess .\nProject Manager: we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . {vocalsound} Um , so\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we {disfmarker} wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um {vocalsound} a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .\nMarketing: Mm . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Like maybe have menu things .\nMarketing: Take precedence ,\nIndustrial Designer: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out\nMarketing: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .\nMarketing: And they slide .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah\nMarketing: True ,\nProject Manager: we've also got the the me the thing of ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: we're still not making it easier then .\nProject Manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: B But no I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why did Industrial Design agree with the Marketing when discussing their presentations on the appearance design?\nAnswer:", "input": "Why did Industrial Design agree with the Marketing when discussing their presentations on the appearance design?", "context": "Marketing: {vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager: That's great .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: Perfect .\nProject Manager: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is {disfmarker} I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about {disfmarker} I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some {disfmarker} you know , say our {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind {disfmarker} before we launch {disfmarker} can we see how they're received ?\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker} It's an option , uh but actually there's {disfmarker} I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now\nProject Manager: Okay . Okay .\nMarketing: which actually might even come into play beforehand ,\nProject Manager: Okay , perfect .\nMarketing: it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .\nProject Manager: Great , thank you very much Nathan .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , you're welcome .\nProject Manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You waiting for me ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Fascinating , compelling even .\nMarketing: I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . {vocalsound} Right . So\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now {disfmarker} basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting {disfmarker} they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um {disfmarker} that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tomatoes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: a different shape\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or {vocalsound} okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of {disfmarker} and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I like it , I like it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: uh not something I I've come up with a {gap} though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use {disfmarker} we can use a rubber as part of the case ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Slick , slick .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nMarketing: Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new {disfmarker} I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager: Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's {disfmarker} tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause so many {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nIndustrial Designer: you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .\nMarketing: Very true . Very true .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's like , yep {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you ,\nMarketing: Very much so {vocalsound} . Um\nIndustrial Designer: you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .\nProject Manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it ?\nUser Interface: We can have a duck tape casing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We could .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It could go with the granola crowd .\nMarketing: but worth a shot .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , it could be , it could be ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Great ,\nMarketing: um . Yeah that's what I know .\nProject Manager: thanks for that Sarah .\nMarketing: No problem .\nProject Manager: Ron ?\nUser Interface: Phew . Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look .\nProject Manager: Yeah\nUser Interface: Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um {disfmarker} with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} On the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: at the {gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: right .\nMarketing: Yeah . Very true , very true .\nUser Interface: Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: which I am sure most of you know about .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern {gap} a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your {disfmarker} for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I {disfmarker} again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I can see . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , again probably not what we're going for\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so I {disfmarker} I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh {disfmarker} our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it\nMarketing: Mm , right .\nUser Interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: has jokes when it's ready .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager: Great .\nUser Interface: And uh that is about it .\nProject Manager: Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . {vocalsound} Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um {vocalsound} various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?\nMarketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . 'Kay .\nMarketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: right ?\nIndustrial Designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote ,\nProject Manager: To produce each one .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Per ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's just an estimate though .\nMarketing: Piece .\nUser Interface: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: You industrial designers . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I know .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's fun . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?\nProject Manager: Well .\nMarketing: Do we remember ?\nIndustrial Designer: I thought there was some flexibility with that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: There is , it's just , it is a question of {disfmarker} and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .\nMarketing: Can we justify it ?\nProject Manager: Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin {vocalsound} um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?\nIndustrial Designer: That's just off the top of my head ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} From the board ,\nIndustrial Designer: it is pending further emails . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: um , well {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's true , I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It is the new {disfmarker} it would be in a class of its own .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And that's {disfmarker} to be fair the um the per cent of the market {disfmarker} we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make {disfmarker} I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros ,\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh {disfmarker} on the third floor suggested that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: See if we can cut some corners .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's true .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right . It's a starting point anyway , so .\nProject Manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we {disfmarker} yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} our main selling point here .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition {disfmarker} I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} The voice rec thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , {vocalsound} if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec .\nMarketing: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house ,\nMarketing: Price-wise .\nUser Interface: I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: we're using it for our coffee machines already .\nMarketing: We've already got it .\nUser Interface: I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh {disfmarker} guy down the hall . Sounds good .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?\nIndustrial Designer: I think if we {disfmarker} we do both the {disfmarker} obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into {disfmarker} it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice .\nMarketing: Pretty much .\nUser Interface: I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .\nMarketing: Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Does having both really up our costs ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , 'cause you {disfmarker} you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .\nProject Manager: It's just impossible .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just {disfmarker} it just becomes cost prohibitive . What {disfmarker} which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?\nMarketing: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .\nIndustrial Designer: I would have to side with that ,\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the {disfmarker} all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well my p {vocalsound} is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nathan ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would {disfmarker} they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: we're not gonna have to do as much design work\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .\nProject Manager: Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment .\nMarketing: And we're still not {disfmarker} then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: we can stick with what we've already got . In a lot other ways too .\nProject Manager: Okay . So I'm getting {disfmarker} alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay .\nMarketing: I think it's our lower risk option\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: which for right now {disfmarker} we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .\nProject Manager: Okay . Sorted .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .\nUser Interface: It's you and me outside a little here . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's {disfmarker} you guys's next step right ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it {disfmarker} what {vocalsound} f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ?\nProject Manager: Yes . We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement ,\nProject Manager: Mm . Yep .\nMarketing: like what if {disfmarker} wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light ,\nUser Interface: Calculator .\nMarketing: Yeah . True . True .\nIndustrial Designer: um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: What do you think Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?\nUser Interface: Just a thought .\nIndustrial Designer: What's the uh idea ?\nUser Interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .\nMarketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Do you think people that are {disfmarker} people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .\nMarketing: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,\nProject Manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well .\nMarketing: right .\nProject Manager: But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have {disfmarker} or like um {vocalsound} who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well .\nMarketing: With the bu yeah .\nProject Manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , I think you're on to something\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is {disfmarker} would be good , even though {disfmarker} and hand-held the same time .\nMarketing: True . Way to go .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things .\nMarketing: Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: you know like that little pod looking thing ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , those are nice .\nUser Interface: Exactly .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I mean a nice {disfmarker} although we do um wh uh is {disfmarker} I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: and get back to it\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh {disfmarker} using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: um you know\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit {disfmarker} gives just a bit . You know\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Just kind of the squishy feel .\nMarketing: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it {disfmarker} literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good .\nMarketing: Handy .\nProject Manager: Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , {vocalsound} um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We'll have more of an idea when the prototype {disfmarker} have more of a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and I'm just having to guess .\nProject Manager: we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . {vocalsound} Um , so\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we {disfmarker} wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um {vocalsound} a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .\nMarketing: Mm . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Like maybe have menu things .\nMarketing: Take precedence ,\nIndustrial Designer: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out\nMarketing: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .\nMarketing: And they slide .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah\nMarketing: True ,\nProject Manager: we've also got the the me the thing of ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: we're still not making it easier then .\nProject Manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: B But no I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .", "answers": ["While discussing their presentations on the appearance design, both the Industrial Design and the Marketing put forward to use rubber as the material rather than other things like wood.

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I'm proud of it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It does look very cool .\nProject Manager: Um then\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager: Is that right ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Presentation .\nUser Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager: Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nMarketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and {disfmarker} like the previous one and the next one .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .\nMarketing: So where's the volume ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: The volume is is scrolling .\nIndustrial Designer: It's on the side .\nUser Interface: On the side ,\nMarketing: Ah , you did get that in then ,\nUser Interface: this one . Yeah you just do it like this .\nMarketing: mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .\nMarketing: Oh okay , {gap} .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: See ? So the volume is {vocalsound} you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , {vocalsound} okay , there there you have the screen\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and and you have the mm {vocalsound} spinning wheel with options to choose .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh no , we we'd not put {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: A mute button .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .\nUser Interface: Well , {gap} we'll have this on the screen , on the display .\nProject Manager: Y or you could have it {disfmarker} so you {disfmarker} on the wheel if you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .\nUser Interface: Well , but the but the mute {disfmarker} yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?\nProject Manager: But if you hold it in ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?\nProject Manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , okay .\nMarketing: So that {gap} that solves the whole mute issue .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .\nProject Manager: {gap} no .\nUser Interface: You can't really see it in the interface .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , very good .\nUser Interface: So I think it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nUser Interface: Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We ran out of resources here , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: In the actual one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You can have a look . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So if you have questions .\nProject Manager: Very good , let's have a look .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Test it out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .\nMarketing: Yeah , oh , we hold the remote .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But yeah , uh that's cool , cool .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then we'll there {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , see the budget .\nProject Manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and cut some of the prices that way .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wales . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Wales , for example . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fabulous ,\nProject Manager: Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer {disfmarker} prepare the evaluation of the new design . {vocalsound} Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like {disfmarker} so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool , so these are what they are . Oh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ?\nMarketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .\nProject Manager: Mm dots , never mind .\nMarketing: Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .\nMarketing: Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , just prepare one now .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: It will be red , too .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ?\nIndustrial Designer: So ?\nProject Manager: I reckon it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} S seven was th the maximum , yeah ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I I go for seven .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: Oh {vocalsound} we're all so proud of the {gap} .\nProject Manager: Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Could {disfmarker} oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .\nProject Manager: Ah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Excellent . Except we can't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we can we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But that's alright .\nProject Manager: uh we can if we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I can I can take note uh uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute .\nProject Manager: then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine .\nMarketing: Okay , so {vocalsound} we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people ,\nProject Manager: I think it does .\nUser Interface: I would think yes , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger .\nUser Interface: Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m {vocalsound} model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: But that's gonna be a problem ,\nIndustrial Designer: But then {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem ,\nMarketing: I th I think it's not {vocalsound} it's not like it's a pen .\nIndustrial Designer: because i i it is operatable .\nUser Interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so they just {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: but they can normally do most things right-handed ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: so I would say it's not such a big issue .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nMarketing: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So maybe we need to put {disfmarker} that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?\nProject Manager: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: What do you what do you all think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Six .\nUser Interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think I think for um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean most people are right-handed , so in {vocalsound} in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want {disfmarker} might want to um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: One more thing is that i\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,\nProject Manager: They {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so it opens on the side . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: No , yeah , but mm but we have it {vocalsound} nicely {vocalsound} with the hinges here {gap} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah , I mean {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it won't be a problem ,\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you guys can decide wh whether {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it will be {disfmarker} and it will be {disfmarker} it won't be heavy .\nIndustrial Designer: Oops .\nMarketing: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but we {disfmarker} which makes it kind of really big , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah well yeah ,\nProject Manager: The length is gonna be difficu\nUser Interface: but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long .\nMarketing: Yeah um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah .\nMarketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this this kind of uh makes it more {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: S uh slightly smaller .\nIndustrial Designer: and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel .\nMarketing: So you have to keep that side flat .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Um {vocalsound} okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: No , we have a locator .\nProject Manager: No , we're gonna put it like {disfmarker} we've got th there's the locator dot .\nMarketing: There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a {disfmarker} that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,\nUser Interface: Mm that you stick on T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: doesn't it ? To make it beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Or a buzzer .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some {disfmarker} to make some sounds , so {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ?\nUser Interface: Yep .\nMarketing: Fabulous . D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Intuitive , completely intuitive . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . If {vocalsound} uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and it's {disfmarker} I th I think it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I'd say six , 'cause the {disfmarker} I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .\nIndustrial Designer: Intuitive .\nMarketing: Yeah , and I mean d\nIndustrial Designer: And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni\nProject Manager: Might be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .\nProject Manager: But it {disfmarker} and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: So , should we maybe say f a five\nIndustrial Designer: So l\nMarketing: and say it is intuitive ,\nProject Manager: Five ?\nMarketing: but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I'm happy with five ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive but {disfmarker} Sorry , it's really hard to write on those .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate .\nProject Manager: Yep . But otherwise it's superb .\nMarketing: So , should we give it a six ?\nProject Manager: Six .\nMarketing: Six ?\nUser Interface: Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting .\nUser Interface: yeah ? See .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , so it's kinda {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic .\nMarketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know ,\nProject Manager: Well we've banned them from {disfmarker}\nMarketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah .\nMarketing: so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest .\nIndustrial Designer: And moreover it it has um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ and everything ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's varied .\nMarketing: Okay , so we give that a six ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Six ?\nMarketing: yeah . Okay , F_ .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} it does have {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely .\nProject Manager: Voice control have seven .\nMarketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide .\nMarketing: Oh okay , cool . Um {vocalsound} right , so {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: So it has voice control .\nMarketing: Yes , so that's a seven then .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nMarketing: Um , cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: G_ technologically innovative .\nIndustrial Designer: Anyway it ha yeah ,\nUser Interface: Technologi {gap} well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is {disfmarker} yeah , it's kind of new .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean you don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: All of the components have been used in other things before .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote .\nUser Interface: But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .\nMarketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .\nProject Manager: But do {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: What do you reckon , five , six ?\nMarketing: Yeah , what do you all think ?\nUser Interface: Six .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Six ?\nUser Interface: I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well , that's it , I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , I don't think many peop\nProject Manager: Space remote .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's it , they can take it with them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Put fashion in electronics .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: The carrot banana remote . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's the maximum fashion .\nMarketing: So , we give it seven , and we write {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: There we go .\nIndustrial Designer: I think that's a {gap} .\nUser Interface: So I think we've done very well , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} What's the assessment ?\nMarketing: So , we need the average here , so we got {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: The average is about six and something .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , one .\nUser Interface: A little bit over six .\nMarketing: Seven {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There are how many sixes ?\nProject Manager: Or a seven {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: One , two , three .\nMarketing: So we've got four sevens ,\nUser Interface: No , wait , a little bit under six .\nMarketing: so that's twenty eight ,\nIndustrial Designer: Three .\nUser Interface: No , wait .\nMarketing: three sixes ,\nIndustrial Designer: And one five .\nMarketing: eighteen .\nUser Interface: Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one .\nProject Manager: Six point point {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Fifty one divided by {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Six point something , yeah .\nMarketing: Two three four {disfmarker} Seven eight .\nProject Manager: about six point five .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Six point five , yeah .\nProject Manager: Close enough .\nMarketing: Okay , that's pretty good , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Now wait until we {vocalsound} get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?\nMarketing: Um no , that's it ,\nProject Manager: That's it ?\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright . So , finance . And we'll see if we can unscrew this first .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Cool , there we go .\nProject Manager: Sorry , this is {disfmarker} I'm just um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} . There we go and there are the marks .\nProject Manager: Beautiful .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not anymore .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Computer no signal ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit .\nProject Manager: Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: One simple battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced , yeah .\nProject Manager: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .\nUser Interface: Yep .\nProject Manager: Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yes .\nProject Manager: Case material we said rubber .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: I don't know what special colour means .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm anything uh I think which is not more {gap} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It could be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .\nProject Manager: Rub rubber comes coloured ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it's {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .\nUser Interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} yeah yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: you might end up having to take off the sample sensor .\nProject Manager: We we're definitely going to have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We have pushbuttons ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've\nUser Interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well .\nProject Manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?\nIndustrial Designer: No uh we we have uh yeah .\nUser Interface: S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And we have L_C_ display\nProject Manager: And button supplements .\nUser Interface: and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm no .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} . No .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No ?\nIndustrial Designer: we're not using any of that .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have {disfmarker} think {disfmarker} maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though ,\nUser Interface: Okay , let's {gap} yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: haven't we ?\nProject Manager: I think the pushbutton {disfmarker} oh .\nMarketing: 'Cause then you have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I don't know if that's one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget .\nProject Manager: Yeah . That seems unlikely .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nProject Manager: Push what uh\nIndustrial Designer: Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh .\nMarketing: Twelve point five .\nProject Manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We have to count all of them , or {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm I don't think so , no .\nProject Manager: I don't think that makes sense .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface ,\nMarketing: Well it doesn't , but it uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel {disfmarker} so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: And L_C_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Wh wh what's our criteria ?\nMarketing: This sample sensor {gap} .\nProject Manager: Our budget's twelve point five .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .\nProject Manager: Yeah , so that has implications though for the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . {gap} when you say {disfmarker} when you press one it says one or it says hello .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: For the locator .\nMarketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm {vocalsound} and the locator also goes away .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: We can afford to get rid of it .\nUser Interface: But it was very no innovative\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: So that means no locator , does it ?\nUser Interface: {gap} innovativeness {gap} . Well um {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: I mean does {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What else does it need ?\nUser Interface: Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .\nProject Manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing .\nUser Interface: This would be {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah yeah {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: there you record your samples your speech samples and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , okay , so we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Right , so we need one fifty off .\nMarketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} We could do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: So tha that {vocalsound} mean that we cannot press {disfmarker} how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget .\nIndustrial Designer: If {vocalsound} in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .\nUser Interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .\nMarketing: But that's {disfmarker} well you would just have to to spin it down {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: No w w w but ha\nMarketing: So that's point three .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .\nUser Interface: But I mean {vocalsound} we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: If you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's with the L_C_\nIndustrial Designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We decided , 'cause it's not on our list .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh so so the the this is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: The scroll wheel is on the side .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} . So {vocalsound} we're adding costs for {gap} right , okay uh I mean I think this is good .\nMarketing: S so we're point three over .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We're point three over at the moment .\nMarketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether\nProject Manager: It's nothing n\nMarketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . But yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nMarketing: I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up {disfmarker} for up and down .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: On the side .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Rather than having three different things that people have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses .\nMarketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve {gap} , couldn't we ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and then I'll take {disfmarker} I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Not really , no .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We {disfmarker} instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never {gap} anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer: Um yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was {disfmarker} it's not a great difference I don't think .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we lose the locator .\nProject Manager: Alright then .\nMarketing: Really ?\nProject Manager: We're gonna have a beep .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well {gap} we're going to have a beeping thing .\nIndustrial Designer: So instead of speaker , {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Cool . That's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tha\nUser Interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh the the beeper thing .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nMarketing: It {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case .\nProject Manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know , your pen vibrates ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But only for a very short time . Um okay . So looks like we've designed a banana .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well done , team . {vocalsound} Um we need {disfmarker} we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Feedback ? Ideas ?\nUser Interface: Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um we kap kept a adding things randomly .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So , had we known {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning {gap} should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , that or not , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So {vocalsound} d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , mm .\nMarketing: I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so you didn't {vocalsound} st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating {vocalsound} remote control {vocalsound} shaped like a banana ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Banana . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um yeah , so yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens .\nUser Interface: And the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh I like the pens .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We like the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s\nProject Manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah ,\nProject Manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: that's it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They great ?\nIndustrial Designer: I wonder what one of these costs . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I don't think you should say that was the recording .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh okay .\nMarketing: Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yep . Shh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the {disfmarker} I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there ,\nMarketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah . The thing flew in ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah .\nMarketing: Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} back it , {vocalsound} this is {disfmarker} just had to be changed\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: . And {disfmarker} yeah , so {disfmarker} cool .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And presumably you don't {disfmarker} you can say nasty things as well .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I have no stake in it .\nUser Interface: I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .\nProject Manager: You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll leave the room and you can have another go .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Better than that than the banana .\nUser Interface: And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .\nProject Manager: I think it worked quite well .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?\nUser Interface: To express them mm mm\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,\nUser Interface: no .\nIndustrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager: Banana remote .\nMarketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager: You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ?\nMarketing: It's in the project documents {gap} .\nProject Manager: It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nUser Interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time .\nMarketing: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .\nProject Manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We certainly are ,\nProject Manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Thank you , team .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It was very productive day and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We could draw animals on the board again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can make some animals .\nMarketing: I don't like Play-Doh , no .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , you don't like anim\nMarketing: It's just minging . It smells so bad .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't ?\nMarketing: It does .\nUser Interface: Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nIndustrial Designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\nProject Manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not .\nMarketing: No , it hasn't been .\nProject Manager: Um presumably I have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\nProject Manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\nMarketing: Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I made your animal for you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Why did Project Manager agree with Marketing when assessing the criteria of matching the operating behaviour of the user?\nAnswer:", "input": "Why did Project Manager agree with Marketing when assessing the criteria of matching the operating behaviour of the user?", "context": "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I'm proud of it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It does look very cool .\nProject Manager: Um then\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager: Is that right ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Presentation .\nUser Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager: Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nMarketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and {disfmarker} like the previous one and the next one .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .\nMarketing: So where's the volume ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: The volume is is scrolling .\nIndustrial Designer: It's on the side .\nUser Interface: On the side ,\nMarketing: Ah , you did get that in then ,\nUser Interface: this one . Yeah you just do it like this .\nMarketing: mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .\nMarketing: Oh okay , {gap} .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: See ? So the volume is {vocalsound} you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , {vocalsound} okay , there there you have the screen\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and and you have the mm {vocalsound} spinning wheel with options to choose .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh no , we we'd not put {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: A mute button .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .\nUser Interface: Well , {gap} we'll have this on the screen , on the display .\nProject Manager: Y or you could have it {disfmarker} so you {disfmarker} on the wheel if you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .\nUser Interface: Well , but the but the mute {disfmarker} yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?\nProject Manager: But if you hold it in ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?\nProject Manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , okay .\nMarketing: So that {gap} that solves the whole mute issue .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .\nProject Manager: {gap} no .\nUser Interface: You can't really see it in the interface .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere .\nUser Interface: Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , very good .\nUser Interface: So I think it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nUser Interface: Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We ran out of resources here , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: In the actual one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You can have a look . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So if you have questions .\nProject Manager: Very good , let's have a look .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Test it out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .\nMarketing: Yeah , oh , we hold the remote .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But yeah , uh that's cool , cool .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then we'll there {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , see the budget .\nProject Manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and cut some of the prices that way .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wales . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Wales , for example . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fabulous ,\nProject Manager: Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer {disfmarker} prepare the evaluation of the new design . {vocalsound} Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like {disfmarker} so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool , so these are what they are . Oh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ?\nMarketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .\nProject Manager: Mm dots , never mind .\nMarketing: Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .\nMarketing: Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , just prepare one now .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: It will be red , too .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ?\nIndustrial Designer: So ?\nProject Manager: I reckon it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} S seven was th the maximum , yeah ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I I go for seven .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: Oh {vocalsound} we're all so proud of the {gap} .\nProject Manager: Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Could {disfmarker} oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .\nProject Manager: Ah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Excellent . Except we can't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we can we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But that's alright .\nProject Manager: uh we can if we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I can I can take note uh uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute .\nProject Manager: then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine .\nMarketing: Okay , so {vocalsound} we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people ,\nProject Manager: I think it does .\nUser Interface: I would think yes , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger .\nUser Interface: Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m {vocalsound} model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: But that's gonna be a problem ,\nIndustrial Designer: But then {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem ,\nMarketing: I th I think it's not {vocalsound} it's not like it's a pen .\nIndustrial Designer: because i i it is operatable .\nUser Interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so they just {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: but they can normally do most things right-handed ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: so I would say it's not such a big issue .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nMarketing: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So maybe we need to put {disfmarker} that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?\nProject Manager: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: What do you what do you all think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Six .\nUser Interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think I think for um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean most people are right-handed , so in {vocalsound} in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want {disfmarker} might want to um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: One more thing is that i\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,\nProject Manager: They {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so it opens on the side . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: No , yeah , but mm but we have it {vocalsound} nicely {vocalsound} with the hinges here {gap} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah , I mean {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So it won't be a problem ,\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you guys can decide wh whether {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it will be {disfmarker} and it will be {disfmarker} it won't be heavy .\nIndustrial Designer: Oops .\nMarketing: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but we {disfmarker} which makes it kind of really big , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah well yeah ,\nProject Manager: The length is gonna be difficu\nUser Interface: but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long .\nMarketing: Yeah um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah .\nMarketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this this kind of uh makes it more {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: S uh slightly smaller .\nIndustrial Designer: and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel .\nMarketing: So you have to keep that side flat .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Um {vocalsound} okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: No , we have a locator .\nProject Manager: No , we're gonna put it like {disfmarker} we've got th there's the locator dot .\nMarketing: There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a {disfmarker} that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,\nUser Interface: Mm that you stick on T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: doesn't it ? To make it beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Or a buzzer .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some {disfmarker} to make some sounds , so {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ?\nUser Interface: Yep .\nMarketing: Fabulous . D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Intuitive , completely intuitive . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . If {vocalsound} uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and it's {disfmarker} I th I think it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I'd say six , 'cause the {disfmarker} I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .\nIndustrial Designer: Intuitive .\nMarketing: Yeah , and I mean d\nIndustrial Designer: And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni\nProject Manager: Might be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .\nProject Manager: But it {disfmarker} and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: So , should we maybe say f a five\nIndustrial Designer: So l\nMarketing: and say it is intuitive ,\nProject Manager: Five ?\nMarketing: but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I'm happy with five ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive but {disfmarker} Sorry , it's really hard to write on those .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate .\nProject Manager: Yep . But otherwise it's superb .\nMarketing: So , should we give it a six ?\nProject Manager: Six .\nMarketing: Six ?\nUser Interface: Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting .\nUser Interface: yeah ? See .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , so it's kinda {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic .\nMarketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know ,\nProject Manager: Well we've banned them from {disfmarker}\nMarketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah .\nMarketing: so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest .\nIndustrial Designer: And moreover it it has um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ and everything ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's varied .\nMarketing: Okay , so we give that a six ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Six ?\nMarketing: yeah . Okay , F_ .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} it does have {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely .\nProject Manager: Voice control have seven .\nMarketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide .\nMarketing: Oh okay , cool . Um {vocalsound} right , so {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: So it has voice control .\nMarketing: Yes , so that's a seven then .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nMarketing: Um , cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: G_ technologically innovative .\nIndustrial Designer: Anyway it ha yeah ,\nUser Interface: Technologi {gap} well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is {disfmarker} yeah , it's kind of new .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean you don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: All of the components have been used in other things before .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote .\nUser Interface: But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .\nMarketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .\nProject Manager: But do {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: What do you reckon , five , six ?\nMarketing: Yeah , what do you all think ?\nUser Interface: Six .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Six ?\nUser Interface: I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well , that's it , I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , I don't think many peop\nProject Manager: Space remote .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's it , they can take it with them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Put fashion in electronics .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: The carrot banana remote . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's the maximum fashion .\nMarketing: So , we give it seven , and we write {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: There we go .\nIndustrial Designer: I think that's a {gap} .\nUser Interface: So I think we've done very well , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} What's the assessment ?\nMarketing: So , we need the average here , so we got {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: The average is about six and something .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , one .\nUser Interface: A little bit over six .\nMarketing: Seven {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There are how many sixes ?\nProject Manager: Or a seven {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: One , two , three .\nMarketing: So we've got four sevens ,\nUser Interface: No , wait , a little bit under six .\nMarketing: so that's twenty eight ,\nIndustrial Designer: Three .\nUser Interface: No , wait .\nMarketing: three sixes ,\nIndustrial Designer: And one five .\nMarketing: eighteen .\nUser Interface: Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one .\nProject Manager: Six point point {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Fifty one divided by {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Six point something , yeah .\nMarketing: Two three four {disfmarker} Seven eight .\nProject Manager: about six point five .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Six point five , yeah .\nProject Manager: Close enough .\nMarketing: Okay , that's pretty good , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Now wait until we {vocalsound} get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?\nMarketing: Um no , that's it ,\nProject Manager: That's it ?\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright . So , finance . And we'll see if we can unscrew this first .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Cool , there we go .\nProject Manager: Sorry , this is {disfmarker} I'm just um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} . There we go and there are the marks .\nProject Manager: Beautiful .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Not anymore .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Computer no signal ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit .\nProject Manager: Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: One simple battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced , yeah .\nProject Manager: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .\nUser Interface: Yep .\nProject Manager: Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yes .\nProject Manager: Case material we said rubber .\nUser Interface: Rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: I don't know what special colour means .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm anything uh I think which is not more {gap} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It could be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .\nProject Manager: Rub rubber comes coloured ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it's {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .\nUser Interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} yeah yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: you might end up having to take off the sample sensor .\nProject Manager: We we're definitely going to have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We have pushbuttons ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've\nUser Interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well .\nProject Manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?\nIndustrial Designer: No uh we we have uh yeah .\nUser Interface: S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: And we have L_C_ display\nProject Manager: And button supplements .\nUser Interface: and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm no .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} . No .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No ?\nIndustrial Designer: we're not using any of that .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have {disfmarker} think {disfmarker} maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though ,\nUser Interface: Okay , let's {gap} yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: haven't we ?\nProject Manager: I think the pushbutton {disfmarker} oh .\nMarketing: 'Cause then you have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I don't know if that's one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget .\nProject Manager: Yeah . That seems unlikely .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nProject Manager: Push what uh\nIndustrial Designer: Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh .\nMarketing: Twelve point five .\nProject Manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: We have to count all of them , or {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm I don't think so , no .\nProject Manager: I don't think that makes sense .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface ,\nMarketing: Well it doesn't , but it uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel {disfmarker} so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: And L_C_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Wh wh what's our criteria ?\nMarketing: This sample sensor {gap} .\nProject Manager: Our budget's twelve point five .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .\nProject Manager: Yeah , so that has implications though for the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . {gap} when you say {disfmarker} when you press one it says one or it says hello .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: For the locator .\nMarketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm {vocalsound} and the locator also goes away .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: We can afford to get rid of it .\nUser Interface: But it was very no innovative\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: So that means no locator , does it ?\nUser Interface: {gap} innovativeness {gap} . Well um {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: I mean does {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What else does it need ?\nUser Interface: Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .\nProject Manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing .\nUser Interface: This would be {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah yeah {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: there you record your samples your speech samples and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , okay , so we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Right , so we need one fifty off .\nMarketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} We could do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: So tha that {vocalsound} mean that we cannot press {disfmarker} how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget .\nIndustrial Designer: If {vocalsound} in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .\nUser Interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .\nMarketing: But that's {disfmarker} well you would just have to to spin it down {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: No w w w but ha\nMarketing: So that's point three .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .\nUser Interface: But I mean {vocalsound} we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: If you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's with the L_C_\nIndustrial Designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We decided , 'cause it's not on our list .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh so so the the this is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: The scroll wheel is on the side .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} . So {vocalsound} we're adding costs for {gap} right , okay uh I mean I think this is good .\nMarketing: S so we're point three over .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We're point three over at the moment .\nMarketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether\nProject Manager: It's nothing n\nMarketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . But yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nMarketing: I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up {disfmarker} for up and down .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: On the side .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Rather than having three different things that people have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses .\nMarketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve {gap} , couldn't we ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and then I'll take {disfmarker} I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Not really , no .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We {disfmarker} instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never {gap} anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer: Um yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was {disfmarker} it's not a great difference I don't think .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we lose the locator .\nProject Manager: Alright then .\nMarketing: Really ?\nProject Manager: We're gonna have a beep .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well {gap} we're going to have a beeping thing .\nIndustrial Designer: So instead of speaker , {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Cool . That's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tha\nUser Interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh the the beeper thing .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nMarketing: It {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case .\nProject Manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know , your pen vibrates ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But only for a very short time . Um okay . So looks like we've designed a banana .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well done , team . {vocalsound} Um we need {disfmarker} we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Feedback ? Ideas ?\nUser Interface: Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um we kap kept a adding things randomly .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So , had we known {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning {gap} should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , that or not , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So {vocalsound} d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , mm .\nMarketing: I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so you didn't {vocalsound} st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating {vocalsound} remote control {vocalsound} shaped like a banana ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Banana . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um yeah , so yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens .\nUser Interface: And the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh I like the pens .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We like the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s\nProject Manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah ,\nProject Manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: that's it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They great ?\nIndustrial Designer: I wonder what one of these costs . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I don't think you should say that was the recording .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh okay .\nMarketing: Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yep . Shh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the {disfmarker} I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there ,\nMarketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah . The thing flew in ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah .\nMarketing: Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} back it , {vocalsound} this is {disfmarker} just had to be changed\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: . And {disfmarker} yeah , so {disfmarker} cool .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And presumably you don't {disfmarker} you can say nasty things as well .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I have no stake in it .\nUser Interface: I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .\nProject Manager: You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll leave the room and you can have another go .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Better than that than the banana .\nUser Interface: And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .\nProject Manager: I think it worked quite well .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?\nUser Interface: To express them mm mm\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,\nUser Interface: no .\nIndustrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface: Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager: Banana remote .\nMarketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager: You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ?\nMarketing: It's in the project documents {gap} .\nProject Manager: It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nUser Interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time .\nMarketing: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .\nProject Manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We certainly are ,\nProject Manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Thank you , team .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It was very productive day and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We could draw animals on the board again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You can make some animals .\nMarketing: I don't like Play-Doh , no .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , you don't like anim\nMarketing: It's just minging . It smells so bad .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't ?\nMarketing: It does .\nUser Interface: Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nIndustrial Designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\nProject Manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not .\nMarketing: No , it hasn't been .\nProject Manager: Um presumably I have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\nProject Manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\nMarketing: Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I made your animal for you .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}", "answers": ["Industrial Designer mentioned that they were considering that the remote was more for right-handed people than for left-handed people.
