{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nAdam's apple\nThe laryngeal prominence (commonly referred to as Adam's apple), a feature of the human neck, is the lump or protrusion that is formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx.\n\nStructure\n\nThe structure of the laryngeal prominence forms a bump under the skin. It is larger in adult men, in whom it is usually clearly visible and palpable. In women, the bump is much less visible and is hardly perceived on the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. \n\nThe meeting point of the two portions of the cartilage generally forms an acute angle (of about 90\u00b0) in men, while in women it forms an open arc (of about 120\u00b0).\n\nSex difference\n\nAlthough both sexes have it, the Adam's apple is considered to be a characteristic feature of adult men, because its size tends to increase considerably during puberty. \n\nIts development is considered a secondary sexual characteristic of males that appears as a result of hormonal activity. Its level of development varies among individuals and the widening of that area in the larynx can occur very suddenly and quickly.\n\nThe laryngeal prominence is more prominent in adult males than in females because of the difference in the size of the angle: 90\u00b0 in males and 120\u00b0 in females.\n\nFunction \n\nThe Adam's apple, in conjunction with the thyroid cartilage which forms it, helps to protect the walls and the frontal part of the larynx, including the vocal cords (which are located directly behind it). It is found in both women and men.\n\nAnother function of the laryngeal prominence is related to the deepening of the voice. During adolescence, the thyroid cartilage grows together with the larynx. Consequently, the laryngeal prominence grows in size mainly in men. Together, a larger soundboard is made up in phonation apparatus and, as a result, the man gets a deeper voice note.  \n\nSociety and culture\n\nCosmetic surgery to reduce the size of laryngeal prominence is called chondrolaryngoplasty (thyroid chondroplasty).  The surgery is effective, such that complications tend to be few and, if present, transient. \n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThere are two main theories as to the origin of the term \"Adam's apple\". \nThe \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" and the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary point at an ancient belief that a piece of forbidden fruit was embedded in Adam's throat (the first man, according to Abrahamic religions).  However, neither the Bible nor other Judeo-Christian Islamic writings mention such a story. In fact, the biblical story does not even specify the type of fruit that Adam ate. \n\nLinguist Alexander Gode claimed that the Latin phrase to designate the laryngeal prominence was very probably translated incorrectly from the beginning. The phrase in Latin was \"pomum Adami\" (literally: 'Adam's apple'). This, in turn, came from the Hebrew \"tappuach ha adam\" meaning \"apple of man\". The confusion lies in the fact that in Hebrew language the proper name \"Adam\" (\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd) literally means \"man\", while the late Hebrew word used to refer  \"bump\" is very similar to the word used to refer \"apple\".   Proponents of this version contend that the subsequent phrases in Latin and other Romance languages represent a mistranslation from the start. \n\nThe medical term \"prominentia laryngea\" was introduced by the Basle Nomina Anatomica in 1895. \n\nIn the American South, goozle is used colloquially to describe the Adam's apple, likely derived from guzzle.    \n\nAdditional images\n\nFile:Slide9lll.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nFile:Slide5mmm.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nFile:Slide7ooo.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nQuestion:\nWhat is the common name for the laryngeal prominence in the body?\nAnswer:\nAdams Apple\nPassage:\nUranophobia\nFear of heaven, also known by its Greek-derived name uranophobia or ouranophobia, is a phobia that makes its sufferer fear heaven or the sky. \n\nThe origin of the word urano is Greek, meaning heaven, while phobia is Greek for fear.\n\nCauses\n\nThe causes of Uranophobia, as with other phobias, can be linked to a combination of external events and internal susceptibility - of brain chemistry and life experiences.\n\nFear of heaven may more specifically be related to the dread of punishment in the afterlife.

The work was scored for a small chamber orchestra and was performed in 1917.\n\nAs El sombrero de tres picos\n\nSergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes, saw the premiere of El corregidor y la molinera and commissioned Falla to rewrite it. The outcome was a two-act ballet scored for large orchestra called The Three-Cornered Hat (El sombrero de tres picos). This was first performed in London at the Alhambra Theatre on 22 July 1919. Sets and costumes were created by Pablo Picasso. Choreography was by L\u00e9onide Massine. Diaghilev asked Falla to conduct the premiere but the composer felt he was not experienced enough to conduct a work so complex and he handed the baton to Ernest Ansermet after one rehearsal. \nSynopsis \n\nAct One \n\nAfter a short fanfare the curtain rises revealing a mill in Andalusia. The miller is trying to teach a pet blackbird to tell the time. He tells the bird to chirp twice, but instead it chirps three times. Annoyed, the miller scolds the bird and tells it to try again. The  bird now chirps four times. The miller gets angry at the bird again and his wife offers it a grape. The bird takes the grape and chirps twice. The miller and his wife laugh over this and continue their work. \n\nSoon the magistrate, his wife, and their bodyguard pass by, taking their daily walk. The procession goes by and the couple returns to their work. The dandified, but lecherous, magistrate is heard coming back. The miller tells his wife that he will hide and that they will play a trick on the magistrate. \n\nThe miller hides and the magistrate sees the miller's wife dancing. After her dance she offers him some grapes. When the magistrate gets the grapes the miller's wife runs away with the magistrate following her. Finally he catches her, and the miller jumps out of a bush with a stick. The miller chases the magistrate away and the miller and his wife continue working.\n\nAct Two \n\nThat night, guests are at the miller's house. The miller dances to entertain them. His dance is interrupted by the magistrate's bodyguard, who has come to arrest him on trumped-up charges. After the miller is taken away, the guests leave one by one. The miller's wife goes to sleep and soon the magistrate comes to the mill. On his way to the door the magistrate trips and falls in the river. The miller's wife wakes up and runs away. \n\nThe magistrate undresses and hangs his clothes on a tree and goes to sleep in the miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison and sees the magistrate in his bed. The miller thinks that the magistrate is sleeping with his wife and plans to switch clothes with the magistrate and avenge himself by seducing the magistrate's wife. The miller leaves, dressed as the magistrate, and the magistrate soon wakes up. He goes outside and sees that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes. The bodyguard comes and sees the magistrate dressed as the miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller comes back and sees his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. The magistrate explains the entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing the magistrate up and down in a blanket.\n\nThe Music \n\nThroughout the ballet Falla uses traditional Andalusian folk music. The two songs sung by the mezzo-soprano are examples of cante jondo singing; this typically accompanies flamenco music and tells a sad story. At one point he quotes the opening of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. \n\nRecordings \n\nThere are many recordings of the complete ballet, as well as of the suites extracted from it. In the early 1960s Ernest Ansermet, the original conductor of the work, recorded it in stereo for London Records (aka Decca). The music was played by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the cante-jondo soloist was Teresa Berganza. It has also been recorded by such conductors as Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos, and Leonard Bernstein has recorded the two suites from the ballet with the New York Philharmonic.\n\nThe original pantomime El corregidor y la molinera has been recorded by Josep Pons and Orquestra del Teatro Lliure for Harmonia Mundi.\n\nFilm versions \n\nThe Paris Opera Ballet has recently issued a performance of the complete ballet on a DVD entitled Picasso and Dance. The performance uses not only Massine's original choreography, but actual reproductions of Picasso's sets and costumes. It is, so far, the only performance of the ballet issued on video.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the music for the ballet 'The Three-Cornered Hat'?\nAnswer:\nManuel de Fallas\nPassage:\nArctic Circle\nThe Arctic Circle is the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic, and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone. North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon); this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Circle.\n\nThe position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed; as of , it runs  north of the Equator.  Its latitude depends on the Earth's axial tilt, which fluctuates within a margin of 2\u00b0 over a 40,000-year period, due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon.  Consequently, the Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about 15 m per year.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe word \"arctic\" comes from the Greek word \u1f00\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (arktikos: \"near the Bear, northern\")  and that from the word \u1f04\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (arktos: \"bear\").  The name refers either to the constellation Ursa Major, the \"Great Bear\", which is prominent in the northern portion of the celestial sphere, or to the constellation Ursa Minor, the \"Little Bear\", which contains Polaris, the Pole star, also known as the North Star. \n\nMidnight sun and polar night\n\nThe Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for twenty-four hours; as a result, at least once each year at any location within the Arctic Circle the sun is visible at local midnight, and at least once it is not visible at local noon.  \n\nDirectly on the Arctic Circle these events occur, in principle, exactly once per year: at the June and December solstices, respectively. However, because of atmospheric refraction and mirages, and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50 minutes (\u2032) (90 km) south of the Arctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the northern winter solstice, part of the sun may be seen up to about 50\u2032 north of the Arctic Circle. That is true at sea level; those limits increase with elevation above sea level, although in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the true horizon.\n\nHuman habitation\n\nRelatively few people live north of the Arctic Circle due to the severe climate; nonetheless, some areas have been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. Tens of thousands of years ago, waves of people migrated from eastern Siberia across the Bering Strait into North America and gradually eastward to settle. Much later, in the historic period, there has been migration into some Arctic areas by Europeans and other immigrants.\n\nThe largest communities north of the Arctic Circle are situated in Russia and Norway: Murmansk (population 307,257), Norilsk (175,365), Troms\u00f8 (71,295) and Vorkuta (70,548). Rovaniemi (61,329) in Finland is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic Circle lying slightly south of the line.\n\nIn contrast, the largest North American community north of the Arctic Circle, Sisimiut (Greenland), has approximately 5,000 inhabitants. Of the Canadian and United States Arctic communities, Barrow, Alaska is the largest settlement with about 4,000 inhabitants.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Arctic Circle is roughly  long.  (A different source says . ) The area north of the Circle is about  and covers roughly 4% of Earth's surface. \n\nThe Arctic Circle passes through the Arctic Ocean, the Scandinavian Peninsula, North Asia, Northern America and Greenland. The land within the Arctic Circle is divided among eight countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland (where it passes through the small offshore island of Gr\u00edmsey).\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long. In the interior, summers can be quite warm, while winters are extremely cold. For example, summer temperatures in Norilsk (Russia) will sometimes reach as high as 30 C, while the winter temperatures frequently fall below .\n\nSites along the Arctic Circle\n\nStarting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards, the Arctic Circle passes through:\nQuestion:\nWhich is the largest city within the Arctic Circle?\nAnswer:\nMurmansk\nPassage:\nWhat a Country!\nWhat a Country! is an American sitcom that aired in syndication from September 27, 1986 to May 23, 1987.

The outcome was a two-act ballet scored for large orchestra called The Three-Cornered Hat (El sombrero de tres picos). This was first performed in London at the Alhambra Theatre on 22 July 1919. Sets and costumes were created by Pablo Picasso. Choreography was by L\u00e9onide Massine. Diaghilev asked Falla to conduct the premiere but the composer felt he was not experienced enough to conduct a work so complex and he handed the baton to Ernest Ansermet after one rehearsal. \nSynopsis \n\nAct One \n\nAfter a short fanfare the curtain rises revealing a mill in Andalusia. The miller is trying to teach a pet blackbird to tell the time. He tells the bird to chirp twice, but instead it chirps three times. Annoyed, the miller scolds the bird and tells it to try again. The  bird now chirps four times. The miller gets angry at the bird again and his wife offers it a grape. The bird takes the grape and chirps twice. The miller and his wife laugh over this and continue their work. \n\nSoon the magistrate, his wife, and their bodyguard pass by, taking their daily walk. The procession goes by and the couple returns to their work. The dandified, but lecherous, magistrate is heard coming back. The miller tells his wife that he will hide and that they will play a trick on the magistrate. \n\nThe miller hides and the magistrate sees the miller's wife dancing. After her dance she offers him some grapes. When the magistrate gets the grapes the miller's wife runs away with the magistrate following her. Finally he catches her, and the miller jumps out of a bush with a stick. The miller chases the magistrate away and the miller and his wife continue working.\n\nAct Two \n\nThat night, guests are at the miller's house. The miller dances to entertain them. His dance is interrupted by the magistrate's bodyguard, who has come to arrest him on trumped-up charges. After the miller is taken away, the guests leave one by one. The miller's wife goes to sleep and soon the magistrate comes to the mill. On his way to the door the magistrate trips and falls in the river. The miller's wife wakes up and runs away. \n\nThe magistrate undresses and hangs his clothes on a tree and goes to sleep in the miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison and sees the magistrate in his bed. The miller thinks that the magistrate is sleeping with his wife and plans to switch clothes with the magistrate and avenge himself by seducing the magistrate's wife. The miller leaves, dressed as the magistrate, and the magistrate soon wakes up. He goes outside and sees that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes. The bodyguard comes and sees the magistrate dressed as the miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller comes back and sees his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. The magistrate explains the entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing the magistrate up and down in a blanket.\n\nThe Music \n\nThroughout the ballet Falla uses traditional Andalusian folk music. The two songs sung by the mezzo-soprano are examples of cante jondo singing; this typically accompanies flamenco music and tells a sad story. At one point he quotes the opening of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. \n\nRecordings \n\nThere are many recordings of the complete ballet, as well as of the suites extracted from it. In the early 1960s Ernest Ansermet, the original conductor of the work, recorded it in stereo for London Records (aka Decca). The music was played by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the cante-jondo soloist was Teresa Berganza. It has also been recorded by such conductors as Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos, and Leonard Bernstein has recorded the two suites from the ballet with the New York Philharmonic.\n\nThe original pantomime El corregidor y la molinera has been recorded by Josep Pons and Orquestra del Teatro Lliure for Harmonia Mundi.\n\nFilm versions \n\nThe Paris Opera Ballet has recently issued a performance of the complete ballet on a DVD entitled Picasso and Dance. The performance uses not only Massine's original choreography, but actual reproductions of Picasso's sets and costumes. It is, so far, the only performance of the ballet issued on video.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the music for the ballet 'The Three-Cornered Hat'?\nAnswer:\nManuel de Fallas\nPassage:\nArctic Circle\nThe Arctic Circle is the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic, and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone. North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon); this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Circle.\n\nThe position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed; as of , it runs  north of the Equator.  Its latitude depends on the Earth's axial tilt, which fluctuates within a margin of 2\u00b0 over a 40,000-year period, due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon.  Consequently, the Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about 15 m per year.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe word \"arctic\" comes from the Greek word \u1f00\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (arktikos: \"near the Bear, northern\")  and that from the word \u1f04\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (arktos: \"bear\").  The name refers either to the constellation Ursa Major, the \"Great Bear\", which is prominent in the northern portion of the celestial sphere, or to the constellation Ursa Minor, the \"Little Bear\", which contains Polaris, the Pole star, also known as the North Star. \n\nMidnight sun and polar night\n\nThe Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for twenty-four hours; as a result, at least once each year at any location within the Arctic Circle the sun is visible at local midnight, and at least once it is not visible at local noon.  \n\nDirectly on the Arctic Circle these events occur, in principle, exactly once per year: at the June and December solstices, respectively. However, because of atmospheric refraction and mirages, and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50 minutes (\u2032) (90 km) south of the Arctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the northern winter solstice, part of the sun may be seen up to about 50\u2032 north of the Arctic Circle. That is true at sea level; those limits increase with elevation above sea level, although in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the true horizon.\n\nHuman habitation\n\nRelatively few people live north of the Arctic Circle due to the severe climate; nonetheless, some areas have been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. Tens of thousands of years ago, waves of people migrated from eastern Siberia across the Bering Strait into North America and gradually eastward to settle. Much later, in the historic period, there has been migration into some Arctic areas by Europeans and other immigrants.\n\nThe largest communities north of the Arctic Circle are situated in Russia and Norway: Murmansk (population 307,257), Norilsk (175,365), Troms\u00f8 (71,295) and Vorkuta (70,548). Rovaniemi (61,329) in Finland is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic Circle lying slightly south of the line.\n\nIn contrast, the largest North American community north of the Arctic Circle, Sisimiut (Greenland), has approximately 5,000 inhabitants. Of the Canadian and United States Arctic communities, Barrow, Alaska is the largest settlement with about 4,000 inhabitants.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Arctic Circle is roughly  long.  (A different source says . ) The area north of the Circle is about  and covers roughly 4% of Earth's surface. \n\nThe Arctic Circle passes through the Arctic Ocean, the Scandinavian Peninsula, North Asia, Northern America and Greenland. The land within the Arctic Circle is divided among eight countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland (where it passes through the small offshore island of Gr\u00edmsey).\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long. In the interior, summers can be quite warm, while winters are extremely cold. For example, summer temperatures in Norilsk (Russia) will sometimes reach as high as 30 C, while the winter temperatures frequently fall below .\n\nSites along the Arctic Circle\n\nStarting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards, the Arctic Circle passes through:\nQuestion:\nWhich is the largest city within the Arctic Circle?\nAnswer:\nMurmansk\nPassage:\nWhat a Country!\nWhat a Country! is an American sitcom that aired in syndication from September 27, 1986 to May 23, 1987.

It was in his Menlo Park laboratory that Thomas Edison invented both the phonograph and a commercially viable incandescent light bulb filament. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first street in the world to use electric lights for illumination.  The Menlo Park lab has been called one of the greatest laboratories ever.  Edison left Menlo Park and moved his home and laboratory to West Orange in 1887.  After his death, the Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum was constructed near his old Menlo Park lab and dedicated in 1938.

The author of works like The Raven and the The Black Cat was found in a confused state on the streets of Baltimore in October 1849 and died in a city hospital a few days later at the age of 40.\nA life-size replica of Poe's body went on display in a pine casket at the Poe House in Baltimore on October 7 for visitors to pay their respects, according to Jeff Jerome, curator of the Poe Museum.\n\"This actually is the bicentennial of Poe's birth and there was very little we could do with the birth so we thought we would recreate Poe's funeral since his original funeral was very quick.

It began broadcasting in June 1940 during World War II, with the intention of helping the war effort. It was perceived that the productivity of manual labour could be raised by offering a non-stop medley of popular music played at an even tempo, to accompany the working day in factories. For a certain period, a recorded version was rebroadcast in the late evening, to entertain night-shift workers. After the war, the broadcasts continued on the newly-formed BBC Light Programme.\nMusic While You Work was discontinued in 1967 when most Light Programme offerings were transitioned to BBC Radio 2. However, it was revived in the 1980s; initially for one week to mark the BBC's 60th anniversary in October 1982 and then as a regular part of the Radio 2 schedules from January 1983 to January 1984\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWhich radio programme used 'Calling All Workers' as its theme tune?\nAnswer:\nMusic While You Work\nPassage:\nPhlebitis\nPhlebitis or venitis is the inflammation of a vein, usually in the legs. It most commonly occurs in superficial veins. Phlebitis often occurs in conjunction with thrombosis and is then called \"thrombophlebitis\" or \"superficial thrombophlebitis\". Unlike deep vein thrombosis, the probability that superficial thrombophlebitis will cause a clot to break up and be transported in pieces to the lung is very low. \n\nSigns and symptoms\n\n* Localized redness and swelling\n* Pain or burning along the length of the vein \n* Vein being hard and cord-like \n\nCause\n\nPhlebitis is typically caused by local trauma to a vein, usually from the insertion of an intravenous catheter.  However, phlebitis can also occur due to a complication of connective tissue disorders such as lupus, or of pancreatic, breast, or ovarian cancers. Phlebitis can also result from certain medications and drugs that irritate the veins, such as desomorphine. \n\nSuperficial phlebitis often presents as an early sign in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), a vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins in distal extremities often associated with cigarette smoking. \n\nManagement\n\nTreatment usually consists of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and local compression (e.g., by compression stockings or a compress).

During 2007, he played an unexpected role in the international arbitration hearing that eventually decided American cyclist Floyd Landis should forfeit his 2006 Tour de France title due to testing that found abnormally high levels of testosterone. LeMond testified that he had spoken with Landis after his \"A\" urine sample had tested positive, urging him that if his \"B\" sample was also positive, he should come clean, help his sport, and \"more importantly, help himself.\" Before his testimony, LeMond had been threatened by Landis' manager.\nThe doping problem has been most public in the Tour de France - two stage winners of the 2007 Tour withdrew from the race amid doping allegations - but its influence is so pervasive that T-Mobile recently withdrew its sponsorship of a professional cycling team, stating that the company did not want to associate its brand with doping. - Santa Clara University\nGreg LeMond is a former professional road bicycle racer from the United States and a three time winner of the Tour de France in 1986, 1989, and 1990.\nGwen Knapp is a staff writer for the sports section of the San Francisco Chronicle.\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWith which sport would you associate Greg Le Mond?\nAnswer:\nCyclist\nPassage:\nPiculet\nThe piculets are a distinctive subfamily of small woodpeckers which occur mainly in tropical South America, with just three Asian and one African  species.\n\nLike the true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues which they use to extract their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, but they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.\n\nTheir bills are shorter and less dagger-like than  the true woodpeckers, so they look for insects and grubs mainly in decaying wood. Similarly, they re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.\n\nTypically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.\n\nSystematics and evolution\n\nAlthough not well known from fossils, the evolution of piculets is now considered rather straightforward. The disjunct occurrence of the genera, with one African species of the Southeast Asian Sasia and one Southeast Asian species of the American Picumnus is of comparatively recent origin. Molecular dating, calibrated with geographic events in the absence of a good fossil record, points at the Late Miocene, c. 8 MYA, as the point where the two genera divided into their two respective lineages. At that time, there was a notable global cooling period. The molecular distances between piculets and woodpeckers are comparatively small for subfamilies, agreeing with the hypothesis that the split between the three groups of woodpecker-like picids subfamilies occurred only during the Miocene climate optimum, around 15 MYA. The later radiation of South American piculets is probably due to changes in topology and climate fluctuations during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The genus Verreauxia may be accepted because of pronounced morphological similarities, but the two Picumnus lineages, despite having diverged long ago, are virtually alike except for head coloration (Fuchs et al., 2006).\n\nThe Antillean piculet (Nesoctites micromegas) has proven to be a very distinct species evolutionarily between piculets and woodpeckers (Benz et al., 2006) and thus is nowadays placed in a subfamily of its own.\n\nThe arrangement of species in the genera follows del Hoyo et al. (2002).\n\nGenus Picumnus\n* Speckled piculet,  Picumnus innominatus (sometimes Vivia)\n* Bar-breasted piculet,  Picumnus aurifrons\n* Orinoco piculet,  Picumnus pumilus\n* Lafresnaye's piculet,  Picumnus lafresnayi\n* Golden-spangled piculet,  Picumnus exilis\n* Black-spotted piculet,  Picumnus nigropunctatus\n* Ecuadorian piculet,  Picumnus sclateri\n* Scaled piculet,  Picumnus squamulatus\n* White-bellied piculet,  Picumnus spilogaster\n* Arrowhead piculet,  Picumnus minutissimus\n* Spotted piculet,  Picumnus pygmaeus\n* Speckle-chested piculet,  Picumnus steindachneri\n* Varzea piculet,  Picumnus varzeae\n* White-barred piculet,  Picumnus cirratus\n* Ocellated piculet,  Picumnus dorbygnianus\n* Ochre-collared piculet,  Picumnus temminckii\n* White-wedged piculet,  Picumnus albosquamatus\n* Rusty-necked piculet,  Picumnus fuscus\n* Rufous-breasted piculet,  Picumnus rufiventris\n* Tawny piculet,  Picumnus fulvescens\n* Ochraceous piculet,  Picumnus limae\n* Mottled piculet,  Picumnus nebulosus\n* Plain-breasted piculet,  Picumnus castelnau\n* Fine-barred piculet,  Picumnus subtilis\n* Olivaceous piculet,  Picumnus olivaceus\n* Greyish piculet,  Picumnus granadensis\n* Chestnut piculet,  Picumnus cinnamomeus\n\nGenus Verreauxia (sometimes included in Sasia)\n* African piculet,  Verreauxia africana\n\nGenus Sasia\n* Rufous piculet,  Sasia abnormis\n* White-browed piculet,  Sasia ochracea\nQuestion:\nA piculet is which type of creature?\nAnswer:\nAvians\nPassage:\nLoch Ness\nLoch Ness (; ,) is a large, deep, freshwater loch in the Scottish Highlands extending for approximately 37 km southwest of Inverness. Its surface is 52 ft above sea level. Loch Ness is best known for alleged sightings of the cryptozoological Loch Ness Monster, also known affectionately as \"Nessie\". It is connected at the southern end by the River Oich and a section of the Caledonian Canal to Loch Oich. At the northern end there is the Bona Narrows which opens out into Loch Dochfour, which feeds the River Ness and a further section of canal to Inverness. It is one of a series of interconnected, murky bodies of water in Scotland; its water visibility is exceptionally low due to a high peat content in the surrounding soil.\n\nLoch Ness is the second largest Scottish loch by surface area at 56 sqkm after Loch Lomond, but due to its great depth, it is the largest by volume in the British Isles. Its deepest point is 755 ft,   making it the second deepest loch in Scotland after Loch Morar. A 2016 survey claimed to have discovered a crevice that pushed the depth to 889 ft but further research determined it to be a sonar anomaly.    It contains more fresh water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined, and is the largest body of water on the Great Glen Fault, which runs from Inverness in the north to Fort William in the south.\n\nVillages and places\n\nAt Drumnadrochit is the \"Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition\"  which examines the natural history and legend of Loch Ness. Boat cruises operate from various locations on the loch shore, giving visitors the chance to look for the \"monster\".\n\nUrquhart Castle is located on the western shore, 1 mi east of Drumnadrochit.\n\nLighthouses are located at Lochend (Bona Lighthouse) and Fort Augustus.\n\nMonster\n\nLoch Ness is thought by some to be the home of the Loch Ness Monster (also known as \"Nessie\"), a cryptid, reputedly a large unknown animal. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. Popular interest and belief in the animal's existence has varied since it was first brought to the world's attention in 1933. \n\nFish species\n\nThe following fish species are native to Loch Ness. A number of others such as perch and roach have been introduced in the Loch or Caledonian Canal with various levels of success. \n\nIsland \n\nThe only island on Loch Ness is Cherry Island, visible at its southwestern end, near Fort Augustus. It is a crannog, which is a form of artificial island. Most crannogs were constructed during the Iron Age.\n\nThere was formerly a second island (Dog Island) which was submerged when the water level was raised during the construction of the Caledonian Canal.\n\nHydroelectricity\n\nLoch Ness serves as the lower storage reservoir for the Foyers pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme, which was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The turbines were originally used to provide power for a nearby aluminium smelting plant, but now electricity is generated and supplied to the National Grid. Another scheme, the 100 MW Glendoe Hydro Scheme near Fort Augustus, began generation in June 2009 producing 76 gigawatt hours in its first months of operation, It was out of service between 2009 and 2012 for repair of the tunnels connecting the reservoir to the turbines \n\nGeology\n\nLoch Ness lies along the Great Glen Fault, which forms a line of weakness in the rocks which has been excavated by glacial erosion, forming the Great Glen and the basins of Loch Lochy, Loch Oich and Loch Ness. \n\nImage gallery\n\nImage:Wt9 schleuse3 augustus locks.jpg|Locks on Caledonian Canal in Fort Augustus, Loch Ness in the background\nImage:Loch Ness 0406.JPG|Loch Ness looking south, taken in May 2006.\nImage:Loch_Ness_Panorama.png|Sunrise over Loch Ness, taken at Urquhart Castle\nImage:Loch_Ness_Panoramin_July_2008.JPG|Loch Ness panorama from a ship in 2008\n\nLoch Ness records\n\nJohn Cobb died in an attempt at the water speed record when his boat Crusader struck an unexplained wake on the surface of the loch in 1952. His accident was recorded by the BBC reporters on site at the time.  Nearby, there is a memorial to him erected by the people of Glenurquhart\n\nOn 31 August 1974, David Scott Munro, of Ross-shire Caberfeidh Water Ski Club, became the first person in the world to water ski (mono ski) the length of Loch Ness. From Lochend to Fort Augustus and back, he covered the 48 miles in 77 minutes at an average speed of 37 mph. \n\nBrenda Sherratt was the first person to swim  along the length of Loch Ness in Scotland in 31 hours and 27 minutes in July 1966.\nQuestion:\nWhich canal joins Loch Ness to the Moray Firth\nAnswer:\nCaledonian Canal Commissioners\nPassage:\nPishon\nThe Pishon ( P\u00ee\u0161\u014dn) is one of four rivers (along with Hiddekel (Tigris), Phrath (Euphrates) and Gihon) mentioned in the Biblical Book of Genesis. In that passage, these rivers are described as arising within the Garden of Eden. The Pishon is described as encircling \"the entire land of Havilah.\" \n\nIdentification \n\nUnlike the Tigris and the Euphrates, the Pishon has never been clearly located. It is briefly mentioned together with the Tigris in the Wisdom of Sirach (24:25), but this reference throws no more light on the location of the river. The Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus, in the beginning of his Antiquities of the Jews (1st century AD) identified the Pishon with the Ganges.  The medieval French rabbi Rashi identified it with the Nile.\n\nSome early modern scholars, including A.D. Calumet (1672\u20131757), Rosenm\u00fcller (1768\u20131835), and Kell (1807\u20131888), believed the source river [for Eden] was a region of springs: \"The Pishon and Gihon were mountain streams.  The former may have been the Phasis or Araxes, and the latter the Oxus.\" \nJames A. Sauer, former curator of the Harvard Semitic Museum, made an argument from geology and history that Pishon referred to what is now the Wadi Bisha, a dry channel which begins in the Hijaz Mountains near Medina to run northeast to Kuwait.  With the aid of satellite photos, Farouk El-Baz of Boston University traced the dry channel from Kuwait up the Wadi Al-Batin and the Wadi Al-Rummah system originating near Medina. \n\nDavid Rohl identified Pishon with the Uizhun, placing Havilah to the northeast of Mesopotamia. The Uizhun is known locally as the Golden River. Rising near Mt. Sahand, it meanders between ancient gold mines and lodes of lapis lazuli before feeding the Caspian Sea. Such natural resources correspond to the ones associated with the land of Havilah in Genesis.\nQuestion:\nAccording to the Old Testament, which place is the source of the river that divides into four other rivers - the Pishon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates?\nAnswer:\nEden (Bible)\nPassage:\nBlue Cross (animal charity)\nBlue Cross is a registered animal welfare charity  in the United Kingdom, founded in 1897 as Our Dumb Friends League.  The charity provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership.\n\nThe charity works closely with a number of other organizations to promote animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.\n\nHistory\n\nThe organisation was founded on 10 May 1897 in London as Our Dumb Friends League, to care for working horses on the streets of the British capital.  It opened its first animal hospital, in Victoria, London, on 15 May 1906.\n\nIn 1912, the league launched The Blue Cross Fund to care for horses during the Balkan War. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, it was quickly reopened again. By the armistice in 1918, the Blue Cross Fund had raised nearly \u00a3170,000 \u2013 the equivalent of almost \u00a36.5 million today \u2013 to care for the animals of conflict. Over 50,000 horses were treated in Blue Cross hospitals in France, and the charity had sent vital veterinary supplies to 3,500 units of the British Army. \n\nDonations to the Fund enabled the charity to care for more than 350,000 animals during the Second World War, many of who were wounded during the Blitz. \nThe name of the appeal fund became more widely known than the official charity title and the league officially changed its name to \"The Blue Cross\" in 1950. In 2011 the charity dropped \"The\" from its name and is now simply known as \"Blue Cross.\"\n\nSally de la Bedoyere became the charity\u2019s CEO in November 2014. \n\nOperations\n\nBlue Cross operates a number of services throughout the United Kingdom.  Its major services are: rehoming unwanted animals, providing veterinary services to pet owners who cannot afford the private fees charged by private veterinary surgeons, promoting animal welfare through education, and operating the Pet Bereavement Support Service, a free and confidential support line for those who have lost a pet.  They also operate a horse ambulance service, including at large equestrian events.\n\nBlue Cross operates four animal hospitals, three of which are in London, at Victoria, Merton and Hammersmith, and a fourth in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, as well as running mobile clinics throughout the country. In 2014 it opened a pet care clinic in Derby.   Blue Cross carried out over 97,000 treatments, operations and diagnostic investigations in 2010.\n\nBlue Cross is also heavily involved in animal adoption, arranging adoption for companion animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits and small rodents, as well as larger species such as horses.   In 2013, the charity rehomed 8,191 animals. \n\nThe organisation also works to improve the lives of animals through promotion to pet owners and work in animal behaviour therapy. Every pet owner that rehomes a pet through the charity can benefit from free behaviour advice for the pet\u2019s lifetime. The Pet Bereavement Support Service is available 365 days a year to help people who are struggling to cope with the loss of a pet.\n\nProposed closure of two animal centres\n\nOn 26 January 2010, Blue Cross announced the proposed closure of the two animal adoption centres (Felixstowe and Northiam, East Sussex), both of which had been in existence for over 50 years. Final decisions on both sites were announced on 4 May 2010. After an extensive publicity campaign by locals, it was announced that plans to close the Felixstowe centre had been dropped.  The centre will relocate to a brand new site near Ipswich. Work on the purpose-built rehoming centre is due to begin in 2014. \n\nPartnerships\n\nThe Irish Blue Cross is a related party of Blue Cross.\n\nAwards\n\nMedals have been awarded by Blue Cross to animals and people who have demonstrated bravery or heroism. While the first medals were awarded to people who helped to rescue animals, medals were awarded in 1918 to honour a number of horses which had served in the First World War. Medals were then given out between 1940 and 1951 to a number of dogs, including Juliana who reportedly extinguished an incendiary bomb by urinating on it. In 2006 Jake, a police explosives dog, was given the honour after helping to clear out the London Underground after the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\nQuestion:\n\"Founded in 1897, which animal welfare charity was formerly known As \"\"Our Dumb Friends League\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nBlue Cross (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nKid Ory\nEdward \"Kid\" Ory (December 25, 1886 \u2013 January 23, 1973) was a jazz trombonist and bandleader. He was born in Woodland Plantation near La Place, Louisiana.\n\nBiography\n\nOry started playing music with home-made instruments in his childhood, and by his teens was leading a well-regarded band in Southeast Louisiana. He kept La Place, Louisiana, as his base of operations due to family obligations until his twenty-first birthday, when he moved his band to New Orleans, Louisiana. He was one of the most influential trombonists of early jazz.\n\nOry was a banjo player during his youth and it is said that his ability to play the banjo helped him develop \"tailgate\", a particular style of playing the trombone. In \"tailgate\" style the trombone plays a rhythmic line underneath the trumpets and cornets.\n\nWhile Ory was living on Jackson Avenue, he was discovered by Buddy Bolden, playing his first New trombone, instead of the old civil war trombone. But his sister said he was too young to play with Bolden.\n\nOry had one of the best-known bands in New Orleans in the 1910s, hiring many of the great jazz musicians of the city, including cornetists Joe \"King\" Oliver, Mutt Carey, and Louis Armstrong, who joined the band in 1919;  and clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone.\n\nIn 1919 he moved to Los Angeles\u2014one of a number of New Orleans musicians to do so near that time\u2014and he recorded there in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey, clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson, and string bassist Ed Garland. Garland and Carey were longtime associates who would still be playing with Ory during his 1940s comeback. While in Los Angeles Ory and his band recorded two instrumentals, \"Ory's Creole Trombone\" and \"Society Blues\", as well as a number of songs. They were the first jazz recordings made on the west coast by an African-American jazz band from New Orleans. His band recorded with the recording company Nordskog and Ory paid them for the pressings and then sold them under his own label of \"Kid Ory's Sunshine Orchestra\" at a store in Los Angeles called Spikes Brothers Music Store. In 1925, Ory moved to Chicago, where he was very active, working and recording with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and many others. He mentored Benny Goodman, and later Charles Mingus.\n\nDuring the Great Depression Ory retired from music and did not play again until 1943. From 1944 to about 1961 he led one of the top New Orleans style bands of the period. In addition to Mutt Carey and Ed Garland, trumpeters Alvin Alcorn and Teddy Buckner; clarinetists Darnell Howard, Jimmie Noone, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, and George Probert; pianists Buster Wilson, Cedric Haywood, and Don Ewell; and drummer Minor Hall were among his sidemen during this period. All but Probert, Buckner, and Ewell were originally from New Orleans.\n\nThe Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz, making popular 1940s radio broadcasts\u2014among them a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program (beginning March 15, 1944).    In 1944\u201345 the group made a series of recordings on the Crescent Records label, founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory's band. \n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Ory and his group appeared at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles.\n\nOry retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii, with the assistance of Trummy Young. Ory died in Honolulu. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. \nDiscography\n\nWith Red Allen \n*Red Allen, Kid Ory & Jack Teagarden at Newport (Verve, 1957)\nQuestion:\nWith which instrument do you associate the jazz musician Kid Ory?\nAnswer:\nHarmonic glissando\nPassage:\nnew VW Scirocco \u2013 Volkswagen UK\nScirocco : Volkswagen UK\n\u2020At the end of the agreement there are three options: i) own the vehicle: pay the optional final payment; ii) return the vehicle: subject to fair wear and tear, charges may apply; or iii) replace: part exchange the vehicle.\n1\u00a32,000 towards your deposit when purchased on Solutions PCP (excluding Scirocco base trim).\n2 Acceptance fee is not required\n3Payable with optional final payment.\nFinance subject to status. 18s and over.

Pangrams have been used to display typefaces, test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and keyboarding.\n\nThe best known English pangram is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" It has been used since at least the late 19th century, was utilized by Western Union to test Telex / TWX data communication equipment for accuracy and reliability,  and is now used by a number of computer programs (most notably the font viewer built into Microsoft Windows) to display computer fonts. An example in another language is ', containing all letters used in German , including every umlaut (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) plus the \u00df.  It has been used since before 1800.\n\nShort pangrams in English are more difficult to come up with and tend to use uncommon words. A perfect pangram contains every letter of the alphabet only once and can be considered an anagram of the alphabet; it is the shortest possible pangram.  An example is the phrase \"Cwm fjord bank glyphs vext quiz\" (', a loan word from Welsh, means a steep-sided valley, particularly in Wales). However, such examples are not usually understood even by native English speakers, and so arguably are not really English pangrams. \n\nHere are some short pangrams using standard written English, not involving abbreviations or proper nouns:\n# \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.\" (32 letters)\n# \"Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.\" (31 letters)\n# \"The five boxing wizards jump quickly.\" (31 letters)\n# \"How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!\" (30 letters)\n# \"Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.\" (29 letters)\n\nLonger pangrams may afford more opportunity for humor, cleverness, or thoughtfulness.   \n\nIn a sense, the pangram is the opposite of the lipogram, in which the aim is to omit one or more letters.\n\nLogographic scripts \n\nLogographic scripts, that is, writing systems composed principally of logograms, cannot be used to produce pangrams in the literal sense, since they are radically different from alphabets or other phonetic writing systems. In such scripts, the total number of signs is large and imprecisely defined, so producing a text with every possible sign is impossible. However, various analogies to pangrams are feasible, including traditional pangrams in a romanization. In Japanese, although typical orthography uses kanji (logograms), pangrams are required to contain every kana (syllabic character) when written out in kana alone: the Iroha is a classic example.\n\nIn addition, it is possible to create pangrams that demonstrate certain aspects of logographic characters.\n\nIn Chinese, the Thousand Character Classic is a 1000-character poem in which each character is used exactly once; however, it does not include all Chinese characters. The single character  (permanence) incorporates every basic stroke used to write Chinese characters exactly once, as described in the Eight Principles of Yong.\n\nSelf-enumerating pangrams \n\nA self-enumerating pangram is a pangrammatic autogram, or a sentence that inventories its own letters, each of which occurs at least once. The first example was produced by Rudy Kousbroek, a Dutch journalist and essayist, who publicly challenged Lee Sallows, a British recreational mathematician resident in the Netherlands, to produce an English translation of his Dutch pangram. In the sequel, Sallows built an electronic \"pangram machine\", that performed a  systematic search among millions of candidate solutions. The machine was successful in identifying the following 'magic' translation:   \nThis pangram contains four As, one B, two Cs, one D, thirty Es, six Fs, five Gs, seven Hs, eleven Is, one J, one K, two Ls, two Ms, eighteen Ns, fifteen Os, two Ps, one Q, five Rs, twenty-seven Ss, eighteen Ts, two Us, seven Vs, eight Ws, two Xs, three Ys, & one Z.\n\nChris Patuzzo, a British computer scientist was able to reduce the problem of finding a self-enumerating pangram to the Boolean satisfiability problem. He did this by using a bespoke Hardware description language as a stepping stone and then applied the Tseitin transformation to the resulting chip. \n\nPangrams in literature\n\nThe pangram \"The quick brown fox...\" and searches for a shorter pangram are the cornerstone of the plot of the novel Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn.  The search successfully comes to an end when the phrase \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs\" is discovered.\nQuestion:\nComplete the following pangram: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy what?\"\nAnswer:\ndog\nPassage:\nSWOT Analysis - What it is and how to use it\nSWOT Analysis - What it is and how to use it\nHome > Goal Setting > SWOT Analysis\nSWOT Analysis for Goal Setting\nSWOT, which stands for Strengths,     Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats, is a way to     analyze and evaluate your current situation and environment. While     it's typically used for strategic planning in business settings, it can also     be used in goal setting to help you identify goals that will give     you the most benefit. It is a way of matching your internal     capabilities, resources and liabilities with the external factors     you are facing.\nSWOT analysis works best when focused on a     particular result area .\nPerforming a SWOT Analysis\nYou start by identifying your strengths,     which represent your internal capabilities and resources in this     result area. Here are some questions you can use to help you get     started:\nWhat are your core competencies in this area?\nWhat relevant skills, talents or abilities do      you poses?\nWhat resources do you have at your disposal?\nWhat specialized knowledge or expertise do you have access      to?\nWho can you ask for advice, support or help?\nWhat special/proprietary tools can you use or develop?\nWhat is already working well in this area? What      related strengths does that reveal?\nKeep in mind that not all of these questions will     apply to every result area. Just use the ones that make sense to     help you identify your strengths.\nA SWOT analysis is essential for any goal in a              business. If you ever plan to run your own business, consider a              Business Administration degree from Anna Maria College online to learn how to do properly prepare a SWOT analysis.\nThe next step is to identify your weaknesses,     which represent your internal liabilities. In many cases, the lack of a     strength or resource can be considered a weakness. Here are some     ideas to help you identify your weaknesses:\nWhat are your main liabilities in this area?\nList all the relevant skills, abilities and      talents that you would find helpful in this result area. Which      ones are you the least good or proficient at?\nList the specialized knowledge or expertise that      you would find helpful in this result area. Any knowledge or      expertise that you lack could be considered a weakness.\nAre there any resources (money, time, help) that      you currently don't have access to?\nWhat is not working in this area right now? What      related weaknesses does that reveal?\nYour strengths and weaknesses give you     an idea of your internal capabilities, resources and liabilities.     The next step in SWOT analysis is to identify your external opportunities for profit, growth and improvement. Here are some     ideas to help you identify them:\nList the opportunities that you have been      considering.\nWhat things could you improve in this result      area?\nThink of one thing you could do that would      significantly improve your situation in this area.\nWhat important goals could you pursue?\nHow can you take advantage of your strengths?\nCan you take advantage of any changes in your      environment or circumstances?\nWhat opportunities would become available to you      if you eliminate some of your weaknesses?\nNow identify your threats, which represent     external events, environmental factors, or changes that could affect     you negatively. Here are some ideas to help you identify some     threats:\nMake a list of serious risks you are facing in      this area if you continue along your current path.\nWhat obstacles or roadblocks are impeding your      progress?\nWhat environmental factors are affecting you      negatively?\nThink about how current changes to your      environment or circumstances could affect you negatively.\nUsing SWOT Analysis to Identify Targets and     Strategies\nThe whole point of doing a SWOT analysis is to help     you identify the most beneficial targets and strategies to pursue     right now based on your current situation, and to identify     strategies that will help you prepare for the future.\nYou do this by analyzing the four quadrants of the     SWOT matrix.\nSWOT Quadrant I - Strengths/Opportunities (SO)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     take advantage of your core strengths to aggressively pursue the     best opportunities at your disposal. This is particularly important     if the opportunities are short-lived. An example would be to utilize     a temporary competitive advantage to gain market share in your     business.\nSWOT Quadrant II - Strengths/Threats (ST)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     utilize your strengths to actively eliminate or reduce threats you     are facing.\nSWOT Quadrant III-Weaknesses/Opportunities (WO)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you open up opportunities down the road by working to     reduce some of your weaknesses (or making your strengths even     stronger). You can use this quadrant to help you prepare a long-term     improvement plan.\nSWOT Quadrant IV - Weaknesses/Threats (WT)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you mitigate and avoid threats that could result from your     weaknesses. You could do this by eliminating the weaknesses and     turning them into strengths, or by developing defensive strategies     to reduce the likelihood or severity of the threat.\nSummary\nThe four SWOT quadrants provide different     perspectives to help you identify targets and strategies:\nSO Quadrant - Opportunities to Pursue\nST Quadrant - Threats to Eliminate\nWO Quadrant - Things to Improve\nWT Quadrant - Risk Mitigation & Avoidance\nOver the long term, you should include goals from     each of the four quadrants for balance. In the short term, you may     want to focus on one or two quadrants to take advantage of any     circumstances you are currently facing.\nSuccesses/Failures Analysis\nWhile SWOT analysis is a good way to examine you     current situation looking forward, it doesn't always reveal past     trends that you can learn from. A successes/failures analysis     complements the SWOT matrix and can give you more insight into your     strengths and weaknesses.\nYou start by listing all your successes and     achievements in this result area, followed by listing all your     failures or missteps. Once you've listed them, you can identify     additional strengths and weaknesses based on the trends that they     show you.\nQuestion:\nIn SWOT analysis used in business, for what does the 'S' stand?\nAnswer:\nSTRENGTHS, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats\nPassage:\nEndothermic process\nThe term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings; usually, but not always, in the form of heat. The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo-, derived from the word \"endon\" (\u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd) meaning \"within\" and the root \"therm\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc-) meaning \"hot.\" The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed. The opposite of an  endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases, \"gives out\" energy in the form of (usually, but not always) heat. Thus in each term (endothermic & exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs, though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes, without necessarily being in the form of heat.\n\nThe concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to, for example, chemical reactions, where thermal energy (heat) is converted to chemical bond energy.\n\nEndothermic (and exothermic) analysis only accounts for the enthalpy change (\u2206H) of a reaction. The full energy analysis of a reaction is the Gibbs free energy (\u2206G), which includes an entropy (\u2206S) and temperature term in addition to the enthalpy. A reaction will be a spontaneous process at a certain temperature if the products have a lower Gibbs free energy (an exergonic reaction) even if the enthalpy of the products is higher. Entropy and enthalpy are different terms, so the change in entropic energy can overcome an opposite change in enthalpic energy and make an endothermic reaction favorable.\n\nExamples\n\n* Photosynthesis\n* Melting ice\n* Evaporating liquid water\n* Sublimation of carbon dioxide (dry ice)\n* Cracking of alkanes\n* Thermal decomposition reactions\n* Electrolytic decomposition of sodium chloride into sodium hydroxide and hydrogen chloride \n* Dissolving ammonium chloride in water\n* Nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than nickel in stellar cores\n* High-energy neutrons can produce tritium from lithium-7 in an endothermic reaction, consuming 2.466 MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield.\n\n* Nuclear fusion of elements heavier than iron in supernovae\nQuestion:\nWhat is absorbed in an endothermic reaction?\nAnswer:\nHeat as energy\nPassage:\nBelgrade Theatre\nThe Belgrade Theatre is a live performance venue seating 858 and situated in Coventry, England. It was the first civic theatre to be built after the Second World War in Britain and as such was more than a place of entertainment. It joined the new Coventry Cathedral as a symbol of optimism and culture in one of the largest re-development projects then undertaken, to rebuild the city of Coventry, which had been almost totally destroyed by bombing. The building is now a grade II listed building. In 1963 the Belgrade was registered as a charity by the Charity Commission (number 219163). \nThe Belgrade acquired its name in recognition and thanks for a gift of timber from the Yugoslavian (today Serbian) capital city of Belgrade (Coventry's official sister city), that was used extensively in the construction of the auditorium. Since opening in 1958, the theatre has established itself as a centre for the new and innovative productions.\n\nHaving pioneered the Theatre-in-Education movement in the 1960s the theatre continues to work with disadvantaged young people and uses drama as a tool to develop personal and social skills. Their most successful programme \"Acting Out\" has been commissioned by Coventry's LEA for the last 10 years and has been replicated across the UK. One graduate of the course credits \"Acting Out\" with saving her life. \n\nThe theatre reopened in September 2007 after undergoing a \u00a312\u00a0million refurbishment with a 7-storey extension to provide a second auditorium.\n\nPrince Edward officially opened the refurbishment of the Belgrade's B2 studio on 5 February 2008, this also marked the 50th anniversary of the Belgrade's opening performed by Princess Alexandra.\nQuestion:\nIn which English city did the Belgrade Theatre open in 1958?\nAnswer:\nCofantre\nPassage:\nSomething Rotten\nSomething Rotten is the fourth\nbook in the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde.  It continues the story some two years after the point where The Well of Lost Plots leaves off.\n\nPlot introduction\n\nThe book sees Thursday return from the world of fiction to the alternative Swindon that Fforde introduced in The Eyre Affair; she is accompanied by Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, whose excursion from the world of fiction with Thursday forms the main sub-plot.\n\nThe title is taken from Hamlet I.iv:  \"Something is rotten in the State of Denmark\".\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947.  Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old.\n\nThursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him.  Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenberg cake, has some curious house guests:  Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos.  Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them.\n\nDespite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues.  She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the ageing English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike.\n\nThursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him.  On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\").  Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday.\n\nGoliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO\u2014at their headquarters in the Isle of Man\u2014and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness.  Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband.  Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilise. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly.\n\nOn top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy).\n\nShe succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.\nQuestion:\nWhich sport is played by the Reading Thwackers and the Swindon Mallets in the Jasper Fforde book \u2018Something Rotten\u2019?\nAnswer:\nCroquet mallet\nPassage:\nPresident George H. W. Bush - The White House | whitehouse.gov\nGeorge H. W. Bush | whitehouse.gov\nAir Force One\nGeorge H. W. Bush\nGeorge H. W. Bush, as the 41st President (1989-1993), brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States \"a kinder and gentler nation\" in the face of a dramatically changing world.\nGeorge Bush brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States \"a kinder and gentler nation.\" In his Inaugural Address he pledged in \"a moment rich with promise\" to use American strength as \"a force for good.\"\nComing from a family with a tradition of public service, George Herbert Walker Bush felt the responsibility to make his contribution both in time of war and in peace. Born in Milton, Massachusetts, on June 12, 1924, he became a student leader at Phillips Academy in Andover. On his 18th birthday he enlisted in the armed forces. The youngest pilot in the Navy when he received his wings, he flew 58 combat missions during World War II. On one mission over the Pacific as a torpedo bomber pilot he was shot down by Japanese antiaircraft fire and was rescued from the water by a U. S. submarine. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action.\nBush next turned his energies toward completing his education and raising a family. In January 1945 he married Barbara Pierce. They had six children-- George, Robin (who died as a child), John (known as Jeb), Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy.\nAt Yale University he excelled both in sports and in his studies; he was captain of the baseball team and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation Bush embarked on a career in the oil industry of West Texas.\nLike his father, Prescott Bush, who was elected a Senator from Connecticut in 1952, George became interested in public service and politics. He served two terms as a Representative to Congress from Texas. Twice he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate. Then he was appointed to a series of high-level positions: Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U. S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\nIn 1980 Bush campaigned for the Republican nomination for President. He lost, but was chosen as a running mate by Ronald Reagan. As Vice President, Bush had responsibility in several domestic areas, including Federal deregulation and anti-drug programs, and visited scores of foreign countries. In 1988 Bush won the Republican nomination for President and, with Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate, he defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the general election.\nBush faced a dramatically changing world, as the Cold War ended after 40 bitter years, the Communist empire broke up, and the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union ceased to exist; and reformist President Mikhail Gorbachev, whom Bush had supported, resigned. While Bush hailed the march of democracy, he insisted on restraint in U. S. policy toward the group of new nations.\nIn other areas of foreign policy, President Bush sent American troops into Panama to overthrow the corrupt regime of General Manuel Noriega, who was threatening the security of the canal and the Americans living there. Noriega was brought to the United States for trial as a drug trafficker.\nBush's greatest test came when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, then threatened to move into Saudi Arabia. Vowing to free Kuwait, Bush rallied the United Nations, the U. S. people, and Congress and sent 425,000 American troops. They were joined by 118,000 troops from allied nations. After weeks of air and missile bombardment, the 100-hour land battle dubbed Desert Storm routed Iraq's million-man army.\nDespite unprecedented popularity from this military and diplomatic triumph, Bush was unable to withstand discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending. In 1992 he lost his bid for reelection to Democrat William Clinton.\nThe Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from \u201cThe Presidents of the United States of America,\u201d by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey.

Six streets converge at the junction: Park Lane (from the north), Piccadilly (northeast), Constitution Hill (southeast), Grosvenor Place (south), Grosvenor Crescent (southwest) and Knightsbridge (west).\n\nHyde Park Corner tube station, a London Underground station served by the Piccadilly line, is located at the junction as well as a number of notable monuments.\n\nImmediately to the north of the junction is Apsley House, the home of the first Duke of Wellington, and several monuments to the Duke were erected in the vicinity in his lifetime and subsequently.\n\nEvolution and development \n\n \nIn the centre of the Hyde Park Corner traffic island stands the Wellington Arch (or Constitution Arch), designed by Decimus Burton and planned as a northern gate to the grounds of Buckingham Palace.  In execution, it was laid out as a gate into the Green Park and was originally sited directly opposite Burton's Ionic Screen (also known as the Hyde Park Corner Screen) which still provides a gate into Hyde Park.  Originally, the arch was topped with an equestrian statue of the Duke (by Matthew Cotes Wyatt).  \n\nBecause of traffic congestion, the arch was moved south and realigned to the axis of Constitution Hill in 1883. The boundary of Buckingham Palace's garden were moved south, and a new road named Duke of Wellington Place was created separating the space containing the arch from the rest of the Green Park. At this time the large equestrian statue was removed to Sandhurst.  It was subsequently replaced with the current work, entitled The Angel of Peace descending on the Quadriga of Victory, dated 1912, by the sculptor Adrian Jones. \n\nFollowing the passage of the Park Lane Improvement Act 1958, Park Lane was widened in the early 1960s.  For most of its length this was achieved by converting the former East Carriage Drive of Hyde Park into the northbund lanes of a dual carriageway, but at Hyde Park Corner, all lanes of traffic came together on a line immediately to the east of Apsley House that required demolition of houses on Piccadilly. This left Apsley House on an island site.  The InterContinental London hotel was subsequently built on the cleared site between the new route of Park Lane and Hamilton Place.\n\nAt part of the same scheme, a tunnel was constructed beneath the junction to allow traffic to flow freely between Knightsbridge and Piccadilly.   As a result, the area around the arch became a large traffic island, mostly laid to grass, and accessible only by pedestrian underpassess, and formally ceased to be part of the Green Park.\n\nSubsequent changes to the road layout in the 1990s reinstated a route between Hyde Park and the Green Park for pedestrians, cyclists and horseriders using surface level crossings.\n\nThe traffic island includes a smaller equestrian statue of Wellington by Edgar Boehm unveiled in 1888, the Machine Gun Corps Memorial, the Royal Artillery Memorial, the Australian War Memorial and the New Zealand War Memorial. \n\nOther monuments in the vicinity of Hyde Park Corner include  Adrian Jones's Monument to the Cavalry of the Empire (off the west side of Park Lane),  Alexander Munro's Boy and Dolphin statue (in a rose garden parallel to Rotten Row, going west from Hyde Park Corner), the Queen Elizabeth Gate (behind Apsley House), the Wellington Monument (off the west side of Park Lane), and a statue of Lord Byron (on a traffic island opposite the Wellington Monument).\n\nThe term is often erroneously used for Speakers' Corner, which is located at the north-eastern corner of Hyde Park.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n*The 1935 film Hyde Park Corner takes its name from the area, where it is set.\n*\"Hyde Park Corner\" was used as a codeword to announce to the government the death of King George VI in 1952. \n\nGallery of memorials\n\nFile:Australian War Memorial, Hyde Park Corner - geograph.org.uk - 1463114.jpg|Australian War Memorial\nFile:Byron Statue - geograph.org.uk - 1574255.jpg|Statue of Lord Byron\nFile:Statue of the Duke of Wellington - geograph.org.uk - 397832.jpg|Equestrian Statue of the Duke of Wellington\nFile:DavidLondon.JPG|Machine Gun Corps Memorial\nFile:NZ war memorial, London.JPG|New Zealand War Memorial\nFile:Royal Artillery Memorial, outside Aspley House, London.JPG|Royal Artillery Memorial\nQuestion:\nNamed after the 16/17th century fancy collar that made a fortune for Robert Baker, which London street starts at Hyde Park Corner and ends at a famous statue ?

Anatomy of seed plants. John Wiley and Sons, New York. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of Gaultheria procumbens or Syzygium jambos. Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, with much of the fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium.  Other example could be the anthocarps specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls).\n\nFruit with fleshy seeds, such as pomegranate or mamoncillo, are not considered to be accessory fruit.\n\nThe terms false fruit, spurious fruit, and pseudocarp are older terms for accessory fruit that have been criticized as \"inapt\", and are not used by botanists today.\nQuestion:\nPseudocarp relates to which type of crop?\nAnswer:\nFruiting\n\n\nPassage:\n2009 Songs in Popular Music - Pop Culture Madness\n2009 Songs in Popular Music\n2009's Biggest Artists,              Albums and Songs\n\u266b Adele (Best New Artist            Grammy Winner) \u266b Robert Plant & Alison Krauss (Grammy for Album of the Year)\nPlease Read The Letter - Alison Krauss and Robert Plant (Grammy for            Record of the Year)\n2009's Retro Top 10 Hits\n1. \u266b Fire Burning - Sean Kingston 2. \u266b Fireflies - Owl City 3. \u266b Whatcha Say - Jason Derulo 4. \u266b Don't Stop Believin - Glee Cast 5. \u266b Chasing Pavements - Adele 6. \u266b Good Girls Gone Bad - Cobra Starship with Leighton Meester 7. \u266b Right Round - Flo Rida (with Kesha) 8. \u266b Don't Trust Me - 3OH!3 9. \u266b I Love College - Asher Roth 10. \u266b My Life Would Suck Without You - Kelly Clarkson\n2009's Dance Top 10              Hit List\n1. \u266b I Gotta Feeling - Black Eyed Peas 2. \u266b Bad Romance - Lady Gaga 3. \u266b I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho) - Pitbull 4. \u266b Just Dance - Lady Gaga 5. \u266b Evacuate The Dancefloor - Cascada 6. \u266b Boom Boom Pow - Black Eyed Peas 7. \u266b Poker Face - Lady Gaga 8. \u266b 3 - Britney Spears 9. \u266b Hotel Room Service - Pitbull 10. \u266b Heartless - Kanye West\n2009's Bubblegum 10              Hit List\n1. \u266b Party In The USA - Miley Cyrus 2. \u266b Love Story - Taylor Swift 3. \u266b Say Hey (I Love You) - Micheal Franti and Spearhead with Cherine Anderson 4. \u266b Favorite Girl - Justin Beiber 5. \u266b Fifteen - Taylor Swift 6. \u266b The Climb - Miley Cyrus 7. \u266b One Less Lonely Girl - Justin Beiber 8. \u266b Paranoid - Jonas Brothers 9. \u266b Hoedown Throwdown - Miley Cyrus 10. \u266b Jai Ho!

The author of works like The Raven and the The Black Cat was found in a confused state on the streets of Baltimore in October 1849 and died in a city hospital a few days later at the age of 40.\nA life-size replica of Poe's body went on display in a pine casket at the Poe House in Baltimore on October 7 for visitors to pay their respects, according to Jeff Jerome, curator of the Poe Museum.\n\"This actually is the bicentennial of Poe's birth and there was very little we could do with the birth so we thought we would recreate Poe's funeral since his original funeral was very quick. There were only seven people in attendance,\" Jerome told Reuters Television.\n\"I thought this would be Baltimore's chance to make it right, to do it the right way.\"\nThe casket was loaded onto an old fashioned hearse and taken through the city to Westminster Burying Ground where the writer is buried.\nMany Poe fans gathered to bid a proper farewell to the writer whose life had been a struggle as he made very little money from his writing.\nMany dressed in period costumes to join the funeral procession, some dressed as famous people who had either known Poe or had been inspired by him, such as Walt Whitman, Charles Baudelaire, and Alfred Hitchcock.\n\"Personally Edgar Allan Poe has meant so much to me as far as his creativity and originality so it is great to be here. It's a privilege to be here and honour him,\" said one Poe fan, Roger Bow, who had come from New York for the event.\nTOP\nQuestion:\nWhich author's funeral took place in Baltimore US, 160 years after his death?\nAnswer:\nEdgar alen poe\nPassage:\nClassic BBC Radio Theme ~ Music While You Work - YouTube\nClassic BBC Radio Theme ~ Music While You Work - YouTube\nClassic BBC Radio Theme ~ Music While You Work\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

It began broadcasting in June 1940 during World War II, with the intention of helping the war effort. It was perceived that the productivity of manual labour could be raised by offering a non-stop medley of popular music played at an even tempo, to accompany the working day in factories. For a certain period, a recorded version was rebroadcast in the late evening, to entertain night-shift workers. After the war, the broadcasts continued on the newly-formed BBC Light Programme.\nMusic While You Work was discontinued in 1967 when most Light Programme offerings were transitioned to BBC Radio 2. However, it was revived in the 1980s; initially for one week to mark the BBC's 60th anniversary in October 1982 and then as a regular part of the Radio 2 schedules from January 1983 to January 1984\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWhich radio programme used 'Calling All Workers' as its theme tune?\nAnswer:\nMusic While You Work\nPassage:\nPhlebitis\nPhlebitis or venitis is the inflammation of a vein, usually in the legs. It most commonly occurs in superficial veins. Phlebitis often occurs in conjunction with thrombosis and is then called \"thrombophlebitis\" or \"superficial thrombophlebitis\". Unlike deep vein thrombosis, the probability that superficial thrombophlebitis will cause a clot to break up and be transported in pieces to the lung is very low. \n\nSigns and symptoms\n\n* Localized redness and swelling\n* Pain or burning along the length of the vein \n* Vein being hard and cord-like \n\nCause\n\nPhlebitis is typically caused by local trauma to a vein, usually from the insertion of an intravenous catheter.  However, phlebitis can also occur due to a complication of connective tissue disorders such as lupus, or of pancreatic, breast, or ovarian cancers. Phlebitis can also result from certain medications and drugs that irritate the veins, such as desomorphine. \n\nSuperficial phlebitis often presents as an early sign in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), a vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins in distal extremities often associated with cigarette smoking. \n\nManagement\n\nTreatment usually consists of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and local compression (e.g., by compression stockings or a compress).  If the phlebitis is associated with local bacterial infection, antibiotics may be used. \n\nFor acute infusion superficial thrombophlebitis there is not enough evidence as of 2015 to determine treatment. \n\nHistory\n\nPhlebitis was first described by John Hunter in 1784.\nQuestion:\nWhat specific part of the body is affected by phlebitis?\nAnswer:\nVein valves\nPassage:\nGreg LeMond - How Have Steroids Changed Cycling ... - YouTube\nGreg LeMond - How Have Steroids Changed Cycling? - YouTube\nGreg LeMond - How Have Steroids Changed Cycling?\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nThe interactive transcript could not be loaded.\nLoading...\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

During 2007, he played an unexpected role in the international arbitration hearing that eventually decided American cyclist Floyd Landis should forfeit his 2006 Tour de France title due to testing that found abnormally high levels of testosterone. LeMond testified that he had spoken with Landis after his \"A\" urine sample had tested positive, urging him that if his \"B\" sample was also positive, he should come clean, help his sport, and \"more importantly, help himself.\" Before his testimony, LeMond had been threatened by Landis' manager.\nThe doping problem has been most public in the Tour de France - two stage winners of the 2007 Tour withdrew from the race amid doping allegations - but its influence is so pervasive that T-Mobile recently withdrew its sponsorship of a professional cycling team, stating that the company did not want to associate its brand with doping. - Santa Clara University\nGreg LeMond is a former professional road bicycle racer from the United States and a three time winner of the Tour de France in 1986, 1989, and 1990.\nGwen Knapp is a staff writer for the sports section of the San Francisco Chronicle.\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWith which sport would you associate Greg Le Mond?\nAnswer:\nCyclist\nPassage:\nPiculet\nThe piculets are a distinctive subfamily of small woodpeckers which occur mainly in tropical South America, with just three Asian and one African  species.\n\nLike the true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues which they use to extract their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, but they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.\n\nTheir bills are shorter and less dagger-like than  the true woodpeckers, so they look for insects and grubs mainly in decaying wood. Similarly, they re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.\n\nTypically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.\n\nSystematics and evolution\n\nAlthough not well known from fossils, the evolution of piculets is now considered rather straightforward. The disjunct occurrence of the genera, with one African species of the Southeast Asian Sasia and one Southeast Asian species of the American Picumnus is of comparatively recent origin. Molecular dating, calibrated with geographic events in the absence of a good fossil record, points at the Late Miocene, c. 8 MYA, as the point where the two genera divided into their two respective lineages. At that time, there was a notable global cooling period. The molecular distances between piculets and woodpeckers are comparatively small for subfamilies, agreeing with the hypothesis that the split between the three groups of woodpecker-like picids subfamilies occurred only during the Miocene climate optimum, around 15 MYA. The later radiation of South American piculets is probably due to changes in topology and climate fluctuations during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The genus Verreauxia may be accepted because of pronounced morphological similarities, but the two Picumnus lineages, despite having diverged long ago, are virtually alike except for head coloration (Fuchs et al., 2006).\n\nThe Antillean piculet (Nesoctites micromegas) has proven to be a very distinct species evolutionarily between piculets and woodpeckers (Benz et al., 2006) and thus is nowadays placed in a subfamily of its own.\n\nThe arrangement of species in the genera follows del Hoyo et al.

Its surface is 52 ft above sea level. Loch Ness is best known for alleged sightings of the cryptozoological Loch Ness Monster, also known affectionately as \"Nessie\". It is connected at the southern end by the River Oich and a section of the Caledonian Canal to Loch Oich. At the northern end there is the Bona Narrows which opens out into Loch Dochfour, which feeds the River Ness and a further section of canal to Inverness. It is one of a series of interconnected, murky bodies of water in Scotland; its water visibility is exceptionally low due to a high peat content in the surrounding soil.\n\nLoch Ness is the second largest Scottish loch by surface area at 56 sqkm after Loch Lomond, but due to its great depth, it is the largest by volume in the British Isles. Its deepest point is 755 ft,   making it the second deepest loch in Scotland after Loch Morar. A 2016 survey claimed to have discovered a crevice that pushed the depth to 889 ft but further research determined it to be a sonar anomaly.    It contains more fresh water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined, and is the largest body of water on the Great Glen Fault, which runs from Inverness in the north to Fort William in the south.\n\nVillages and places\n\nAt Drumnadrochit is the \"Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition\"  which examines the natural history and legend of Loch Ness. Boat cruises operate from various locations on the loch shore, giving visitors the chance to look for the \"monster\".\n\nUrquhart Castle is located on the western shore, 1 mi east of Drumnadrochit.\n\nLighthouses are located at Lochend (Bona Lighthouse) and Fort Augustus.\n\nMonster\n\nLoch Ness is thought by some to be the home of the Loch Ness Monster (also known as \"Nessie\"), a cryptid, reputedly a large unknown animal. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. Popular interest and belief in the animal's existence has varied since it was first brought to the world's attention in 1933. \n\nFish species\n\nThe following fish species are native to Loch Ness. A number of others such as perch and roach have been introduced in the Loch or Caledonian Canal with various levels of success. \n\nIsland \n\nThe only island on Loch Ness is Cherry Island, visible at its southwestern end, near Fort Augustus. It is a crannog, which is a form of artificial island. Most crannogs were constructed during the Iron Age.\n\nThere was formerly a second island (Dog Island) which was submerged when the water level was raised during the construction of the Caledonian Canal.\n\nHydroelectricity\n\nLoch Ness serves as the lower storage reservoir for the Foyers pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme, which was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The turbines were originally used to provide power for a nearby aluminium smelting plant, but now electricity is generated and supplied to the National Grid. Another scheme, the 100 MW Glendoe Hydro Scheme near Fort Augustus, began generation in June 2009 producing 76 gigawatt hours in its first months of operation, It was out of service between 2009 and 2012 for repair of the tunnels connecting the reservoir to the turbines \n\nGeology\n\nLoch Ness lies along the Great Glen Fault, which forms a line of weakness in the rocks which has been excavated by glacial erosion, forming the Great Glen and the basins of Loch Lochy, Loch Oich and Loch Ness. \n\nImage gallery\n\nImage:Wt9 schleuse3 augustus locks.jpg|Locks on Caledonian Canal in Fort Augustus, Loch Ness in the background\nImage:Loch Ness 0406.JPG|Loch Ness looking south, taken in May 2006.\nImage:Loch_Ness_Panorama.png|Sunrise over Loch Ness, taken at Urquhart Castle\nImage:Loch_Ness_Panoramin_July_2008.JPG|Loch Ness panorama from a ship in 2008\n\nLoch Ness records\n\nJohn Cobb died in an attempt at the water speed record when his boat Crusader struck an unexplained wake on the surface of the loch in 1952. His accident was recorded by the BBC reporters on site at the time.  Nearby, there is a memorial to him erected by the people of Glenurquhart\n\nOn 31 August 1974, David Scott Munro, of Ross-shire Caberfeidh Water Ski Club, became the first person in the world to water ski (mono ski) the length of Loch Ness. From Lochend to Fort Augustus and back, he covered the 48 miles in 77 minutes at an average speed of 37 mph. \n\nBrenda Sherratt was the first person to swim  along the length of Loch Ness in Scotland in 31 hours and 27 minutes in July 1966.\nQuestion:\nWhich canal joins Loch Ness to the Moray Firth\nAnswer:\nCaledonian Canal Commissioners\nPassage:\nPishon\nThe Pishon ( P\u00ee\u0161\u014dn) is one of four rivers (along with Hiddekel (Tigris), Phrath (Euphrates) and Gihon) mentioned in the Biblical Book of Genesis. In that passage, these rivers are described as arising within the Garden of Eden. The Pishon is described as encircling \"the entire land of Havilah.\" \n\nIdentification \n\nUnlike the Tigris and the Euphrates, the Pishon has never been clearly located. It is briefly mentioned together with the Tigris in the Wisdom of Sirach (24:25), but this reference throws no more light on the location of the river. The Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus, in the beginning of his Antiquities of the Jews (1st century AD) identified the Pishon with the Ganges.  The medieval French rabbi Rashi identified it with the Nile.\n\nSome early modern scholars, including A.D. Calumet (1672\u20131757), Rosenm\u00fcller (1768\u20131835), and Kell (1807\u20131888), believed the source river [for Eden] was a region of springs: \"The Pishon and Gihon were mountain streams.  The former may have been the Phasis or Araxes, and the latter the Oxus.\" \nJames A. Sauer, former curator of the Harvard Semitic Museum, made an argument from geology and history that Pishon referred to what is now the Wadi Bisha, a dry channel which begins in the Hijaz Mountains near Medina to run northeast to Kuwait.  With the aid of satellite photos, Farouk El-Baz of Boston University traced the dry channel from Kuwait up the Wadi Al-Batin and the Wadi Al-Rummah system originating near Medina. \n\nDavid Rohl identified Pishon with the Uizhun, placing Havilah to the northeast of Mesopotamia. The Uizhun is known locally as the Golden River. Rising near Mt. Sahand, it meanders between ancient gold mines and lodes of lapis lazuli before feeding the Caspian Sea. Such natural resources correspond to the ones associated with the land of Havilah in Genesis.\nQuestion:\nAccording to the Old Testament, which place is the source of the river that divides into four other rivers - the Pishon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates?\nAnswer:\nEden (Bible)\nPassage:\nBlue Cross (animal charity)\nBlue Cross is a registered animal welfare charity  in the United Kingdom, founded in 1897 as Our Dumb Friends League.  The charity provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership.\n\nThe charity works closely with a number of other organizations to promote animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.\n\nHistory\n\nThe organisation was founded on 10 May 1897 in London as Our Dumb Friends League, to care for working horses on the streets of the British capital.  It opened its first animal hospital, in Victoria, London, on 15 May 1906.\n\nIn 1912, the league launched The Blue Cross Fund to care for horses during the Balkan War. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, it was quickly reopened again. By the armistice in 1918, the Blue Cross Fund had raised nearly \u00a3170,000 \u2013 the equivalent of almost \u00a36.5 million today \u2013 to care for the animals of conflict. Over 50,000 horses were treated in Blue Cross hospitals in France, and the charity had sent vital veterinary supplies to 3,500 units of the British Army. \n\nDonations to the Fund enabled the charity to care for more than 350,000 animals during the Second World War, many of who were wounded during the Blitz. \nThe name of the appeal fund became more widely known than the official charity title and the league officially changed its name to \"The Blue Cross\" in 1950. In 2011 the charity dropped \"The\" from its name and is now simply known as \"Blue Cross.\"\n\nSally de la Bedoyere became the charity\u2019s CEO in November 2014. \n\nOperations\n\nBlue Cross operates a number of services throughout the United Kingdom.  Its major services are: rehoming unwanted animals, providing veterinary services to pet owners who cannot afford the private fees charged by private veterinary surgeons, promoting animal welfare through education, and operating the Pet Bereavement Support Service, a free and confidential support line for those who have lost a pet.  They also operate a horse ambulance service, including at large equestrian events.\n\nBlue Cross operates four animal hospitals, three of which are in London, at Victoria, Merton and Hammersmith, and a fourth in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, as well as running mobile clinics throughout the country. In 2014 it opened a pet care clinic in Derby.   Blue Cross carried out over 97,000 treatments, operations and diagnostic investigations in 2010.\n\nBlue Cross is also heavily involved in animal adoption, arranging adoption for companion animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits and small rodents, as well as larger species such as horses.   In 2013, the charity rehomed 8,191 animals. \n\nThe organisation also works to improve the lives of animals through promotion to pet owners and work in animal behaviour therapy. Every pet owner that rehomes a pet through the charity can benefit from free behaviour advice for the pet\u2019s lifetime. The Pet Bereavement Support Service is available 365 days a year to help people who are struggling to cope with the loss of a pet.\n\nProposed closure of two animal centres\n\nOn 26 January 2010, Blue Cross announced the proposed closure of the two animal adoption centres (Felixstowe and Northiam, East Sussex), both of which had been in existence for over 50 years. Final decisions on both sites were announced on 4 May 2010. After an extensive publicity campaign by locals, it was announced that plans to close the Felixstowe centre had been dropped.  The centre will relocate to a brand new site near Ipswich. Work on the purpose-built rehoming centre is due to begin in 2014. \n\nPartnerships\n\nThe Irish Blue Cross is a related party of Blue Cross.\n\nAwards\n\nMedals have been awarded by Blue Cross to animals and people who have demonstrated bravery or heroism. While the first medals were awarded to people who helped to rescue animals, medals were awarded in 1918 to honour a number of horses which had served in the First World War. Medals were then given out between 1940 and 1951 to a number of dogs, including Juliana who reportedly extinguished an incendiary bomb by urinating on it. In 2006 Jake, a police explosives dog, was given the honour after helping to clear out the London Underground after the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\nQuestion:\n\"Founded in 1897, which animal welfare charity was formerly known As \"\"Our Dumb Friends League\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nBlue Cross (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nKid Ory\nEdward \"Kid\" Ory (December 25, 1886 \u2013 January 23, 1973) was a jazz trombonist and bandleader. He was born in Woodland Plantation near La Place, Louisiana.\n\nBiography\n\nOry started playing music with home-made instruments in his childhood, and by his teens was leading a well-regarded band in Southeast Louisiana. He kept La Place, Louisiana, as his base of operations due to family obligations until his twenty-first birthday, when he moved his band to New Orleans, Louisiana. He was one of the most influential trombonists of early jazz.\n\nOry was a banjo player during his youth and it is said that his ability to play the banjo helped him develop \"tailgate\", a particular style of playing the trombone. In \"tailgate\" style the trombone plays a rhythmic line underneath the trumpets and cornets.\n\nWhile Ory was living on Jackson Avenue, he was discovered by Buddy Bolden, playing his first New trombone, instead of the old civil war trombone. But his sister said he was too young to play with Bolden.\n\nOry had one of the best-known bands in New Orleans in the 1910s, hiring many of the great jazz musicians of the city, including cornetists Joe \"King\" Oliver, Mutt Carey, and Louis Armstrong, who joined the band in 1919;  and clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone.\n\nIn 1919 he moved to Los Angeles\u2014one of a number of New Orleans musicians to do so near that time\u2014and he recorded there in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey, clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson, and string bassist Ed Garland. Garland and Carey were longtime associates who would still be playing with Ory during his 1940s comeback. While in Los Angeles Ory and his band recorded two instrumentals, \"Ory's Creole Trombone\" and \"Society Blues\", as well as a number of songs. They were the first jazz recordings made on the west coast by an African-American jazz band from New Orleans. His band recorded with the recording company Nordskog and Ory paid them for the pressings and then sold them under his own label of \"Kid Ory's Sunshine Orchestra\" at a store in Los Angeles called Spikes Brothers Music Store. In 1925, Ory moved to Chicago, where he was very active, working and recording with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and many others. He mentored Benny Goodman, and later Charles Mingus.\n\nDuring the Great Depression Ory retired from music and did not play again until 1943. From 1944 to about 1961 he led one of the top New Orleans style bands of the period. In addition to Mutt Carey and Ed Garland, trumpeters Alvin Alcorn and Teddy Buckner; clarinetists Darnell Howard, Jimmie Noone, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, and George Probert; pianists Buster Wilson, Cedric Haywood, and Don Ewell; and drummer Minor Hall were among his sidemen during this period. All but Probert, Buckner, and Ewell were originally from New Orleans.\n\nThe Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz, making popular 1940s radio broadcasts\u2014among them a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program (beginning March 15, 1944).    In 1944\u201345 the group made a series of recordings on the Crescent Records label, founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory's band. \n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Ory and his group appeared at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles.\n\nOry retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii, with the assistance of Trummy Young. Ory died in Honolulu. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. \nDiscography\n\nWith Red Allen \n*Red Allen, Kid Ory & Jack Teagarden at Newport (Verve, 1957)\nQuestion:\nWith which instrument do you associate the jazz musician Kid Ory?\nAnswer:\nHarmonic glissando\nPassage:\nnew VW Scirocco \u2013 Volkswagen UK\nScirocco : Volkswagen UK\n\u2020At the end of the agreement there are three options: i) own the vehicle: pay the optional final payment; ii) return the vehicle: subject to fair wear and tear, charges may apply; or iii) replace: part exchange the vehicle.\n1\u00a32,000 towards your deposit when purchased on Solutions PCP (excluding Scirocco base trim).\n2 Acceptance fee is not required\n3Payable with optional final payment.\nFinance subject to status. 18s and over.

Pangrams have been used to display typefaces, test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and keyboarding.\n\nThe best known English pangram is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" It has been used since at least the late 19th century, was utilized by Western Union to test Telex / TWX data communication equipment for accuracy and reliability,  and is now used by a number of computer programs (most notably the font viewer built into Microsoft Windows) to display computer fonts. An example in another language is ', containing all letters used in German , including every umlaut (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) plus the \u00df.  It has been used since before 1800.\n\nShort pangrams in English are more difficult to come up with and tend to use uncommon words. A perfect pangram contains every letter of the alphabet only once and can be considered an anagram of the alphabet; it is the shortest possible pangram.  An example is the phrase \"Cwm fjord bank glyphs vext quiz\" (', a loan word from Welsh, means a steep-sided valley, particularly in Wales). However, such examples are not usually understood even by native English speakers, and so arguably are not really English pangrams. \n\nHere are some short pangrams using standard written English, not involving abbreviations or proper nouns:\n# \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.\" (32 letters)\n# \"Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.\" (31 letters)\n# \"The five boxing wizards jump quickly.\" (31 letters)\n# \"How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!\" (30 letters)\n# \"Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.\" (29 letters)\n\nLonger pangrams may afford more opportunity for humor, cleverness, or thoughtfulness.   \n\nIn a sense, the pangram is the opposite of the lipogram, in which the aim is to omit one or more letters.\n\nLogographic scripts \n\nLogographic scripts, that is, writing systems composed principally of logograms, cannot be used to produce pangrams in the literal sense, since they are radically different from alphabets or other phonetic writing systems. In such scripts, the total number of signs is large and imprecisely defined, so producing a text with every possible sign is impossible. However, various analogies to pangrams are feasible, including traditional pangrams in a romanization. In Japanese, although typical orthography uses kanji (logograms), pangrams are required to contain every kana (syllabic character) when written out in kana alone: the Iroha is a classic example.\n\nIn addition, it is possible to create pangrams that demonstrate certain aspects of logographic characters.\n\nIn Chinese, the Thousand Character Classic is a 1000-character poem in which each character is used exactly once; however, it does not include all Chinese characters. The single character  (permanence) incorporates every basic stroke used to write Chinese characters exactly once, as described in the Eight Principles of Yong.\n\nSelf-enumerating pangrams \n\nA self-enumerating pangram is a pangrammatic autogram, or a sentence that inventories its own letters, each of which occurs at least once. The first example was produced by Rudy Kousbroek, a Dutch journalist and essayist, who publicly challenged Lee Sallows, a British recreational mathematician resident in the Netherlands, to produce an English translation of his Dutch pangram. In the sequel, Sallows built an electronic \"pangram machine\", that performed a  systematic search among millions of candidate solutions. The machine was successful in identifying the following 'magic' translation:   \nThis pangram contains four As, one B, two Cs, one D, thirty Es, six Fs, five Gs, seven Hs, eleven Is, one J, one K, two Ls, two Ms, eighteen Ns, fifteen Os, two Ps, one Q, five Rs, twenty-seven Ss, eighteen Ts, two Us, seven Vs, eight Ws, two Xs, three Ys, & one Z.\n\nChris Patuzzo, a British computer scientist was able to reduce the problem of finding a self-enumerating pangram to the Boolean satisfiability problem. He did this by using a bespoke Hardware description language as a stepping stone and then applied the Tseitin transformation to the resulting chip. \n\nPangrams in literature\n\nThe pangram \"The quick brown fox...\" and searches for a shorter pangram are the cornerstone of the plot of the novel Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn.  The search successfully comes to an end when the phrase \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs\" is discovered.\nQuestion:\nComplete the following pangram: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy what?\"\nAnswer:\ndog\nPassage:\nSWOT Analysis - What it is and how to use it\nSWOT Analysis - What it is and how to use it\nHome > Goal Setting > SWOT Analysis\nSWOT Analysis for Goal Setting\nSWOT, which stands for Strengths,     Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats, is a way to     analyze and evaluate your current situation and environment. While     it's typically used for strategic planning in business settings, it can also     be used in goal setting to help you identify goals that will give     you the most benefit.

Just use the ones that make sense to     help you identify your strengths.\nA SWOT analysis is essential for any goal in a              business. If you ever plan to run your own business, consider a              Business Administration degree from Anna Maria College online to learn how to do properly prepare a SWOT analysis.\nThe next step is to identify your weaknesses,     which represent your internal liabilities. In many cases, the lack of a     strength or resource can be considered a weakness. Here are some     ideas to help you identify your weaknesses:\nWhat are your main liabilities in this area?\nList all the relevant skills, abilities and      talents that you would find helpful in this result area. Which      ones are you the least good or proficient at?\nList the specialized knowledge or expertise that      you would find helpful in this result area. Any knowledge or      expertise that you lack could be considered a weakness.\nAre there any resources (money, time, help) that      you currently don't have access to?\nWhat is not working in this area right now? What      related weaknesses does that reveal?\nYour strengths and weaknesses give you     an idea of your internal capabilities, resources and liabilities.     The next step in SWOT analysis is to identify your external opportunities for profit, growth and improvement. Here are some     ideas to help you identify them:\nList the opportunities that you have been      considering.\nWhat things could you improve in this result      area?\nThink of one thing you could do that would      significantly improve your situation in this area.\nWhat important goals could you pursue?\nHow can you take advantage of your strengths?\nCan you take advantage of any changes in your      environment or circumstances?\nWhat opportunities would become available to you      if you eliminate some of your weaknesses?\nNow identify your threats, which represent     external events, environmental factors, or changes that could affect     you negatively. Here are some ideas to help you identify some     threats:\nMake a list of serious risks you are facing in      this area if you continue along your current path.\nWhat obstacles or roadblocks are impeding your      progress?\nWhat environmental factors are affecting you      negatively?\nThink about how current changes to your      environment or circumstances could affect you negatively.\nUsing SWOT Analysis to Identify Targets and     Strategies\nThe whole point of doing a SWOT analysis is to help     you identify the most beneficial targets and strategies to pursue     right now based on your current situation, and to identify     strategies that will help you prepare for the future.\nYou do this by analyzing the four quadrants of the     SWOT matrix.\nSWOT Quadrant I - Strengths/Opportunities (SO)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     take advantage of your core strengths to aggressively pursue the     best opportunities at your disposal. This is particularly important     if the opportunities are short-lived. An example would be to utilize     a temporary competitive advantage to gain market share in your     business.\nSWOT Quadrant II - Strengths/Threats (ST)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     utilize your strengths to actively eliminate or reduce threats you     are facing.\nSWOT Quadrant III-Weaknesses/Opportunities (WO)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you open up opportunities down the road by working to     reduce some of your weaknesses (or making your strengths even     stronger). You can use this quadrant to help you prepare a long-term     improvement plan.\nSWOT Quadrant IV - Weaknesses/Threats (WT)\nThis quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you mitigate and avoid threats that could result from your     weaknesses. You could do this by eliminating the weaknesses and     turning them into strengths, or by developing defensive strategies     to reduce the likelihood or severity of the threat.\nSummary\nThe four SWOT quadrants provide different     perspectives to help you identify targets and strategies:\nSO Quadrant - Opportunities to Pursue\nST Quadrant - Threats to Eliminate\nWO Quadrant - Things to Improve\nWT Quadrant - Risk Mitigation & Avoidance\nOver the long term, you should include goals from     each of the four quadrants for balance. In the short term, you may     want to focus on one or two quadrants to take advantage of any     circumstances you are currently facing.\nSuccesses/Failures Analysis\nWhile SWOT analysis is a good way to examine you     current situation looking forward, it doesn't always reveal past     trends that you can learn from. A successes/failures analysis     complements the SWOT matrix and can give you more insight into your     strengths and weaknesses.\nYou start by listing all your successes and     achievements in this result area, followed by listing all your     failures or missteps. Once you've listed them, you can identify     additional strengths and weaknesses based on the trends that they     show you.\nQuestion:\nIn SWOT analysis used in business, for what does the 'S' stand?\nAnswer:\nSTRENGTHS, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats\nPassage:\nEndothermic process\nThe term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings; usually, but not always, in the form of heat. The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo-, derived from the word \"endon\" (\u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd) meaning \"within\" and the root \"therm\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc-) meaning \"hot.\" The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed. The opposite of an  endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases, \"gives out\" energy in the form of (usually, but not always) heat. Thus in each term (endothermic & exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs, though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes, without necessarily being in the form of heat.\n\nThe concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to, for example, chemical reactions, where thermal energy (heat) is converted to chemical bond energy.\n\nEndothermic (and exothermic) analysis only accounts for the enthalpy change (\u2206H) of a reaction. The full energy analysis of a reaction is the Gibbs free energy (\u2206G), which includes an entropy (\u2206S) and temperature term in addition to the enthalpy. A reaction will be a spontaneous process at a certain temperature if the products have a lower Gibbs free energy (an exergonic reaction) even if the enthalpy of the products is higher. Entropy and enthalpy are different terms, so the change in entropic energy can overcome an opposite change in enthalpic energy and make an endothermic reaction favorable.\n\nExamples\n\n* Photosynthesis\n* Melting ice\n* Evaporating liquid water\n* Sublimation of carbon dioxide (dry ice)\n* Cracking of alkanes\n* Thermal decomposition reactions\n* Electrolytic decomposition of sodium chloride into sodium hydroxide and hydrogen chloride \n* Dissolving ammonium chloride in water\n* Nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than nickel in stellar cores\n* High-energy neutrons can produce tritium from lithium-7 in an endothermic reaction, consuming 2.466 MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield.\n\n* Nuclear fusion of elements heavier than iron in supernovae\nQuestion:\nWhat is absorbed in an endothermic reaction?\nAnswer:\nHeat as energy\nPassage:\nBelgrade Theatre\nThe Belgrade Theatre is a live performance venue seating 858 and situated in Coventry, England. It was the first civic theatre to be built after the Second World War in Britain and as such was more than a place of entertainment. It joined the new Coventry Cathedral as a symbol of optimism and culture in one of the largest re-development projects then undertaken, to rebuild the city of Coventry, which had been almost totally destroyed by bombing. The building is now a grade II listed building. In 1963 the Belgrade was registered as a charity by the Charity Commission (number 219163). \nThe Belgrade acquired its name in recognition and thanks for a gift of timber from the Yugoslavian (today Serbian) capital city of Belgrade (Coventry's official sister city), that was used extensively in the construction of the auditorium. Since opening in 1958, the theatre has established itself as a centre for the new and innovative productions.\n\nHaving pioneered the Theatre-in-Education movement in the 1960s the theatre continues to work with disadvantaged young people and uses drama as a tool to develop personal and social skills. Their most successful programme \"Acting Out\" has been commissioned by Coventry's LEA for the last 10 years and has been replicated across the UK. One graduate of the course credits \"Acting Out\" with saving her life. \n\nThe theatre reopened in September 2007 after undergoing a \u00a312\u00a0million refurbishment with a 7-storey extension to provide a second auditorium.\n\nPrince Edward officially opened the refurbishment of the Belgrade's B2 studio on 5 February 2008, this also marked the 50th anniversary of the Belgrade's opening performed by Princess Alexandra.\nQuestion:\nIn which English city did the Belgrade Theatre open in 1958?\nAnswer:\nCofantre\nPassage:\nSomething Rotten\nSomething Rotten is the fourth\nbook in the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde.  It continues the story some two years after the point where The Well of Lost Plots leaves off.\n\nPlot introduction\n\nThe book sees Thursday return from the world of fiction to the alternative Swindon that Fforde introduced in The Eyre Affair; she is accompanied by Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, whose excursion from the world of fiction with Thursday forms the main sub-plot.\n\nThe title is taken from Hamlet I.iv:  \"Something is rotten in the State of Denmark\".\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947.  Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old.\n\nThursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him.  Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenberg cake, has some curious house guests:  Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos.  Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them.\n\nDespite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues.  She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the ageing English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike.\n\nThursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him.  On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\").  Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday.\n\nGoliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO\u2014at their headquarters in the Isle of Man\u2014and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness.  Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband.  Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilise. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly.\n\nOn top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy).\n\nShe succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.\nQuestion:\nWhich sport is played by the Reading Thwackers and the Swindon Mallets in the Jasper Fforde book \u2018Something Rotten\u2019?\nAnswer:\nCroquet mallet\nPassage:\nPresident George H. W. Bush - The White House | whitehouse.gov\nGeorge H. W. Bush | whitehouse.gov\nAir Force One\nGeorge H. W. Bush\nGeorge H. W. Bush, as the 41st President (1989-1993), brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States \"a kinder and gentler nation\" in the face of a dramatically changing world.\nGeorge Bush brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States \"a kinder and gentler nation.\" In his Inaugural Address he pledged in \"a moment rich with promise\" to use American strength as \"a force for good.\"\nComing from a family with a tradition of public service, George Herbert Walker Bush felt the responsibility to make his contribution both in time of war and in peace. Born in Milton, Massachusetts, on June 12, 1924, he became a student leader at Phillips Academy in Andover. On his 18th birthday he enlisted in the armed forces. The youngest pilot in the Navy when he received his wings, he flew 58 combat missions during World War II. On one mission over the Pacific as a torpedo bomber pilot he was shot down by Japanese antiaircraft fire and was rescued from the water by a U. S. submarine. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action.\nBush next turned his energies toward completing his education and raising a family. In January 1945 he married Barbara Pierce. They had six children-- George, Robin (who died as a child), John (known as Jeb), Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy.\nAt Yale University he excelled both in sports and in his studies; he was captain of the baseball team and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation Bush embarked on a career in the oil industry of West Texas.\nLike his father, Prescott Bush, who was elected a Senator from Connecticut in 1952, George became interested in public service and politics. He served two terms as a Representative to Congress from Texas. Twice he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate. Then he was appointed to a series of high-level positions: Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U. S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\nIn 1980 Bush campaigned for the Republican nomination for President. He lost, but was chosen as a running mate by Ronald Reagan. As Vice President, Bush had responsibility in several domestic areas, including Federal deregulation and anti-drug programs, and visited scores of foreign countries. In 1988 Bush won the Republican nomination for President and, with Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate, he defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the general election.\nBush faced a dramatically changing world, as the Cold War ended after 40 bitter years, the Communist empire broke up, and the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union ceased to exist; and reformist President Mikhail Gorbachev, whom Bush had supported, resigned. While Bush hailed the march of democracy, he insisted on restraint in U. S. policy toward the group of new nations.\nIn other areas of foreign policy, President Bush sent American troops into Panama to overthrow the corrupt regime of General Manuel Noriega, who was threatening the security of the canal and the Americans living there. Noriega was brought to the United States for trial as a drug trafficker.\nBush's greatest test came when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, then threatened to move into Saudi Arabia. Vowing to free Kuwait, Bush rallied the United Nations, the U. S. people, and Congress and sent 425,000 American troops. They were joined by 118,000 troops from allied nations. After weeks of air and missile bombardment, the 100-hour land battle dubbed Desert Storm routed Iraq's million-man army.\nDespite unprecedented popularity from this military and diplomatic triumph, Bush was unable to withstand discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending. In 1992 he lost his bid for reelection to Democrat William Clinton.\nThe Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from \u201cThe Presidents of the United States of America,\u201d by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey.

Six streets converge at the junction: Park Lane (from the north), Piccadilly (northeast), Constitution Hill (southeast), Grosvenor Place (south), Grosvenor Crescent (southwest) and Knightsbridge (west).\n\nHyde Park Corner tube station, a London Underground station served by the Piccadilly line, is located at the junction as well as a number of notable monuments.\n\nImmediately to the north of the junction is Apsley House, the home of the first Duke of Wellington, and several monuments to the Duke were erected in the vicinity in his lifetime and subsequently.\n\nEvolution and development \n\n \nIn the centre of the Hyde Park Corner traffic island stands the Wellington Arch (or Constitution Arch), designed by Decimus Burton and planned as a northern gate to the grounds of Buckingham Palace.  In execution, it was laid out as a gate into the Green Park and was originally sited directly opposite Burton's Ionic Screen (also known as the Hyde Park Corner Screen) which still provides a gate into Hyde Park.  Originally, the arch was topped with an equestrian statue of the Duke (by Matthew Cotes Wyatt).  \n\nBecause of traffic congestion, the arch was moved south and realigned to the axis of Constitution Hill in 1883. The boundary of Buckingham Palace's garden were moved south, and a new road named Duke of Wellington Place was created separating the space containing the arch from the rest of the Green Park. At this time the large equestrian statue was removed to Sandhurst.  It was subsequently replaced with the current work, entitled The Angel of Peace descending on the Quadriga of Victory, dated 1912, by the sculptor Adrian Jones. \n\nFollowing the passage of the Park Lane Improvement Act 1958, Park Lane was widened in the early 1960s.  For most of its length this was achieved by converting the former East Carriage Drive of Hyde Park into the northbund lanes of a dual carriageway, but at Hyde Park Corner, all lanes of traffic came together on a line immediately to the east of Apsley House that required demolition of houses on Piccadilly. This left Apsley House on an island site.  The InterContinental London hotel was subsequently built on the cleared site between the new route of Park Lane and Hamilton Place.\n\nAt part of the same scheme, a tunnel was constructed beneath the junction to allow traffic to flow freely between Knightsbridge and Piccadilly.   As a result, the area around the arch became a large traffic island, mostly laid to grass, and accessible only by pedestrian underpassess, and formally ceased to be part of the Green Park.\n\nSubsequent changes to the road layout in the 1990s reinstated a route between Hyde Park and the Green Park for pedestrians, cyclists and horseriders using surface level crossings.\n\nThe traffic island includes a smaller equestrian statue of Wellington by Edgar Boehm unveiled in 1888, the Machine Gun Corps Memorial, the Royal Artillery Memorial, the Australian War Memorial and the New Zealand War Memorial. \n\nOther monuments in the vicinity of Hyde Park Corner include  Adrian Jones's Monument to the Cavalry of the Empire (off the west side of Park Lane),  Alexander Munro's Boy and Dolphin statue (in a rose garden parallel to Rotten Row, going west from Hyde Park Corner), the Queen Elizabeth Gate (behind Apsley House), the Wellington Monument (off the west side of Park Lane), and a statue of Lord Byron (on a traffic island opposite the Wellington Monument).\n\nThe term is often erroneously used for Speakers' Corner, which is located at the north-eastern corner of Hyde Park.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n*The 1935 film Hyde Park Corner takes its name from the area, where it is set.\n*\"Hyde Park Corner\" was used as a codeword to announce to the government the death of King George VI in 1952. \n\nGallery of memorials\n\nFile:Australian War Memorial, Hyde Park Corner - geograph.org.uk - 1463114.jpg|Australian War Memorial\nFile:Byron Statue - geograph.org.uk - 1574255.jpg|Statue of Lord Byron\nFile:Statue of the Duke of Wellington - geograph.org.uk - 397832.jpg|Equestrian Statue of the Duke of Wellington\nFile:DavidLondon.JPG|Machine Gun Corps Memorial\nFile:NZ war memorial, London.JPG|New Zealand War Memorial\nFile:Royal Artillery Memorial, outside Aspley House, London.JPG|Royal Artillery Memorial\nQuestion:\nNamed after the 16/17th century fancy collar that made a fortune for Robert Baker, which London street starts at Hyde Park Corner and ends at a famous statue ?

Anatomy of seed plants. John Wiley and Sons, New York. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of Gaultheria procumbens or Syzygium jambos. Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, with much of the fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium.  Other example could be the anthocarps specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls).\n\nFruit with fleshy seeds, such as pomegranate or mamoncillo, are not considered to be accessory fruit.\n\nThe terms false fruit, spurious fruit, and pseudocarp are older terms for accessory fruit that have been criticized as \"inapt\", and are not used by botanists today.\nQuestion:\nPseudocarp relates to which type of crop?\nAnswer:\nFruiting\n", "answers": ["The Black Eyed Peas", "Yesterday (The Black Eyed Peas song)", "Black Eyed Peas", "Instant def", "The Black-Eyed Peas", "The black eyed peas", "Black Eyed Peas (band)", "TBEP", "Roots to Fruits", "Black eyed peas (band)", "Black-Eyed Peas", "Black Eyed Peas, The", "Black Eyed peas (group)", "Black eyed pees", "BLACK EYED PEAS", "Black-eyed Peas", "Yesterday (The Black Eyed Peas)", "Black Eye Peas"], "pred": "Check Out the Full PCM 2009 2029 2029 2029 2029 2029 2029 2029 2029", "length": 11494, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bf1556b2b68228cd71538d898121398f8e47fbaa45c6f717"}
{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nFatted calf\nFatted calf is a metaphor or symbol of festive celebration and rejoicing for someone's long-awaited return. It derives from the parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament.  In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal.  Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions.  Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father \"kills the fatted calf\" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.\n\nIn modern usage, \"killing the fatted calf\" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song \"Bennie and the Jets\".\nQuestion:\n\"In the Bible, whose return heralded the killing of \"\"the fatted calf\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nLoving Father\nPassage:\nKingdom of the Algarve\nThe Kingdom of the Algarve (Portuguese: Reino do Algarve, from the Arabic Gharb al-Andalus\u063a\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633), later the Kingdom of the Algarves (Portuguese: Reino dos Algarves), was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nIt was the second dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal, though in fact the Algarvian kingdom had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy. \nIn actuality, it was just an honorific title for the Algarve based on its history and was very similar to the rest of the Portuguese provinces. \n\nThe title King of Silves was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of Silves in 1189. As this conquest did not take all of the Algarve, D. Sancho never used the title King of Portugal and the Algarve, but instead it was adopted by his grandson Afonso III of Portugal as a part of the titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown.\n\nHistory\n\nReconquista\n\nDuring the Reconquista, Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to take lands from the Muslims that they claimed as theirs. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King Afonso III of Portugal.\n\nFirst conquest\n\nIn 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered Silves, one of the most prosperous cities in Al-Andalus, aligned at the time with the Almohad Caliphate. Portuguese control over Silves would be short, with the Almohads conquering the city again in 1191 in a massive counter-attack led by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur the Almohad Caliph in person.\n\nThe conquest of Algarve\n\nWith the decline of the Almohads, the southern taifa city-states united under a single Emir, M\u00fbs\u00e2 Ibn Muhammad Ibn Nassir Ibn Mahf\u00fbz, former governor of Niebla, and known among the Christians as Aben Mafom.\n\nAben Mafom, King of Niebla and Emir of Algarve, trying to counter the achievements made by the Portuguese in their territories, declared vassalage to Alfonso X of Castile (who thus titled himself the King of the Algarve). Through his vassals, Alfonso X hoped to claim dominion over the Algarve not yet conquered by the Portuguese. \n\nThe Emir's vow of vassalage to Castille however did not stop the knights of the Order of Santiago, under the command of the Grand-Master Paio Peres Correia, from conquering most of the region city by city, between 1242 and 1249, including Silves. In March 1249, King Afonso III of Portugal captured Faro, the last Muslim stronghold in Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista.\n\nThe entitlement of Afonso III of Portugal as King of Portugal and the Algarve would serve as a reaction to Alfonso X of Castile's claim to the Algarve and was designed to demonstrate the rights of the Portuguese monarch on the region concerned.\n\nThe issue between the sovereigns of Castille and Portugal was eventually settled by the Treaty of Badajoz (1267), where King Alfonso X gave up his claims of the Algarve, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne of the Algarve, which dictated the terms of its incorporation into the Portuguese crown. The treaty, though, allowed the use of the title of King of the Algarve for King Alfonso X and his descendants, since King Alfonso X had acquired the territories of Al-Gharb Al-Andalus on the other side of the Guadiana river. The kings of Castile, and then Spain, would add the title to their repertoire of titles until the ascent of Queen Isabel II of Spain to the throne.\n\nAge of Discoveries\n\nDuring the Age of Discoveries, the Algarve served as the location for the embarkment for many voyages, mainly those funded by the Infante D. Henrique. Prince Henry also set up his famous school of navigation at Sagres Point, though the idea of a real school building and campus is highly disputed. Most of the voyages set sail from Lagos.\n\nThe Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\n\nThe name of the Algarvian Kingdom suffered some minor changes due to the Portuguese North African conquests, which were considered an extension of the kingdom of Algarve. John I of Portugal added to the title of \"King of Portugal and the Algarve\", the title \"Lord of Ceuta\", and his grandson Afonso V of Portugal, in turn, styled himself \"Lord of Ceuta and Alcacer-Ceguer in Africa\" (after 1458). The 1471 conquest of Asilah, Tangiers and Larache, together with North African previous holdings, led to the creation of the title \"the Algarves from either side of the sea in Africa\", leaving the European Algarve to become \"the Algarve behind the sea.\"\n\nThus, it was not until 1471 that \"the Kingdom of the Algarve\" led to \"the Kingdom of the Algarves\", due to the increase of Portuguese possessions in Northern Africa, which were made as possessions of the Kingdom of the Algarve. The Portuguese monarchs therefore adopted the title that they would use until the fall of the monarchy in 1910: \"Kings of Portugal and the Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\". The title would continue to be used even after the abandonment of the last North African holding in Mazagan (Portuguese: Mazag\u00e3o; lost by Portugal in 1769).\n\n19th century conflicts\n\nDuring the 19th century, a serious clash between liberals and Miguelites, caused an exodus of people from the Algarvian inlands to the coastal cities. Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Sousa Reis, the Remexido, and fought in the inlands and attacked the coastal cities, bringing the urban population into turmoil. The turmoil of the Algarve intensified in the years between 1834 and 1838, when the Algarve saw battles on a level it had never seen before. On November 26, 1836, Miguel I of Portugal named Remexido Governor of the Kingdom of the Algarve and Acting Commander in Chief of all the Royalist Troops, Regular and Irregular Armies, and the Operations in the South. Remexido, however, was shot in Faro on August 2, 1838.\nQuestion:\n\"In which country is the area called \"\"the Algarve\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nPortoga\u0142o\nPassage:\nNanosecond\nA nanosecond (ns) is a SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (10 or 1/1,000,000,000 s). One nanosecond is to one second as one second is to 31.71\u00a0years.\n\nThe word nanosecond is formed by the prefix nano and the unit second. Its symbol is ns.\n\nA nanosecond is equal to 1000\u00a0picoseconds or \u00a0microsecond.  Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10 and 10 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds.\n\nTimes of this magnitude are commonly encountered in telecommunications, pulsed lasers and some areas of electronics.\n\nLight travels exactly 29.9792458 \u00a0centimeters in 1\u00a0nanosecond. This is equivalent to 11.8\u00a0inches, leading some to refer to a nanosecond as a light-foot.  A light-foot is actually ~1.0167033621639674471063578257196\u00a0nanoseconds. \nThe earliest use of the term is by George Gamow.  Another early reference commonly given  is to Admiral Grace Hopper, who used to give out pieces of wire about a foot long to illustrate the eventual problem of building very high speed computers.   If it takes light a nanosecond to go a foot (in a vacuum, slower in copper), then a computer built with parts connected by half this distance, 15 cm of wire, would take at least a nanosecond to send data to a part and get a response.  The solution, developed in Hopper's lifetime, was first the integrated circuit and later the multi-core processor.\n\n\"Once she presented a piece of wire about a foot long, and explained that it represented a nanosecond, since it was the maximum distance electricity could travel in wire in one-billionth of a second. She often contrasted this nanosecond with a microsecond - a coil of wire nearly a thousand feet long - as she encouraged programmers not to waste even a microsecond.\"\n\nCommon measurements \n\n* 0.5 nanoseconds (0.5\u00a0ns) \u2013 the average life of a molecule of positronium hydride\n* 1.0 nanosecond \u2013 cycle time for radio frequency 1\u00a0GHz (1 hertz), an inverse unit.

It is still used for special occasions.\n\nTo \"lay a h\u0101ngi\" or \"put down a h\u0101ngi\" involves digging a pit in the ground, heating stones in the pit with a large fire, placing baskets of food on top of the stones, and covering everything with earth for several hours before uncovering (or lifting) the h\u0101ngi. \n\nThere are many variations and details that can be altered. H\u0101ngi \"experts\" have developed and improved methods that often, like the stones themselves, have been handed down for generations. Another name sometimes used is umu, for instance the umu t\u012b, used in the South Island to cook Cabbage trees (Cordyline australis). \n\nThe evolution of h\u0101ngi methods \n\nEvidence from early Polynesian settler sites in New Zealand such as Wairau Bar and in coastal Otago Peninsula from about 1280 shows a significant number of large cooking pits or umu which were designed to cook Ti-pore or various species of Cordyline. This was a common east Polynesian practice in the Cook Islands and Society Islands. The remains of large umu have also been found in the Kermadec Islands. The .900 long, carrot shaped tap root was cooked in a large stone lined pit for between 1 and 2 days. Various sources say it was baked while some say steamed. The result was a fibrous mass of sweet pulp that had a bitter after taste. Investigation in Otago shows that most pits were used only once or perhaps twice before making a new pit. Some sources say the longer the cooking, the sweeter the pulp. This may have been due to the evaporation of the water content. The distinguishing feature of a Ti- pore was its large size compared to a normal cooking earth oven.  \nPrior to colonisation and the introduction of metals and wire, food was laid out on clean sticks, bark, large leaves and other vegetation to minimize direct contact with the hot rocks and reduce burning. Carved bowls and flat rocks were also used for this purpose.\nLeaves, sticks and vegetation were used to cover the food and to prevent crushing from the weight of the earth on top.\n\nMany different h\u0101ngi methods are now used. Wire baskets became widely used in the early 19th century with sacking and cloth replacing leaves and bark as the covering of choice. Red hot iron or steel may be used in addition to or instead of stones.\n\nIn the early 21st century, gas heated stainless steel \"h\u0101ngi machines\" are sometimes used to replicate the style of cooking without the need for a wood fire, rocks and a pit.\nQuestion:\nHangi is a traditional New Zealand Maori method of cooking using a?\nAnswer:\nPit\nPassage:\nPholadidae\nPholadidae, known as piddocks or angelwings, are a family of bivalve mollusc similar to a clam.\n\nBackground\n\nPidocks are unique in that each side of their shells is divided into 2 or 3 separate sections. Furthermore, one of the piddock's shells has a set of ridges or \"teeth\", which they use to grind away at clay or soft rock and create tubular burrows. The shape of these burrows is due to the rotating motion of the piddock as it grinds the rock to make its home. The piddock stays in the burrow it digs for the entirety of its eight-year lifespan, with only its siphon exposed to take in water that it filters for food. When the piddock dies and leaves an empty tubular burrow, other marine life such as sea anemone, crabs and other molluscs may use the burrow.\n\nSome species of Pholadidae may reach up to 18\u00a0cm (7\u2033). Their coloration is typically white, though through consumption of red tide algae some may develop a pink coloration.\n\n* The angelwing species Cyrtopleura costata has approximately 26 radiating ribs. Growth lines run horizontally over the surface of the shell. Angelwings have a spoon-shaped brace under the beak of the shell, called the apophysis, where the mollusc's foot muscles are attached. Cyrtopleura costata possesses long siphons which protrude from its burrow and circulate water as the source for its food supply. It cannot retract its siphons into the protection of its shell, so the two valves can never shut completely. The muscles fusing the shell's valves together are weak, making it rare to find angelwings with both halves still intact. Some shell hunters dig for the living clam, and if dug up, the fragile shell must be placed immediately into a container of water or it will close and shatter. The angelwing's shell is popular with collectors, as well as a delicious food staple. The angelwing lives offshore and in estuaries, sometimes as much as a metre (three feet) deep in the mud or clay.\n* The Atlantic mud-piddock, Barnea truncata, often referred to as the fallen angelwing, is classed among the angelwing varieties, growing up to 5.7\u00a0cm (2\u00bc\u2033) and is similar to other angelwings but with weaker sculpture. One end is squared off and the other end pointed. Loose accessory plates are located above the hinge on live specimens. It possesses a white exterior and interior. It burrows into mud, clay or softwood. Occasionally it is washed onto sounds and ocean beaches, and has a habitat range from Maine to Brazil. This fragile shell is rarely dug from mud without breaking. It burrows deeply and has long, united siphons.\n* The false angelwing Petricola pholadiformis, is also classed among varieties of angelwing, growing up to 7\u00a0cm (2\u00be\u2033). It has a thin, elongate shell resembling a small angelwing but lacks the rolled-out hinge area. Its beak is at one end of the shell with strong radial ribbing on the beak end. Teeth are located on hinge and a deep pallial sinus and partially united siphons. It has a white exterior and interior. It typically burrows into hard surfaces such as clay or peat in intertidal zones. It is commonly found on sounds and ocean beaches with a range from Canada to Uruguay.\n* The common piddock (Pholas dactylus) is known for its bioluminescence[http://www.marlin.ac.uk/species/Pholasdactylus.htm Basic information for Pholas dactylus (Common piddock)]  and was investigated by Rapha\u00ebl Dubois in his 1887 discovery of luciferin.\n\nGenera and selected species\n\n* Genus Barnea Risso, 1826\n** Barnea candida Linnaeus, 1758\n** Barnea fragilis\n** Barnea manilensis (Philippi, 1847)\n** Barnea parva Pennant, 1777\n** Barnea similis (Gray, 1835)\n** Barnea subtruncata (G.

It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. The site is in\nthe parish of Turners Puddle in Purbeck District.\n\nHistory\n\nThe small building has colourwashed brick walls and a tiled roof. It was probably built as forester's cottage in the early 19th century.  The lintel over the door now bears a Greek inscription \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 (\"Why Worry\"). It is now a Grade II* listed building as \"Clouds Hill (Lawrence of Arabia's Cottage)\"; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015. \n\nLawrence first rented the cottage in 1923 while stationed at nearby Bovington Camp with the Tank Corps.  He made it habitable with the help of a friend, then bought it in 1925 and used it as a holiday home. He described it as an earthly paradise and wrote \"Nothing in Clouds Hill is to be a care upon the world. While I have it there shall be nothing exquisite or unique in it. Nothing to anchor me.\" The cottage had no electric lights and three living rooms, described as an eating room, book room and music room. For heat insulation Lawrence had the eating room lined with asbestos that was covered in aluminium foil, and he kept his food under glass domes. In the book room he installed a large leather divan, and in the music room above it he had his gramophone \"with a huge amplifier horn\", a leather sofa and chair.\n\nIn 1935 Lawrence left the Royal Air Force and lived at Clouds Hill. A few weeks later, at the age of 46, he suffered severe head injuries in a motorcycle accident close to the cottage, and died in the Bovington Camp hospital on 19 May 1935. The following year, his heir, his brother A. W. Lawrence gave Clouds Hill to the National Trust. It is now a museum, dedicated to Lawrence. It is open to visitors from the end of March to the beginning of October, Thursday \u2013 Sunday.\n\nThe cottage remains largely as Lawrence left it at his death.  It features an exhibition detailing Lawrence's life, and most of his original furniture and possessions. The cottage reflects his complex personality and links to the Middle East.\n\nThe circular Lawrence of Arabia Trail starts and finishes at Bovington's The Tank Museum, taking in Clouds Hill and the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church in Moreton, Lawrence's final resting place. \n\nSleeping bags\n\nLawrence reserved a sleeping bag for guests and visitors who stayed overnight. In 1965 it was stolen. The bag's disappearance coincided with the release of Lawrence of Arabia, the film which popularised his story and it was thought the theft could have been inspired by the publicity and excitement generated by the film.\n\nIn 2001, the sleeping bag was returned. The Independent reported: \n\n\"The sleeping bag that served as a guest bed to some of the 20th century's most distinguished authors at TE Lawrence's weekend retreat has been returned 36 years after it was stolen. National Trust custodians of Clouds Hill, the author's cottage in Dorset, were amazed when a weather-beaten package from Belgium arrived containing the sleeping bag, along with a sheepish note that read: 'This is yours'. The bag, embroidered with the word 'tuum' ['yours'], was provided for guests at the cottage, while Lawrence slept on the floor in the other sleeping bag, marked 'meum' ['mine']. According to Jeremy Wilson, Lawrence's biographer, tuum's occupants included George Bernard Shaw, E. M.

Some versions are sculpted or slashed into a pattern resembling an ear of wheat.\n\nHistory and etymology\n\nIn ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flatbread baked in the ashes of the hearth (focus in Latin).  This became a diverse range of breads that include focaccia in Italian cuisine, hogaza in Spain, fogassa in Catalonia, fug\u00e0ssa in Ligurian, poga\u010da in the Balkans, pog\u00e1csa in Hungary, fougasse in Provence (originally spelled fogatza), fouace or fou\u00e9e in other French regions and on the Channel Islands.  The Provence version is more likely to have additions in the form of olives, cheese, or anchovies, which may be regarded as a primitive form of pizza without the tomato.\n\nThere is also in Portugal the foga\u00e7a, a sweet bread. In Brazil, p\u00e3o sovado is a typical big fougasse, while a recipe, typical of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Esp\u00edrito Santo and surrounding regions, that is halfway between fougasse and bolillo (in these regions known as p\u00e3o franc\u00eas or p\u00e3o-de-sal), somewhat resembling a savory small brioche, is called p\u00e3o su\u00ed\u00e7o. They are perhaps the sweetest of savory artisanal bread recipes commonly made in Brazil.\n\nFougasse was traditionally used to assess the temperature of a wood fired oven. The time it would take to bake gives an idea of the oven temperature and whether the rest of the bread can be loaded.\n\nFougasse is also a type of pastry from Monaco that is topped with almonds and nuts.\n\nUse in dishes\n\nIt is used to make the French version of calzone, which can have cheese and small squarish strips of bacon inside the pocket made by folding over the bread. Other variations include dried fruit, Roquefort and nuts or olives and goat cheese. It is known by extension as a fougasse even though it is more a sandwich than just a type of bread.\nQuestion:\nFougasse, associated with Provence, is what type of food?\nAnswer:\nSomun\nPassage:\nWaterborne diseases\nWaterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. Infection commonly results during bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food, or the consumption of food thus infected. Various forms of waterborne diarrheal disease probably are the most prominent examples, and affect mainly children in developing countries; according to the World Health Organization, such diseases account for an estimated 4.1% of the total DALY global burden of disease, and cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. \n\nOverview\n\nThe term \"waterborne disease\" is reserved largely for infections that predominantly are transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water. Trivially, many infections may be transmitted by microbes or parasites that accidentally, possibly as a result of exceptional circumstances, have entered the water, but the fact that there might be an occasional freak infection need not mean that it is useful to categorise the resulting disease as \"waterborne\". Nor is it common practice to refer to diseases such as malaria as \"waterborne\" just because mosquitoes have aquatic phases in their life cycles, or because treating the water they inhabit happens to be an effective strategy in control of the mosquitoes that are the vectors.\n\nMicroorganisms causing diseases that characteristically are waterborne prominently include protozoa and bacteria, many of which are intestinal parasites, or invade the tissues or circulatory system through walls of the digestive tract. Various other waterborne diseases are caused by viruses. (In spite of philosophical difficulties associated with defining viruses as \"organisms\", it is practical and convenient to regard them as microorganisms in this connection.)\n\nYet other important classes of water-borne diseases are caused by metazoan parasites. Typical examples include certain Nematoda, that is to say \"roundworms\". As an example of water-borne Nematode infections, one important waterborne nematodal disease is Dracunculiasis. It is acquired by swallowing water in which certain copepoda occur that act as vectors for the Nematoda. Anyone swallowing a copepod that happens to be infected with Nematode larvae in the genus Dracunculus, becomes liable to infection. The larvae cause guinea worm disease. \n\nAnother class of waterborne metazoan pathogens are certain members of the Schistosomatidae, a family of blood flukes. They usually infect victims that make skin contact with the water. Blood flukes are pathogens that cause Schistosomiasis of various forms, more or less seriously affecting hundreds of millions of people world-wide. \n\nLong before modern studies had established the germ theory of disease, or any advanced understanding of the nature of water as a vehicle for transmitting disease, traditional beliefs had cautioned against the consumption of water, rather favouring processed beverages such as beer, wine and tea. For example, in the camel caravans that crossed Central Asia along the Silk Road, the explorer Owen Lattimore noted, \"The reason we drank so much tea was because of the bad water. Water alone, unboiled, is never drunk. There is a superstition that it causes blisters on the feet.\" \n\nSocioeconomic impact\n\nWaterborne diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, locally as well as internationally. People who are infected by a waterborne disease are usually confronted with related costs and not seldom with a huge financial burden. This is especially the case in less developed countries. The financial losses are mostly caused by e.g. costs for medical treatment and medication, costs for transport, special food, and by the loss of manpower. Many families must even sell their land to pay for treatment in a proper hospital. On average, a family spends about 10% of the monthly households income per person infected. \n\nInfections by type of pathogen \n\nProtozoan \n\nParasitic \n\nBacterial \n\n*\n\nViral \n\n*\n\nAlgal \n\n*\nQuestion:\nThe devastating water-borne disease Schistosomiasis, or Snail Fever, is more commonly called what?\nAnswer:\nGenital schistosomiasis\nPassage:\nRochebaron\nRochebaron is a soft blue cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk, in the town of Beauzac in the Auvergne region, in the Massif Central, France.\n\nThis cheese is one of several that are made by curdling milk and separating the curds from the whey. Pressed into moulds, Rochebaron is then pierced with wires impregnated with Penicillium glaucum to produce blue veins through the soft whitish body of the cheese.

A Christian martyr is regarded as one who is put to death for his Christian faith or convictions. Confessors are people who died natural deaths. Date of Death: Saint Alban died in 305. Cause of Death - he was Beheaded.\u00a0\nHow Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art\nIt is helpful to be able to recognise Saint Alban in paintings, stained glass windows, illuminated manuscripts, architecture and other forms of Christian art. The artistic representations reflect the life or death of saints, or an aspect of life with which the person is most closely associated. Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art with a sword and a fountain.\nFeast Day of Saint Alban\nThe Feast Day of Saint Alban is June 22nd. The origin of Feast Days: most saints have specially designated feast days and are associated with a specific day of the year and these are referred to as the saint's feast day. The feast days first arose from the very early Christian custom of the annual commemoration of martyrs on the dates of their deaths at the same time celebrating their birth into heaven.\n\u00a0\nHistory, Life, Biography, Facts and Information about Saint Alban\nFast, concise facts and information about Saint Alban\nWhat is Saint Alban the patron of?\nDate of Death: 305\nQuestion:\nWho was the first English Christian martyr - his feast day is June 22nd.?\nAnswer:\nAlban, Saint\nPassage:\nWomen's Cricket World Cup\nThe ICC Women's Cricket World Cup is the premier international championship of women's One Day International cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was originally administered by the International Women's Cricket Council until the two associations merged in 2005. The first tournament was held in England in 1973, two years before the first men's tournament.\n\nParticipation in the tournament has varied through the eight competitions: fifteen different teams have played, but only Australia, England and New Zealand have appeared in every tournament. India have appeared in all but two of the competitions. Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Young England have all appeared in just one tournament: in each case, the first competition, in 1973.\n\nThe most recent tournament, the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, was held in India for the third time in February. In the final Australia beat West Indies by 114 runs at the Brabourne Stadium.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst World Cup\n\nWomen's international cricket was first played in 1934, when a party from England toured Australia and New Zealand. The first Test match was played on 28\u201331 December 1934, and was won by England.  The first Test against New Zealand followed early the following year. These three nations remained the only Test playing teams in women's cricket until 1960, when South Africa played a number of matches against England. Limited overs cricket was first played by first-class teams in England in 1962.  Nine years later, the first international one day match was played in men's cricket, when England took on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. \n\nTalks began in 1971 about holding a World Cup for women's cricket, led by Jack Hayward.  South Africa, under pressure from the world for their apartheid laws, were not invited to take part in the competition.  Both of the other two Test playing nations, Australia and New Zealand were invited. Hayward had previously organised tours of the West Indies by England women, and it was from this region that the other two competing nations were drawn; Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago. To make up the numbers, England also fielded a \"Young England\" team, and an \"International XI\" was also included. Five South Africans were invited to play for the International XI as a means of compensation for the team not being invited, but these invitations were later withdrawn.\n\nThe inaugural tournament was held at a variety of venues across England in June and July 1973,  two years before the first men's Cricket World Cup was played.  The competition was played as a round-robin tournament, and the last scheduled match was England against Australia. Australia went into the game leading the table by a solitary point: they had won four matches and had one abandoned. England had also won four matches, but they had lost to New Zealand.  As a result, the match also served as a de facto final for the competition. England won the match, held at Edgbaston, Birmingham by 92 runs to win the tournament. \n\nResults\n\nBy year\n\nBy team\n\n;Legend\n* \u2013 Champions\n* \u2013 Runners-up\n* \u2013 Third place\n* \u2013 Losing semi-finalist (no third-place playoff)\n*QF \u2013 Losing quarter-finalist (no further playoffs)\n*1R \u2013 First round\n*\u00a0\u2014 Hosts\n\nRecords\nQuestion:\nWho won the Women's Cricket World Cup played at Sydney, Australia, in 2009?\nAnswer:\nEnglnad\nPassage:\nMen's Fastest Mile Times (World Records) - About.com Sports\nWorld Records for Men's Fastest Mile Times\nBy Mike Rosenbaum\nUpdated September 23, 2016.\nIt\u2019s never been an Olympic or World Championship event, yet the mile remains the only non-metric race distance in which the IAAF recognizes a world record. Long after the other non-metric distances have vanished from the world record books, those 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards \u2013 or about 1.61 kilometers \u2013 continue to capture the imaginations of runners and fans alike as a premier middle distance event.\nThe first IAAF-recognized world record in the mile was run by John Paul Jones of the U.S. No, the record doesn\u2019t go back to the American Revolution. This John Paul Jones performed his feat on May 31, 1913, in Allston, Mass., where he completed the mile in 4:14.4. France\u2019s Jules Ladoumegue later brought the mark under 4:10, running 4:09.2 on Oct. 4, 1931, in Paris. The mark crept down toward the 4-minute mark throughout the 1940s. In a 3-year period from July 1942 through July 1945 a pair of Swedes, Gunder Hagg, and Arne Andersson, exchanged the record six times.\ncontinue reading below our video\nUnderstanding Baseball\nHagg ended the give-and-take with a time of 4:01.4 on July 17, 1945. His mark stood for almost nine years, during which time the pundits debated on whether a 4-minute mile was humanly possible, as a runner after runner tried and failed to crack a key psychological \u2013 and, as some believed, physical \u2013 barrier.\nThe 4-Minute Mile:\nOn May 6, 1954, great Britain\u2019s Roger Bannister answered the questions by running the first sub-4:00 miles, finishing in 3:59.4 while assisted by a pair of pacemakers. Bannister, then a medical student, developed his own training methods \u2013 featuring relatively short, intense workouts \u2013 that carried him through on a windy day. Bannister ran lap times of 57.5, 60.7, 62.3 and 58.9 seconds. He was timed in 3:43.0 through 1500 meters.\nWhile Bannister is famous for shattering the 4-minute barrier, many forget that he held the title for less than seven weeks before Australia\u2019s John Landy finished in 3:58.0 on June 21, 1954. Bannister retired from racing before the end of the year, to devote himself to medicine, but not before racing against Landy in \u201cThe Mile of the Century\u201d in Vancouver that August. Landy shot in front by the end of the first lap, hoping to wear out the normally fast-finishing Bannister. But Bannister ran his own race, paced himself, then shot into the lead with less than 90 yards remaining to win in 3:58.8 to Landy\u2019s 3:59.6, the first time two runners topped four minutes in the same race.\nIn 1958 Australia\u2019s Herb Elliott ran 3:54.5 to break the record set the previous year by Derek Ibbotson by 2.7 seconds, the biggest drop in the world record time during the IAAF era.\nThe record returned to U.S. soil in 1966 when the precocious Jim Ryun posted a 3:51.3 time, which he lowered to 3:51.1 the following year. Ryun was the first high school runner to break four minutes, with a time of 3:59 in 1964. At age 18 he owned the U.S. mile record of 3:55.3. At 19 he owned the world record. He was the fourth and, as of 2012, the last American to reign as the mile\u2019s world record-holder.\nJohn Walker Cracks 3:50:\nNew Zealand\u2019s John Walker took the record below 3:50 in August 1975 with a time of 3:49.4, fulfilling his promise to the organizers of the meet held in Goteborg, Sweden. Walker convinced meet officials to change the scheduled 1500-meter race to the mile, telling them he\u2019d take a shot at the world record. He was paced through the first half mile, with lap times of 55.8 and 59.3, then sped up on the final two laps, running the third quarter in 57.9 and the fourth in 56.4 seconds. Walker eventually became the first man to run 100 sub-4:00 miles.\nGreat Britain then enjoyed a stretch of 14 years in which three different British runners owned the mark. Just as Hagg and Andersson played give-and-go with the record in the \u201840s, so too did Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett in 1979-81. In a 25-month stretch, beginning in July 1979 when Coe edged Walker\u2019s mark by four-tenths of a second, Coe owned the record three times and Ovett twice. Coe began the British siege in only the third-mile race of his life, in an Oslo meet in which Walker participated. Coe finally prevailed in his duel with Ovett, as Coe\u2019s time of 3:47.33 set in August of 1981 lived for almost four years before Steve Cram lowered it to 3:46.32 in 1985.\nEl Guerrouj Takes Charge:\nOnly one African runner \u2013 Filbert Bayi, who broke Ryun\u2019s record and held the mile mark for just three months \u2013 had owned the mile record before Algeria\u2019s Noureddine Morceli topped Cram\u2019s mark by running 3:44.39 on Sept. 5, 1993. The 1.93-second drop in the record was the largest margin since Ryun set his first record in 1966. Morocco\u2019s Hicham El Guerrouj then lowered the mark to 3:43.13 on July 7, 1999 \u2013 almost identical to Bannister\u2019s 1500-meter time in 1954 \u2013 yet came close to losing the race, held in Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium. Noah Ngeny ran with El Guerrouj all the way and edged Morceli\u2019s record as well, finishing in 3:43.40. With his mark still intact in 2015, El Guerrouj has held the IAAF mile record longer than anyone else, while Ngeny\u2019s time remained No. 2 on the all-time list. As of 2015, El Guerrouj had seven of the top 10 mile times in history; Alan Webb owns the fastest mile of the 21st century by someone other than El Guerrouj, posting a time of 3:46.91 in 2007.\nRead more about:\nQuestion:\nWho was the first man to break three and a half minutes for the 1500 metres\nAnswer:\nStephen Cram\nPassage:\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer ...\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\n* Premier League leads way as soccer clubs splash TV cash\n* Real Madrid and Barcelona defy Spain's economic downturn\n* Clubs seen complying with UEFA rules despite investment\nBy Keith Weir\nLONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European soccer clubs have reinvested cash from television deals to go on a record-breaking summer spending spree led by teams from the English Premier League and Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.\nClubs in the English top flight had spent 630 million pounds ($980.5 million) by the player transfer deadline on Monday night. Teams in the big European leagues must now wait until January before they can hire new players.\nThe spending by English clubs broke the 2008 record of 500 million pounds, according to figures compiled by business services group Deloitte, and underlined the Premier League's status as the world's richest national competition.\n\"As the financial rewards for participation and success in the Premier League increase, so it follows that clubs are investing on the pitch to ensure they continue to benefit from the remarkable Premier League growth story,\" Deloitte's Dan Jones said.\nChampions Manchester United and the other 19 Premier League teams are expected to share revenues of about 1.6 billion pounds this season thanks to enhanced television deals with BSkyB and BT in Britain, and broadcasters around the globe that began last month.\nIt was not all one-way traffic as the Premier League lost one of its biggest names when Real Madrid bought Welshman Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur for a world record 100 million euros ($132 million).\nNot to be outdone, Real's perennial rivals Barcelona spent $75 million to buy Brazil forward Neymar from Brazilian top division club Santos.\nPLAYING FAIR?\nSpending such sums might appear to defy logic given Spain's economic problems but Real and Barcelona enjoy the luxury of doing their own TV deals rather than pooling revenues as happens in England and other major leagues.\nThat has made the two clubs the world's richest in terms of revenues and allowed them to remain buyers when many of their Spanish rivals are forced to sell their best players.\nReal and Barcelona have TV deals with Spanish production and distribution company Mediapro. They both also have lucrative new main sponsorship deals this season - Barcelona with Qatar Airways and Real with the Emirates airline names on their kit.\nOverall spending levels may also raise eyebrows when loss-making clubs are supposed to be complying with new Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA, European soccer's governing body, to put soccer on a more stable footing.\n\"A lot of English clubs have gone on a spending spree but they haven't breached the Financial Fair Play rules as they are only spending what they have earned,\" said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports business at England's Coventry University.\nClubs also have the advantage of spreading the cost of a player's transfer over the duration of his contract in their accounts, lessening the impact on the bottom line.\nMany clubs also offload players to help fund spending.\nReal Madrid are a case in point - recouping half of what they paid for Bale by selling German international Mesut Ozil to Premier League Arsenal.\nIndeed, the total invested by Premier League clubs comes down to 400 million pounds when proceeds from sales such as that of Bale are factored in.\nSpanish clubs actually generated a surplus of 95 million pounds from player trading this summer, according to Deloitte, while clubs from Italy's cash-strapped Serie A also posted a small profit.\nReblog\nQuestion:\nAccording to a survey carried out by Deloittes early in 2009, which was the world's richest soccer club at that time?\nAnswer:\nReal madrid cf\nPassage:\nRoyal Parks of London\nThe Royal Parks of London are lands originally owned by the monarchy of the United Kingdom for the recreation (mostly hunting) of the royal family. They are part of the hereditary possessions of The Crown.\n\nParks\n\nWith increasing urbanisation of London, some of these were preserved as freely accessible open space and became public parks with the introduction of the Crown Lands Act 1851. There are today eight parks formally described by this name and they cover almost  2000 ha of land in Greater London.\n\n* Bushy Park, 445 ha  \n* Green Park, 19 ha  \n* Greenwich Park, 74 ha  \n* Hyde Park, 142 ha  \n* Kensington Gardens, 111 ha  \n* Regent's Park, 166 ha  \n* Richmond Park, 955 hectares   (2360 acre)\n* St. James's Park, 23 ha  \n\nHyde Park and Kensington Gardens (which are adjacent), Green Park, Regent's Park and St James's Park are the largest green spaces in central London. Bushy Park, Greenwich Park and Richmond Park are in the suburbs. The Royal Parks agency also manages Brompton Cemetery, Grosvenor Square Gardens, Victoria Tower Gardens and the gardens of 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street. \n\nHampton Court Park is also a royal park within Greater London, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks. \n\nLegal position\n\nThe public does not have any legal right to use the Parks, as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, although there are public rights of way across the land. The Royal Parks Agency manages the Royal Parks under powers derived from section 22 of the Crown Lands Act 1851. As part of its statutory management function the Agency permits the public to use the Parks for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under the Parks Regulation Acts 1872\u20131926 which are considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within the Parks. The current regulations are the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.\n\nManagement\n\nThey are managed by The Royal Parks (an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and are policed by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing the parks, the Royal Parks Constabulary, has been abolished). The main form of funding for the Royal Parks is a central government grant. This contrasts with most of London's other parks, which are funded by local borough councils. The Royal Parks generate additional income from commercial activities such as catering and staging public events such as concerts.\n\nThe Royal Parks Foundation is a registered charity which raises funds to protect, support and create new opportunities within the Parks. They have a number of membership schemes such as adoption and champion programmes.\n\nMayoral control\n\nIn 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that control over the Royal Parks should be devolved to the Greater London Authority  and the government put forward proposals for that to happen later on that year.  The plan was welcomed by Royal Parks but it is yet to be implemented following the 2012 London Olympic games.\nQuestion:\nIf the eight Royal Parks in London are arranged alphabetically which comes last?\nAnswer:\nSt. James's\nPassage:\nDrawing pin\nA thumb tack (North American English) or push pin is a short nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and intended to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are used to refer to different designs intended for various purpose. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively.  These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation.  Drawing pin or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on drawing boards. Map pin or map tack refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations on a map and to hold the map in place.\n\nHistory\n\nEdwin Moore invented the \"push-pin\" in 1900 and founded the Moore Push-Pin Company. Moore described the push-pin as a pin with a handle.  Later, in 1904, in Lychen, German clockmaker Johann Kirsten invented flat-headed thumb tacks for use with drawings. \n\nDesign\n\nA thumb tack has two basic components: the head, often made of plastic, metal or  wood, and the body, usually made of steel or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the tack in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as hearts or stars. Thumb tack heads also come in a variety of colors. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some thumb tack designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a tack.\n\nDomed or gripped heads are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed tacks will point upward, posing a hazard.  Thumb tacks also pose a hazard of ingestion and choking, where they may do serious harm.\nQuestion:\nWhat do we call what the Americans call a thumb tack?\nAnswer:\nMap pin\n\n\nPassage:\nThe Story Behind Sammy Hagar\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Drive 55\u2033\nThe Story Behind Sammy Hagar\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Drive 55\u2033\nThe Story Behind Sammy Hagar\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Drive 55\u2033\nBy John Robinson June 16, 2015 1:44 PM\n\u00a0\nCourtesy of Geffen Records\nQ: Did Sammy Hagar do the song I CAN\u2019T DRIVE 55 because he got stopped by the cops so many times?\nA: The song was based on an incident that happened to Sammy while he was driving from Albany, New York to Lake Placid.

It derives from the parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament.  In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal.  Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions.  Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father \"kills the fatted calf\" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.\n\nIn modern usage, \"killing the fatted calf\" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song \"Bennie and the Jets\".\nQuestion:\n\"In the Bible, whose return heralded the killing of \"\"the fatted calf\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nLoving Father\nPassage:\nKingdom of the Algarve\nThe Kingdom of the Algarve (Portuguese: Reino do Algarve, from the Arabic Gharb al-Andalus\u063a\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633), later the Kingdom of the Algarves (Portuguese: Reino dos Algarves), was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nIt was the second dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal, though in fact the Algarvian kingdom had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy. \nIn actuality, it was just an honorific title for the Algarve based on its history and was very similar to the rest of the Portuguese provinces. \n\nThe title King of Silves was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of Silves in 1189. As this conquest did not take all of the Algarve, D. Sancho never used the title King of Portugal and the Algarve, but instead it was adopted by his grandson Afonso III of Portugal as a part of the titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown.\n\nHistory\n\nReconquista\n\nDuring the Reconquista, Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to take lands from the Muslims that they claimed as theirs. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King Afonso III of Portugal.\n\nFirst conquest\n\nIn 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered Silves, one of the most prosperous cities in Al-Andalus, aligned at the time with the Almohad Caliphate. Portuguese control over Silves would be short, with the Almohads conquering the city again in 1191 in a massive counter-attack led by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur the Almohad Caliph in person.\n\nThe conquest of Algarve\n\nWith the decline of the Almohads, the southern taifa city-states united under a single Emir, M\u00fbs\u00e2 Ibn Muhammad Ibn Nassir Ibn Mahf\u00fbz, former governor of Niebla, and known among the Christians as Aben Mafom.\n\nAben Mafom, King of Niebla and Emir of Algarve, trying to counter the achievements made by the Portuguese in their territories, declared vassalage to Alfonso X of Castile (who thus titled himself the King of the Algarve). Through his vassals, Alfonso X hoped to claim dominion over the Algarve not yet conquered by the Portuguese. \n\nThe Emir's vow of vassalage to Castille however did not stop the knights of the Order of Santiago, under the command of the Grand-Master Paio Peres Correia, from conquering most of the region city by city, between 1242 and 1249, including Silves. In March 1249, King Afonso III of Portugal captured Faro, the last Muslim stronghold in Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista.\n\nThe entitlement of Afonso III of Portugal as King of Portugal and the Algarve would serve as a reaction to Alfonso X of Castile's claim to the Algarve and was designed to demonstrate the rights of the Portuguese monarch on the region concerned.\n\nThe issue between the sovereigns of Castille and Portugal was eventually settled by the Treaty of Badajoz (1267), where King Alfonso X gave up his claims of the Algarve, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne of the Algarve, which dictated the terms of its incorporation into the Portuguese crown. The treaty, though, allowed the use of the title of King of the Algarve for King Alfonso X and his descendants, since King Alfonso X had acquired the territories of Al-Gharb Al-Andalus on the other side of the Guadiana river. The kings of Castile, and then Spain, would add the title to their repertoire of titles until the ascent of Queen Isabel II of Spain to the throne.\n\nAge of Discoveries\n\nDuring the Age of Discoveries, the Algarve served as the location for the embarkment for many voyages, mainly those funded by the Infante D. Henrique. Prince Henry also set up his famous school of navigation at Sagres Point, though the idea of a real school building and campus is highly disputed. Most of the voyages set sail from Lagos.\n\nThe Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\n\nThe name of the Algarvian Kingdom suffered some minor changes due to the Portuguese North African conquests, which were considered an extension of the kingdom of Algarve. John I of Portugal added to the title of \"King of Portugal and the Algarve\", the title \"Lord of Ceuta\", and his grandson Afonso V of Portugal, in turn, styled himself \"Lord of Ceuta and Alcacer-Ceguer in Africa\" (after 1458). The 1471 conquest of Asilah, Tangiers and Larache, together with North African previous holdings, led to the creation of the title \"the Algarves from either side of the sea in Africa\", leaving the European Algarve to become \"the Algarve behind the sea.\"\n\nThus, it was not until 1471 that \"the Kingdom of the Algarve\" led to \"the Kingdom of the Algarves\", due to the increase of Portuguese possessions in Northern Africa, which were made as possessions of the Kingdom of the Algarve. The Portuguese monarchs therefore adopted the title that they would use until the fall of the monarchy in 1910: \"Kings of Portugal and the Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\". The title would continue to be used even after the abandonment of the last North African holding in Mazagan (Portuguese: Mazag\u00e3o; lost by Portugal in 1769).\n\n19th century conflicts\n\nDuring the 19th century, a serious clash between liberals and Miguelites, caused an exodus of people from the Algarvian inlands to the coastal cities. Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Sousa Reis, the Remexido, and fought in the inlands and attacked the coastal cities, bringing the urban population into turmoil. The turmoil of the Algarve intensified in the years between 1834 and 1838, when the Algarve saw battles on a level it had never seen before. On November 26, 1836, Miguel I of Portugal named Remexido Governor of the Kingdom of the Algarve and Acting Commander in Chief of all the Royalist Troops, Regular and Irregular Armies, and the Operations in the South. Remexido, however, was shot in Faro on August 2, 1838.\nQuestion:\n\"In which country is the area called \"\"the Algarve\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nPortoga\u0142o\nPassage:\nNanosecond\nA nanosecond (ns) is a SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (10 or 1/1,000,000,000 s). One nanosecond is to one second as one second is to 31.71\u00a0years.\n\nThe word nanosecond is formed by the prefix nano and the unit second. Its symbol is ns.\n\nA nanosecond is equal to 1000\u00a0picoseconds or \u00a0microsecond.  Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10 and 10 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds.\n\nTimes of this magnitude are commonly encountered in telecommunications, pulsed lasers and some areas of electronics.\n\nLight travels exactly 29.9792458 \u00a0centimeters in 1\u00a0nanosecond. This is equivalent to 11.8\u00a0inches, leading some to refer to a nanosecond as a light-foot.  A light-foot is actually ~1.0167033621639674471063578257196\u00a0nanoseconds. \nThe earliest use of the term is by George Gamow.  Another early reference commonly given  is to Admiral Grace Hopper, who used to give out pieces of wire about a foot long to illustrate the eventual problem of building very high speed computers.   If it takes light a nanosecond to go a foot (in a vacuum, slower in copper), then a computer built with parts connected by half this distance, 15 cm of wire, would take at least a nanosecond to send data to a part and get a response.  The solution, developed in Hopper's lifetime, was first the integrated circuit and later the multi-core processor.\n\n\"Once she presented a piece of wire about a foot long, and explained that it represented a nanosecond, since it was the maximum distance electricity could travel in wire in one-billionth of a second. She often contrasted this nanosecond with a microsecond - a coil of wire nearly a thousand feet long - as she encouraged programmers not to waste even a microsecond.\"\n\nCommon measurements \n\n* 0.5 nanoseconds (0.5\u00a0ns) \u2013 the average life of a molecule of positronium hydride\n* 1.0 nanosecond \u2013 cycle time for radio frequency 1\u00a0GHz (1 hertz), an inverse unit.

It is still used for special occasions.\n\nTo \"lay a h\u0101ngi\" or \"put down a h\u0101ngi\" involves digging a pit in the ground, heating stones in the pit with a large fire, placing baskets of food on top of the stones, and covering everything with earth for several hours before uncovering (or lifting) the h\u0101ngi. \n\nThere are many variations and details that can be altered. H\u0101ngi \"experts\" have developed and improved methods that often, like the stones themselves, have been handed down for generations. Another name sometimes used is umu, for instance the umu t\u012b, used in the South Island to cook Cabbage trees (Cordyline australis). \n\nThe evolution of h\u0101ngi methods \n\nEvidence from early Polynesian settler sites in New Zealand such as Wairau Bar and in coastal Otago Peninsula from about 1280 shows a significant number of large cooking pits or umu which were designed to cook Ti-pore or various species of Cordyline. This was a common east Polynesian practice in the Cook Islands and Society Islands. The remains of large umu have also been found in the Kermadec Islands. The .900 long, carrot shaped tap root was cooked in a large stone lined pit for between 1 and 2 days. Various sources say it was baked while some say steamed. The result was a fibrous mass of sweet pulp that had a bitter after taste. Investigation in Otago shows that most pits were used only once or perhaps twice before making a new pit. Some sources say the longer the cooking, the sweeter the pulp. This may have been due to the evaporation of the water content. The distinguishing feature of a Ti- pore was its large size compared to a normal cooking earth oven.  \nPrior to colonisation and the introduction of metals and wire, food was laid out on clean sticks, bark, large leaves and other vegetation to minimize direct contact with the hot rocks and reduce burning. Carved bowls and flat rocks were also used for this purpose.\nLeaves, sticks and vegetation were used to cover the food and to prevent crushing from the weight of the earth on top.\n\nMany different h\u0101ngi methods are now used. Wire baskets became widely used in the early 19th century with sacking and cloth replacing leaves and bark as the covering of choice. Red hot iron or steel may be used in addition to or instead of stones.\n\nIn the early 21st century, gas heated stainless steel \"h\u0101ngi machines\" are sometimes used to replicate the style of cooking without the need for a wood fire, rocks and a pit.\nQuestion:\nHangi is a traditional New Zealand Maori method of cooking using a?\nAnswer:\nPit\nPassage:\nPholadidae\nPholadidae, known as piddocks or angelwings, are a family of bivalve mollusc similar to a clam.\n\nBackground\n\nPidocks are unique in that each side of their shells is divided into 2 or 3 separate sections. Furthermore, one of the piddock's shells has a set of ridges or \"teeth\", which they use to grind away at clay or soft rock and create tubular burrows. The shape of these burrows is due to the rotating motion of the piddock as it grinds the rock to make its home. The piddock stays in the burrow it digs for the entirety of its eight-year lifespan, with only its siphon exposed to take in water that it filters for food. When the piddock dies and leaves an empty tubular burrow, other marine life such as sea anemone, crabs and other molluscs may use the burrow.\n\nSome species of Pholadidae may reach up to 18\u00a0cm (7\u2033). Their coloration is typically white, though through consumption of red tide algae some may develop a pink coloration.\n\n* The angelwing species Cyrtopleura costata has approximately 26 radiating ribs. Growth lines run horizontally over the surface of the shell. Angelwings have a spoon-shaped brace under the beak of the shell, called the apophysis, where the mollusc's foot muscles are attached. Cyrtopleura costata possesses long siphons which protrude from its burrow and circulate water as the source for its food supply. It cannot retract its siphons into the protection of its shell, so the two valves can never shut completely. The muscles fusing the shell's valves together are weak, making it rare to find angelwings with both halves still intact. Some shell hunters dig for the living clam, and if dug up, the fragile shell must be placed immediately into a container of water or it will close and shatter. The angelwing's shell is popular with collectors, as well as a delicious food staple. The angelwing lives offshore and in estuaries, sometimes as much as a metre (three feet) deep in the mud or clay.\n* The Atlantic mud-piddock, Barnea truncata, often referred to as the fallen angelwing, is classed among the angelwing varieties, growing up to 5.7\u00a0cm (2\u00bc\u2033) and is similar to other angelwings but with weaker sculpture. One end is squared off and the other end pointed. Loose accessory plates are located above the hinge on live specimens. It possesses a white exterior and interior. It burrows into mud, clay or softwood. Occasionally it is washed onto sounds and ocean beaches, and has a habitat range from Maine to Brazil. This fragile shell is rarely dug from mud without breaking. It burrows deeply and has long, united siphons.\n* The false angelwing Petricola pholadiformis, is also classed among varieties of angelwing, growing up to 7\u00a0cm (2\u00be\u2033). It has a thin, elongate shell resembling a small angelwing but lacks the rolled-out hinge area. Its beak is at one end of the shell with strong radial ribbing on the beak end. Teeth are located on hinge and a deep pallial sinus and partially united siphons. It has a white exterior and interior. It typically burrows into hard surfaces such as clay or peat in intertidal zones. It is commonly found on sounds and ocean beaches with a range from Canada to Uruguay.\n* The common piddock (Pholas dactylus) is known for its bioluminescence[http://www.marlin.ac.uk/species/Pholasdactylus.htm Basic information for Pholas dactylus (Common piddock)]  and was investigated by Rapha\u00ebl Dubois in his 1887 discovery of luciferin.\n\nGenera and selected species\n\n* Genus Barnea Risso, 1826\n** Barnea candida Linnaeus, 1758\n** Barnea fragilis\n** Barnea manilensis (Philippi, 1847)\n** Barnea parva Pennant, 1777\n** Barnea similis (Gray, 1835)\n** Barnea subtruncata (G.

The great thing about a watch is that you can incorporate different gems with it.\u00a0 Whether it is a diamond or ruby studded watch or a Mickey Mouse watch, it can bring a sense of tradition to your anniversary celebration.\nGEMSTONE:Rubies are the second hardest gemstone only to a diamond. Rubies can range in color from orange-red to purple-red. The more red a ruby is the more sought after the stone is. As far back as ancient times the ruby has been thought to enable people to predict the future as well as stop bleeding. More recently, rubies were used to make the first laser. Rubies are an alternative to diamonds when it comes to engagement rings. When worn on the left hand, rubies are said to bring good luck.\nFLOWER: The rose is the flower associated with the 15th anniversary. Red roses are the traditional bouquet given to symbolize love. Red roses stand for love and deep passion, lavender roses stand for majesty, white \u00a0for purity or innocence and orange roses stand for energy and fascination.\u00a0 Whether it is a full bouquet or a single red rose, this lovely flower can add an elegant touch to your 15th wedding anniversary.\nQuestion:\nWhat gift is traditionally given on a fifteenth wedding anniversary\nAnswer:\n18k Gold Watch\nPassage:\nClouds Hill\nClouds Hill is an isolated cottage near Wareham in the county of Dorset in South West England. It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. The site is in\nthe parish of Turners Puddle in Purbeck District.\n\nHistory\n\nThe small building has colourwashed brick walls and a tiled roof. It was probably built as forester's cottage in the early 19th century.  The lintel over the door now bears a Greek inscription \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 (\"Why Worry\"). It is now a Grade II* listed building as \"Clouds Hill (Lawrence of Arabia's Cottage)\"; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015. \n\nLawrence first rented the cottage in 1923 while stationed at nearby Bovington Camp with the Tank Corps.  He made it habitable with the help of a friend, then bought it in 1925 and used it as a holiday home. He described it as an earthly paradise and wrote \"Nothing in Clouds Hill is to be a care upon the world. While I have it there shall be nothing exquisite or unique in it. Nothing to anchor me.\" The cottage had no electric lights and three living rooms, described as an eating room, book room and music room. For heat insulation Lawrence had the eating room lined with asbestos that was covered in aluminium foil, and he kept his food under glass domes. In the book room he installed a large leather divan, and in the music room above it he had his gramophone \"with a huge amplifier horn\", a leather sofa and chair.\n\nIn 1935 Lawrence left the Royal Air Force and lived at Clouds Hill. A few weeks later, at the age of 46, he suffered severe head injuries in a motorcycle accident close to the cottage, and died in the Bovington Camp hospital on 19 May 1935. The following year, his heir, his brother A. W. Lawrence gave Clouds Hill to the National Trust. It is now a museum, dedicated to Lawrence. It is open to visitors from the end of March to the beginning of October, Thursday \u2013 Sunday.\n\nThe cottage remains largely as Lawrence left it at his death.  It features an exhibition detailing Lawrence's life, and most of his original furniture and possessions. The cottage reflects his complex personality and links to the Middle East.\n\nThe circular Lawrence of Arabia Trail starts and finishes at Bovington's The Tank Museum, taking in Clouds Hill and the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church in Moreton, Lawrence's final resting place. \n\nSleeping bags\n\nLawrence reserved a sleeping bag for guests and visitors who stayed overnight. In 1965 it was stolen. The bag's disappearance coincided with the release of Lawrence of Arabia, the film which popularised his story and it was thought the theft could have been inspired by the publicity and excitement generated by the film.\n\nIn 2001, the sleeping bag was returned. The Independent reported: \n\n\"The sleeping bag that served as a guest bed to some of the 20th century's most distinguished authors at TE Lawrence's weekend retreat has been returned 36 years after it was stolen. National Trust custodians of Clouds Hill, the author's cottage in Dorset, were amazed when a weather-beaten package from Belgium arrived containing the sleeping bag, along with a sheepish note that read: 'This is yours'. The bag, embroidered with the word 'tuum' ['yours'], was provided for guests at the cottage, while Lawrence slept on the floor in the other sleeping bag, marked 'meum' ['mine']. According to Jeremy Wilson, Lawrence's biographer, tuum's occupants included George Bernard Shaw, E. M. Forster and Robert Graves\"  \n\nAddress\n\n[http://maps.google.com/maps?fq&hl\nen&qClouds+Hill,+Wareham,+Dorset+BH20+7NQ&sll\n50.718988,-2.251682&sspn0.012227,0.043259&ie\nUTF8&z11&ll\n50.735586,-2.251511&spn0.19556,0.692139&om\n1&iwloc=addr Clouds Hill]\nWareham, Dorset BH20 7NQ\nTelephone: 01929 405616\nQuestion:\nWhich 20th century soldier and adventurer lived at Clouds Hill, Dorset?\nAnswer:\nT E Lawrence\nPassage:\nFougasse (bread)\nIn French cuisine, fougasse is a type of bread typically associated with Provence but found (with variations) in other regions. Some versions are sculpted or slashed into a pattern resembling an ear of wheat.\n\nHistory and etymology\n\nIn ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flatbread baked in the ashes of the hearth (focus in Latin).  This became a diverse range of breads that include focaccia in Italian cuisine, hogaza in Spain, fogassa in Catalonia, fug\u00e0ssa in Ligurian, poga\u010da in the Balkans, pog\u00e1csa in Hungary, fougasse in Provence (originally spelled fogatza), fouace or fou\u00e9e in other French regions and on the Channel Islands.  The Provence version is more likely to have additions in the form of olives, cheese, or anchovies, which may be regarded as a primitive form of pizza without the tomato.\n\nThere is also in Portugal the foga\u00e7a, a sweet bread. In Brazil, p\u00e3o sovado is a typical big fougasse, while a recipe, typical of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Esp\u00edrito Santo and surrounding regions, that is halfway between fougasse and bolillo (in these regions known as p\u00e3o franc\u00eas or p\u00e3o-de-sal), somewhat resembling a savory small brioche, is called p\u00e3o su\u00ed\u00e7o. They are perhaps the sweetest of savory artisanal bread recipes commonly made in Brazil.\n\nFougasse was traditionally used to assess the temperature of a wood fired oven. The time it would take to bake gives an idea of the oven temperature and whether the rest of the bread can be loaded.\n\nFougasse is also a type of pastry from Monaco that is topped with almonds and nuts.\n\nUse in dishes\n\nIt is used to make the French version of calzone, which can have cheese and small squarish strips of bacon inside the pocket made by folding over the bread. Other variations include dried fruit, Roquefort and nuts or olives and goat cheese. It is known by extension as a fougasse even though it is more a sandwich than just a type of bread.\nQuestion:\nFougasse, associated with Provence, is what type of food?\nAnswer:\nSomun\nPassage:\nWaterborne diseases\nWaterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. Infection commonly results during bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food, or the consumption of food thus infected. Various forms of waterborne diarrheal disease probably are the most prominent examples, and affect mainly children in developing countries; according to the World Health Organization, such diseases account for an estimated 4.1% of the total DALY global burden of disease, and cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. \n\nOverview\n\nThe term \"waterborne disease\" is reserved largely for infections that predominantly are transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water. Trivially, many infections may be transmitted by microbes or parasites that accidentally, possibly as a result of exceptional circumstances, have entered the water, but the fact that there might be an occasional freak infection need not mean that it is useful to categorise the resulting disease as \"waterborne\". Nor is it common practice to refer to diseases such as malaria as \"waterborne\" just because mosquitoes have aquatic phases in their life cycles, or because treating the water they inhabit happens to be an effective strategy in control of the mosquitoes that are the vectors.\n\nMicroorganisms causing diseases that characteristically are waterborne prominently include protozoa and bacteria, many of which are intestinal parasites, or invade the tissues or circulatory system through walls of the digestive tract. Various other waterborne diseases are caused by viruses. (In spite of philosophical difficulties associated with defining viruses as \"organisms\", it is practical and convenient to regard them as microorganisms in this connection.)\n\nYet other important classes of water-borne diseases are caused by metazoan parasites. Typical examples include certain Nematoda, that is to say \"roundworms\". As an example of water-borne Nematode infections, one important waterborne nematodal disease is Dracunculiasis. It is acquired by swallowing water in which certain copepoda occur that act as vectors for the Nematoda. Anyone swallowing a copepod that happens to be infected with Nematode larvae in the genus Dracunculus, becomes liable to infection. The larvae cause guinea worm disease. \n\nAnother class of waterborne metazoan pathogens are certain members of the Schistosomatidae, a family of blood flukes. They usually infect victims that make skin contact with the water. Blood flukes are pathogens that cause Schistosomiasis of various forms, more or less seriously affecting hundreds of millions of people world-wide. \n\nLong before modern studies had established the germ theory of disease, or any advanced understanding of the nature of water as a vehicle for transmitting disease, traditional beliefs had cautioned against the consumption of water, rather favouring processed beverages such as beer, wine and tea. For example, in the camel caravans that crossed Central Asia along the Silk Road, the explorer Owen Lattimore noted, \"The reason we drank so much tea was because of the bad water. Water alone, unboiled, is never drunk. There is a superstition that it causes blisters on the feet.\" \n\nSocioeconomic impact\n\nWaterborne diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, locally as well as internationally. People who are infected by a waterborne disease are usually confronted with related costs and not seldom with a huge financial burden. This is especially the case in less developed countries. The financial losses are mostly caused by e.g. costs for medical treatment and medication, costs for transport, special food, and by the loss of manpower. Many families must even sell their land to pay for treatment in a proper hospital. On average, a family spends about 10% of the monthly households income per person infected. \n\nInfections by type of pathogen \n\nProtozoan \n\nParasitic \n\nBacterial \n\n*\n\nViral \n\n*\n\nAlgal \n\n*\nQuestion:\nThe devastating water-borne disease Schistosomiasis, or Snail Fever, is more commonly called what?\nAnswer:\nGenital schistosomiasis\nPassage:\nRochebaron\nRochebaron is a soft blue cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk, in the town of Beauzac in the Auvergne region, in the Massif Central, France.\n\nThis cheese is one of several that are made by curdling milk and separating the curds from the whey. Pressed into moulds, Rochebaron is then pierced with wires impregnated with Penicillium glaucum to produce blue veins through the soft whitish body of the cheese.

The         term 'Patron' is used in Christian religions,         including the Roman Catholic religion, to describe         holy and virtuous men and women who are considered         to be a defender of a specific group of people or of         a country. There is a patron for virtually every         cause, country, profession or special interest.         There are two categories of saints: martyrs and         confessors. A martyr is one who is put to death for         his Christian faith or convictions.\n\u00a0\nFast, concise facts and information about Saint Alban\nThe following provides fast and concise facts and information:\nThe patron of Converts and refugees\nMemorial Day / Feast Day: June 22nd\nDate of Death: Saint Alban died in 305\nSt. Alban was born in the Roman town Verulamium (now Saint Albans) in Hertfordshire, England\nCause of Death: Beheaded\nWho or what is Saint Alban the patron saint of?\nSaint Alban is the patron of converts and refugees. St. Alban was the first English martyr. Meanings, definition and origins - a patron is considered to be a defender of a specific group of people or of a nation. There is a patron for virtually every cause, profession or special interest. Prayers are considered more likely to be answered by asking a patron for intercession on their behalf. St. Alban is represented by a sword and a fountain, because, when he reached the summit of the hill where he was to be beheaded, he prayed for water to quench his thirst, and immediately a spring appeared at his feet. His burial-place was afterwards revealed to King Offa, who erected a shrine over his remains at what is now St. Albans, in Hertfordshire.\nWhy is Saint Alban the patron of Converts and refugees?\nWhy is Saint Alban is the patron of Converts and refugees? St Alban was a Roman soldier who was converted to the Christian faith and became the the first English martyr for his convictions.\nDeath of Saint Alban\nThere are two categories of saints: martyrs and confessors. A Christian martyr is regarded as one who is put to death for his Christian faith or convictions. Confessors are people who died natural deaths. Date of Death: Saint Alban died in 305. Cause of Death - he was Beheaded.\u00a0\nHow Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art\nIt is helpful to be able to recognise Saint Alban in paintings, stained glass windows, illuminated manuscripts, architecture and other forms of Christian art. The artistic representations reflect the life or death of saints, or an aspect of life with which the person is most closely associated. Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art with a sword and a fountain.\nFeast Day of Saint Alban\nThe Feast Day of Saint Alban is June 22nd. The origin of Feast Days: most saints have specially designated feast days and are associated with a specific day of the year and these are referred to as the saint's feast day. The feast days first arose from the very early Christian custom of the annual commemoration of martyrs on the dates of their deaths at the same time celebrating their birth into heaven.\n\u00a0\nHistory, Life, Biography, Facts and Information about Saint Alban\nFast, concise facts and information about Saint Alban\nWhat is Saint Alban the patron of?\nDate of Death: 305\nQuestion:\nWho was the first English Christian martyr - his feast day is June 22nd.?\nAnswer:\nAlban, Saint\nPassage:\nWomen's Cricket World Cup\nThe ICC Women's Cricket World Cup is the premier international championship of women's One Day International cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was originally administered by the International Women's Cricket Council until the two associations merged in 2005. The first tournament was held in England in 1973, two years before the first men's tournament.\n\nParticipation in the tournament has varied through the eight competitions: fifteen different teams have played, but only Australia, England and New Zealand have appeared in every tournament. India have appeared in all but two of the competitions. Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Young England have all appeared in just one tournament: in each case, the first competition, in 1973.\n\nThe most recent tournament, the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, was held in India for the third time in February. In the final Australia beat West Indies by 114 runs at the Brabourne Stadium.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst World Cup\n\nWomen's international cricket was first played in 1934, when a party from England toured Australia and New Zealand. The first Test match was played on 28\u201331 December 1934, and was won by England.  The first Test against New Zealand followed early the following year. These three nations remained the only Test playing teams in women's cricket until 1960, when South Africa played a number of matches against England. Limited overs cricket was first played by first-class teams in England in 1962.  Nine years later, the first international one day match was played in men's cricket, when England took on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. \n\nTalks began in 1971 about holding a World Cup for women's cricket, led by Jack Hayward.  South Africa, under pressure from the world for their apartheid laws, were not invited to take part in the competition.  Both of the other two Test playing nations, Australia and New Zealand were invited. Hayward had previously organised tours of the West Indies by England women, and it was from this region that the other two competing nations were drawn; Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago. To make up the numbers, England also fielded a \"Young England\" team, and an \"International XI\" was also included. Five South Africans were invited to play for the International XI as a means of compensation for the team not being invited, but these invitations were later withdrawn.\n\nThe inaugural tournament was held at a variety of venues across England in June and July 1973,  two years before the first men's Cricket World Cup was played.  The competition was played as a round-robin tournament, and the last scheduled match was England against Australia. Australia went into the game leading the table by a solitary point: they had won four matches and had one abandoned. England had also won four matches, but they had lost to New Zealand.  As a result, the match also served as a de facto final for the competition. England won the match, held at Edgbaston, Birmingham by 92 runs to win the tournament. \n\nResults\n\nBy year\n\nBy team\n\n;Legend\n* \u2013 Champions\n* \u2013 Runners-up\n* \u2013 Third place\n* \u2013 Losing semi-finalist (no third-place playoff)\n*QF \u2013 Losing quarter-finalist (no further playoffs)\n*1R \u2013 First round\n*\u00a0\u2014 Hosts\n\nRecords\nQuestion:\nWho won the Women's Cricket World Cup played at Sydney, Australia, in 2009?\nAnswer:\nEnglnad\nPassage:\nMen's Fastest Mile Times (World Records) - About.com Sports\nWorld Records for Men's Fastest Mile Times\nBy Mike Rosenbaum\nUpdated September 23, 2016.\nIt\u2019s never been an Olympic or World Championship event, yet the mile remains the only non-metric race distance in which the IAAF recognizes a world record. Long after the other non-metric distances have vanished from the world record books, those 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards \u2013 or about 1.61 kilometers \u2013 continue to capture the imaginations of runners and fans alike as a premier middle distance event.\nThe first IAAF-recognized world record in the mile was run by John Paul Jones of the U.S. No, the record doesn\u2019t go back to the American Revolution. This John Paul Jones performed his feat on May 31, 1913, in Allston, Mass., where he completed the mile in 4:14.4. France\u2019s Jules Ladoumegue later brought the mark under 4:10, running 4:09.2 on Oct. 4, 1931, in Paris. The mark crept down toward the 4-minute mark throughout the 1940s. In a 3-year period from July 1942 through July 1945 a pair of Swedes, Gunder Hagg, and Arne Andersson, exchanged the record six times.\ncontinue reading below our video\nUnderstanding Baseball\nHagg ended the give-and-take with a time of 4:01.4 on July 17, 1945. His mark stood for almost nine years, during which time the pundits debated on whether a 4-minute mile was humanly possible, as a runner after runner tried and failed to crack a key psychological \u2013 and, as some believed, physical \u2013 barrier.\nThe 4-Minute Mile:\nOn May 6, 1954, great Britain\u2019s Roger Bannister answered the questions by running the first sub-4:00 miles, finishing in 3:59.4 while assisted by a pair of pacemakers. Bannister, then a medical student, developed his own training methods \u2013 featuring relatively short, intense workouts \u2013 that carried him through on a windy day. Bannister ran lap times of 57.5, 60.7, 62.3 and 58.9 seconds. He was timed in 3:43.0 through 1500 meters.\nWhile Bannister is famous for shattering the 4-minute barrier, many forget that he held the title for less than seven weeks before Australia\u2019s John Landy finished in 3:58.0 on June 21, 1954. Bannister retired from racing before the end of the year, to devote himself to medicine, but not before racing against Landy in \u201cThe Mile of the Century\u201d in Vancouver that August. Landy shot in front by the end of the first lap, hoping to wear out the normally fast-finishing Bannister. But Bannister ran his own race, paced himself, then shot into the lead with less than 90 yards remaining to win in 3:58.8 to Landy\u2019s 3:59.6, the first time two runners topped four minutes in the same race.\nIn 1958 Australia\u2019s Herb Elliott ran 3:54.5 to break the record set the previous year by Derek Ibbotson by 2.7 seconds, the biggest drop in the world record time during the IAAF era.\nThe record returned to U.S. soil in 1966 when the precocious Jim Ryun posted a 3:51.3 time, which he lowered to 3:51.1 the following year. Ryun was the first high school runner to break four minutes, with a time of 3:59 in 1964. At age 18 he owned the U.S. mile record of 3:55.3. At 19 he owned the world record. He was the fourth and, as of 2012, the last American to reign as the mile\u2019s world record-holder.\nJohn Walker Cracks 3:50:\nNew Zealand\u2019s John Walker took the record below 3:50 in August 1975 with a time of 3:49.4, fulfilling his promise to the organizers of the meet held in Goteborg, Sweden. Walker convinced meet officials to change the scheduled 1500-meter race to the mile, telling them he\u2019d take a shot at the world record. He was paced through the first half mile, with lap times of 55.8 and 59.3, then sped up on the final two laps, running the third quarter in 57.9 and the fourth in 56.4 seconds. Walker eventually became the first man to run 100 sub-4:00 miles.\nGreat Britain then enjoyed a stretch of 14 years in which three different British runners owned the mark. Just as Hagg and Andersson played give-and-go with the record in the \u201840s, so too did Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett in 1979-81. In a 25-month stretch, beginning in July 1979 when Coe edged Walker\u2019s mark by four-tenths of a second, Coe owned the record three times and Ovett twice. Coe began the British siege in only the third-mile race of his life, in an Oslo meet in which Walker participated. Coe finally prevailed in his duel with Ovett, as Coe\u2019s time of 3:47.33 set in August of 1981 lived for almost four years before Steve Cram lowered it to 3:46.32 in 1985.\nEl Guerrouj Takes Charge:\nOnly one African runner \u2013 Filbert Bayi, who broke Ryun\u2019s record and held the mile mark for just three months \u2013 had owned the mile record before Algeria\u2019s Noureddine Morceli topped Cram\u2019s mark by running 3:44.39 on Sept. 5, 1993. The 1.93-second drop in the record was the largest margin since Ryun set his first record in 1966. Morocco\u2019s Hicham El Guerrouj then lowered the mark to 3:43.13 on July 7, 1999 \u2013 almost identical to Bannister\u2019s 1500-meter time in 1954 \u2013 yet came close to losing the race, held in Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium. Noah Ngeny ran with El Guerrouj all the way and edged Morceli\u2019s record as well, finishing in 3:43.40. With his mark still intact in 2015, El Guerrouj has held the IAAF mile record longer than anyone else, while Ngeny\u2019s time remained No. 2 on the all-time list. As of 2015, El Guerrouj had seven of the top 10 mile times in history; Alan Webb owns the fastest mile of the 21st century by someone other than El Guerrouj, posting a time of 3:46.91 in 2007.\nRead more about:\nQuestion:\nWho was the first man to break three and a half minutes for the 1500 metres\nAnswer:\nStephen Cram\nPassage:\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer ...\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\n* Premier League leads way as soccer clubs splash TV cash\n* Real Madrid and Barcelona defy Spain's economic downturn\n* Clubs seen complying with UEFA rules despite investment\nBy Keith Weir\nLONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European soccer clubs have reinvested cash from television deals to go on a record-breaking summer spending spree led by teams from the English Premier League and Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.\nClubs in the English top flight had spent 630 million pounds ($980.5 million) by the player transfer deadline on Monday night. Teams in the big European leagues must now wait until January before they can hire new players.\nThe spending by English clubs broke the 2008 record of 500 million pounds, according to figures compiled by business services group Deloitte, and underlined the Premier League's status as the world's richest national competition.\n\"As the financial rewards for participation and success in the Premier League increase, so it follows that clubs are investing on the pitch to ensure they continue to benefit from the remarkable Premier League growth story,\" Deloitte's Dan Jones said.\nChampions Manchester United and the other 19 Premier League teams are expected to share revenues of about 1.6 billion pounds this season thanks to enhanced television deals with BSkyB and BT in Britain, and broadcasters around the globe that began last month.\nIt was not all one-way traffic as the Premier League lost one of its biggest names when Real Madrid bought Welshman Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur for a world record 100 million euros ($132 million).\nNot to be outdone, Real's perennial rivals Barcelona spent $75 million to buy Brazil forward Neymar from Brazilian top division club Santos.\nPLAYING FAIR?\nSpending such sums might appear to defy logic given Spain's economic problems but Real and Barcelona enjoy the luxury of doing their own TV deals rather than pooling revenues as happens in England and other major leagues.\nThat has made the two clubs the world's richest in terms of revenues and allowed them to remain buyers when many of their Spanish rivals are forced to sell their best players.\nReal and Barcelona have TV deals with Spanish production and distribution company Mediapro. They both also have lucrative new main sponsorship deals this season - Barcelona with Qatar Airways and Real with the Emirates airline names on their kit.\nOverall spending levels may also raise eyebrows when loss-making clubs are supposed to be complying with new Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA, European soccer's governing body, to put soccer on a more stable footing.\n\"A lot of English clubs have gone on a spending spree but they haven't breached the Financial Fair Play rules as they are only spending what they have earned,\" said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports business at England's Coventry University.\nClubs also have the advantage of spreading the cost of a player's transfer over the duration of his contract in their accounts, lessening the impact on the bottom line.\nMany clubs also offload players to help fund spending.\nReal Madrid are a case in point - recouping half of what they paid for Bale by selling German international Mesut Ozil to Premier League Arsenal.\nIndeed, the total invested by Premier League clubs comes down to 400 million pounds when proceeds from sales such as that of Bale are factored in.\nSpanish clubs actually generated a surplus of 95 million pounds from player trading this summer, according to Deloitte, while clubs from Italy's cash-strapped Serie A also posted a small profit.\nReblog\nQuestion:\nAccording to a survey carried out by Deloittes early in 2009, which was the world's richest soccer club at that time?\nAnswer:\nReal madrid cf\nPassage:\nRoyal Parks of London\nThe Royal Parks of London are lands originally owned by the monarchy of the United Kingdom for the recreation (mostly hunting) of the royal family. They are part of the hereditary possessions of The Crown.\n\nParks\n\nWith increasing urbanisation of London, some of these were preserved as freely accessible open space and became public parks with the introduction of the Crown Lands Act 1851. There are today eight parks formally described by this name and they cover almost  2000 ha of land in Greater London.\n\n* Bushy Park, 445 ha  \n* Green Park, 19 ha  \n* Greenwich Park, 74 ha  \n* Hyde Park, 142 ha  \n* Kensington Gardens, 111 ha  \n* Regent's Park, 166 ha  \n* Richmond Park, 955 hectares   (2360 acre)\n* St. James's Park, 23 ha  \n\nHyde Park and Kensington Gardens (which are adjacent), Green Park, Regent's Park and St James's Park are the largest green spaces in central London. Bushy Park, Greenwich Park and Richmond Park are in the suburbs. The Royal Parks agency also manages Brompton Cemetery, Grosvenor Square Gardens, Victoria Tower Gardens and the gardens of 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street. \n\nHampton Court Park is also a royal park within Greater London, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks. \n\nLegal position\n\nThe public does not have any legal right to use the Parks, as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, although there are public rights of way across the land. The Royal Parks Agency manages the Royal Parks under powers derived from section 22 of the Crown Lands Act 1851. As part of its statutory management function the Agency permits the public to use the Parks for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under the Parks Regulation Acts 1872\u20131926 which are considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within the Parks. The current regulations are the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.\n\nManagement\n\nThey are managed by The Royal Parks (an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and are policed by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing the parks, the Royal Parks Constabulary, has been abolished). The main form of funding for the Royal Parks is a central government grant. This contrasts with most of London's other parks, which are funded by local borough councils. The Royal Parks generate additional income from commercial activities such as catering and staging public events such as concerts.\n\nThe Royal Parks Foundation is a registered charity which raises funds to protect, support and create new opportunities within the Parks. They have a number of membership schemes such as adoption and champion programmes.\n\nMayoral control\n\nIn 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that control over the Royal Parks should be devolved to the Greater London Authority  and the government put forward proposals for that to happen later on that year.  The plan was welcomed by Royal Parks but it is yet to be implemented following the 2012 London Olympic games.\nQuestion:\nIf the eight Royal Parks in London are arranged alphabetically which comes last?\nAnswer:\nSt. James's\nPassage:\nDrawing pin\nA thumb tack (North American English) or push pin is a short nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and intended to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are used to refer to different designs intended for various purpose. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively.  These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation.  Drawing pin or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on drawing boards. Map pin or map tack refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations on a map and to hold the map in place.\n\nHistory\n\nEdwin Moore invented the \"push-pin\" in 1900 and founded the Moore Push-Pin Company. Moore described the push-pin as a pin with a handle.  Later, in 1904, in Lychen, German clockmaker Johann Kirsten invented flat-headed thumb tacks for use with drawings. \n\nDesign\n\nA thumb tack has two basic components: the head, often made of plastic, metal or  wood, and the body, usually made of steel or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the tack in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as hearts or stars. Thumb tack heads also come in a variety of colors. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some thumb tack designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a tack.\n\nDomed or gripped heads are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed tacks will point upward, posing a hazard.  Thumb tacks also pose a hazard of ingestion and choking, where they may do serious harm.\nQuestion:\nWhat do we call what the Americans call a thumb tack?\nAnswer:\nMap pin\n", "answers": ["55", "fifty-five"], "pred": "# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #", "length": 9233, "dataset": "triviaqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1f4fecc3601c6f6fd6eb04d9996d67dc8c27b9eb4442fecb"}
{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nVictory in Europe Day\nVictory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces.  It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspr\u00e4sident Karl D\u00f6nitz. The administration headed by D\u00f6nitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. \n\nCelebrations \n\nUpon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.\nIn the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. \n\nIn the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was \"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\" Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. \n\nMassive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square. \n\nSoviet Victory Day \n\nAs the Soviet representative in Reims had no authority to sign the German instrument of surrender, the Soviet leadership proposed to consider Reims surrender as a \"preliminary\" act. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.\n\nCommemorative public holidays \n\n(May 8 unless otherwise stated)\n* Italy (25 April) \"Festa della Liberazione\" (Liberation Holiday).\n* Denmark (5 May) as \"Befrielsen\" (The Liberation)\n* Netherlands (5 May) as \"Bevrijdingsdag\" (Liberation Day)\n* United Kingdom: In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War.\n*East Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation), a public holiday from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985.

It reached a peak of No. 29 in the UK Albums Chart.  In the United States, it was released by United Artists Records as Wizzard's Brew (with a different cover photo) but failed to chart there.\n\nIn 2003, Mojo magazine ranked it number 18 on its list of the \"Top 50 Eccentric Albums\". \n\nHistory\n\nIn approach, the album was much more experimental than the group's hit singles, with elements of hard rock (an approach Wood's previous band The Move had explored on their 1970 album Looking On), and improvisation, especially on the lengthy \"Meet Me At The Jailhouse\".  Wood frequently used ring modulation to give the instruments a harsh, distorted sound, and the album may represent an early foray into recording technique that would eventually be called lo-fi.  Critical and popular reaction was mixed.\n\nThe original release included a lyric and photo sheet. It was reissued on CD in 1999 but soon deleted.

Birth stones are and can be worn as jewellery and pendants.\n\nHistory of birthstones\n\nWestern custom\n\nThe first century Jewish historian Josephus believed there was a connection between the twelve stones in Aaron's breastplate, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve signs of the zodiac.  Translations and interpretations of the passage in Exodus regarding the breastplate have varied widely, however, with Josephus himself giving two different lists for the twelve stones  (Kunz argues that Josephus saw the breastplate of the Second Temple, not the one described in Exodus).  St. Jerome, referencing Josephus, said the Foundation Stones of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:19\u201320) would be appropriate for Christians to use.  In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written because the book of Revelation stated \"their name would be inscribed on the Foundation Stones, and his virtue\".  Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month.  Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates Kunz places the custom in eighteenth century Poland, while the Gemological Institute of America starts it in Germany in the 1560s. \n\nModern lists of birthstones have little to do with either the breastplate or the Foundation Stones of Christianity. Tastes, customs and confusing translations have distanced them from their historical origins,  with one author calling the 1912 Kansas list \"nothing but a piece of unfounded salesmanship.\" \n\nTraditional birthstones\n\nAncient traditional birthstones are society-based birthstones. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. \n\nThe Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. These are traditional stones of English-speaking societies. Tiffany & Co. published these poems \"of unknown author\" for the first time in a pamphlet in 1870. \n\nModern birthstones\n\nIn 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the (American) National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list.  The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952  by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002.  In 2016, the American Gem Trade Association and Jewelers of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August.   Britain's National Association of Goldsmiths created their own standardized list of birthstones in 1937. \n\nEastern custom\n\nA Hindu text from 1879, Mani Mala, lists gems for each month. \n\nBirthstones by cultures\n\nZodiacal\n\nTropical zodiac\n\nBirthday (day of the week) stones\n\nWhile this word has also been used as synonym of Birth stone (see above), there is a separate list of assignment according to the day of the week of the recipient's birth: \n* Sunday: topaz, diamond\n* Monday: pearl, crystal\n* Tuesday: ruby, emerald\n* Wednesday: amethyst, lodestone\n* Thursday: sapphire, carnelian\n* Friday: emerald, cat's eye\n* Saturday: turquoise, diamond\nQuestion:\nWhat is the birthstone for February?\nAnswer:\nAmythist\nPassage:\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD ...\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD) YouTube Video - YouTube\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD) YouTube Video\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

The entire structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).\nIt is the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually. When erected in 1999 it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 m (520 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006 and then the 165 m (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008. It is still described by its operators as \"the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel\" (as the wheel is supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the Nanchang and Singapore wheels). It is the 20th tallest structure in London.\nThe London Eye, or Millennium Wheel, was officially called the British Airways London Eye and then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye. Since 20 January 2011, its official name is the EDF Energy London Eye following a three-year sponsorship deal.\nThe London Eye is located in the London Borough of Lambeth at the western end of Jubilee Gardens, on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge.\nSource:\nQuestion:\nHow high, in metres, is the London Eye?\nAnswer:\n135 distance\nPassage:\nAbel Janszoon Tasman - Australian Dictionary of Biography\nBiography - Abel Janszoon Tasman - Australian Dictionary of Biography\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography\nTip: searches only the name field\nTip: Use double quotes to search for a phrase\nThis article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography , Volume 2, (MUP), 1967\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (1603-1659), by Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp\nNational Library of Australia, nla.pic-an2282370\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (1603?-1659), mariner, was born at Lutjegast, near Groningen, in the Netherlands. He received a sufficient education to enable him to express his ideas clearly in writing and to become a skilled navigator. He married Claesgie Meyndrix, by whom he had a daughter. After his wife died, he married Joanna Tiercx in January 1632. Soon afterwards, as a sailor before the mast, he sailed for the East Indies, where he was a first mate in February and a skipper in May 1634. In that year in a minor exploration he had a narrow escape from death, when in an incautious landing several of his companions were massacred by people of Ceram. After spending some time in warlike and anti-smuggling operations he returned to Holland in 1637.\nHe sailed for the Indies again in 1638 as skipper of a flute, taking his wife with him. From the outset he was treated as one of the most reliable skippers there. He was at first employed in military and trading voyages, but in 1639 was appointed second-in-command, under Quast, of two ships which set out in June to find islands believed to lie east of Japan. He returned in November from this search. Despite a disastrous death-toll on it, he offered to repeat the search, but was sent instead on trading voyages to Japan and Cambodia.\nIn 1642 he was appointed to command two ships to explore southern and eastern waters. Sailing in August he discovered Van Diemen's Land, New Zealand, the Tonga Islands and some of the Fiji group, and re-explored part of the north coast of New Guinea. On his return to Batavia in June 1643 he was chosen to take part in an expedition to form a settlement in the Tonga Islands from which the Chilean coast was to be raided; while this expedition was preparing, he was ordered to find whether there was a passage into the South Sea between Carpentaria and De Witt's Land. For this purpose he set out with three vessels at the end of January 1644 and, following the coasts from Cape Valsche round to Cape Cloates, satisfied himself that, except perhaps at Endeavour Strait, there was no passage. He was rewarded after his return in August 1644 by confirmation in the grade of commandeur, with a substantial increase in pay dated back to the beginning of his voyage in 1642.\nThe plan to raid Chile was abandoned, and Tasman was appointed to the Council of Justice at Batavia. In mid-1647 he was sent on a mission to the King of Siam and was granted precedence over all Dutchmen in the kingdom. After that mission, he was given command of a fleet of eight vessels which sailed in May 1648 against the Spaniards. His conduct in this operation was unsatisfactory and, after his return in January 1649, proceedings were taken against him for having, when inflamed by liquor, treated one of his sailors in a barbarous way; as a result he was removed from office during the governor-general's pleasure. He was formally reinstated in January 1651, but not long afterwards retired from the service and became a merchant in Batavia. He died there in affluent circumstances in 1659. His daughter by his first marriage had married first Philip Heylman, and later Jacob Bremer. In 1661 permission was given for his widow to marry Jan Meyndert Springer.\nTasman was a member of the Reformed Church. He was a brave and energetic mariner, a humane and properly cautious explorer, and a conspicuously able commander, though over-hasty on one occasion at least. Reflections which have been cast upon his courage are the fruit of ignorance. There are two supposed portraits of him: one owned by the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, the other in the National Library in Canberra.\nSelect Bibliography\nJ. E.

Scheduled flights were initially offered over a New York - Brussels - Tel Aviv route in addition to charter flights to Athens, Frankfurt, Rome, and Zurich.  Short-lived New York - Los Angeles flights were introduced with the addition of an ex-Avianca Boeing 747-100 in 1984. The airline was headquartered in Building 178 and later in Hangar 17 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City.  \n\nHistory \n\nTower Air was co-founded, majority owned, and managed by Morris K. Nachtomi, an Israeli citizen who had emigrated to the United States. After a 30-year career with El Al, Nachtomi joined a wholesaler and tour package operator Tower Travel Corporation in 1981. Tower Travel Corporation was founded by Zev Melamid and his wife Estelle in the 1970s to promote discount travel to Israel. Tower Travel Corporation is credited with developing the wholesale charter market between New York and Tel Aviv.\n\nTower Air was formed on August 13, 1982 by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi, and Sam Fondlier as equal shareholders.  The airline was formed to replace the lift Tower Travel Corporation lost when Flying Tiger Line via a subsidiary, Metro International Airlines, decided to end scheduled and charter commercial passenger service (although military airlift cargo flights operated by Flying Tiger continued) and the three Boeing 747s configured for passenger flights were traded to Pan Am in exchange for all-cargo 747 freighter aircraft.\n\nArthur Fondlier, son of Sam Fondlier and the former Chief Financial Officer of Tower Air, was a passenger in first class section of Pan Am flight 103. His untimely death gave Morris Nachtomi much more freedom in management and cost-cutting.\n\nThe company won many contracts from the United States Department of Defense to transport armed forces personnel to overseas locations, and from the United Nations to transport troops to their peacekeeping missions all over the world. Tower often flew charters for groups of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca.\n\nTower Air's main base of scheduled operations was John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, New York and during their peak they had their own terminal (a former Pan Am Admin facility). There was a large focus on flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, becoming a major competitor to El Al and British Airways in the US-Israel market. The airline also had several flights to France, Greece and Brazil, as well as high density domestic destinations in the New York market, including San Juan, Miami, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Tower Air also sometimes provided substitute aircraft for other carriers, for example on the JFK to LHR route when weather delayed an inbound Virgin Atlantic Airways flight in December 1994.\n\nThe 1997 Zagat Survey ranked Tower Air 59th out of 61 ranked carriers in terms of maintenance, ahead of only Valujet and Aeroflot.  In February 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed two civil penalties totaling $276,000 for continuing to fly aircraft that required maintenance.  In January, 1998 the FAA successfully sought to have the airline remove Guy Nachtomi, son of the Chairman and CEO, 24 years old at that time, from the position of Vice President-Operations. This was done in part because of the airline's maintenance problems, as well as his lack of airline experience (he worked at Twentieth Century Fox until 1994).[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1998/05/01/14/0000940180-98-000483/Section9.asp TOWER AIR INC - TOWRQ Proxy Statement (definitive) (DEF 14A) COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS] The junior Mr. Nachtomi continued service with the company in a capacity unrelated to maintenance as Vice President-Office of the Chairman. The Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Review Board suspended Tower Air military charters from January 27 to February 12, 1999, pending an on-site review of its operations. At the same time the airline lost an arbitration brought by the Association of Flight Attendants, claiming that Tower Air was lodging their flight attendants in dirty Tel Aviv hotels with poor security and bed bugs.\n\nTower Air filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 29, 2000, ceased all scheduled service on May 1, 2000  and surrendered their FAA  air operator's certificate on November 28, 2000. \n\nDestinations\n\nDestinations at time of closure\n\n*Israel\n**Tel Aviv  \n*United States\n**Miami, Florida\n**New York City, New York (JFK \u2013 Airline Hub)\n**San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nDestinations before closure\n\n*Belgium\n**Brussels\n*Denmark \n**Copenhagen (via Cologne)\n*Santo Domingo\n*France\n**Paris  \n*Finland\n**Helsinki\n*Germany\n**Berlin \n**Cologne\n*Greece\n**Athens\n*India\n**Delhi\n**Mumbai\n*Israel\n**Tel Aviv (via brussels)\n*Netherlands\n**Amsterdam Schiphol\n*Norway\n**Oslo Airport Fornebu to New York JFK\n*Sweden\n**Stockholm Arlanda Airport to New York JFK\n*United States\n**Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n**Las Vegas, Nevada\n**Los Angeles, California\n**Oakland, California\n**San Francisco, California\n\nAircraft\n\nTower Air's fleet consisted of Boeing 747s in both the -100 and -200 series, including both passenger and cargo aircraft.\n\nIncidents and accidents\n\nOn December 20, 1995, Tower Air flight 41 from New York Kennedy to Miami veered off the runway during takeoff in a snowstorm resulting in one flight attendant receiving serious injuries and 24 passengers receiving minor injuries. The aircraft sustained heavy damage and had to be written off. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of this accident was the captain's failure to reject the takeoff in a timely manner when excessive nosewheel steering tiller inputs resulted in a loss of directional control on a slippery runway.[http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/1996/AAR9604.pdf Runway Departure During Attempted Takeoff, Tower Air Flight 41, Boeing 747-136, N605FF, JFK International Airport, New York, December 20, 1995][http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetGOJG/201295xx.htm NTSB Press Release - 10/29/96]\nQuestion:\nWhich country does the airline Tower Air come from?\nAnswer:\nThe United States of America\nPassage:\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his ...\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm (From HeraldScotland)\nJobs Business Directory Local Info Dating Buy Sell Book an Ad\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm\nMUFFIN The Mule, the vintage TV puppet, is to make a comeback for his 60th birthday and trot into the twenty-first century.\nBBC chiefs have bought a new series based on the character, which is expected to be shown in the next three years.

Muffin, it will be recalled, used his head a great deal in ''conversations'' with Ms Mills.\nMuffin went from strength to strength, clumping around on the piano top with Ms Mills playing the music and Ann Hogarth standing on the piano to operate him from behind a partition. Further sidekicks emerged as the shows went on, including a bossy penguin called Mr Peregrine Esquire, a rather shy Louise the Lamb, Oswald the Ostrich, Willie the Worm, and a genial minstrel puppet called Wally the Gog.\nMuffin was the first star, in Britain at least, entirely created by television.\nBy 1950, there were many merchandise spin-offs from the character, including records, song and story books and comic strips, while Muffin crossed the Atlantic in films made for American television. Some children even got Muffin bedroom slippers. TV Comic featured Muffin on its front cover for its first issue in November 1951.\nA BBC spokeswoman said: ''Muffin will be something of a problem-solver - he helps out all the other animals.

Founded in 1983, it is the largest international comedy festival in the world. \n\nHistory\n\nJust for Laughs was founded in 1983 by Gilbert Rozon as a two-day French language event. In 1985, Andy Nulman joined the festival's staff and introduced English language events as well; under Nulman's stewardship, the festival increased to a full month, with French-speaking performers during the first half, and English speakers in the second half. International and non-verbal acts (acrobats, pantomimes, etc.) are scattered throughout the program. \n\nIn 1999, Nulman left the festival's full-time employ; however, he directed its major Gala Shows at the Saint-Denis Theatre every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival's parent company. After an 11-year absence, Nulman returned to Just for Laughs in July 2010 as president of Festivals and Television. \n\nEach day, performers, \"New Vaudevillians\" and other acts both vocal and visual perform throughout the city, particularly in the \"Latin Quarter\"\u2014an area known for its theatres, caf\u00e9s and boutique shopping. In the evenings, the nightclubs and live venue theatres offer special programs supporting the performers. \n\nAlthough Just for Laughs attracts spectators from around the world, many of those in the audience are talent scouts, booking agents, producers and managers from the entertainment industry. Performing at the festival is one of the biggest opportunities for undiscovered talent to showcase their act in front of industry professionals.\n\nThe Just for Laughs festival also has the Comedia comedy film festival component, which started in 1996. It gives awards for feature and short films. 2005, Comedia screened 125 short films from around the world as well as several feature-length films.\n\nIn February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in Hollywood, Florida. That coastal area is a favourite winter destination for Quebecers who head south to vacation in the warmer weather. The event, Juste Pour Rire\u2014En Vacances (Just For Laughs\u2014On Vacation), was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting.\n\nIn July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in Toronto, Ontario. In 2009, the Chicago festival was launched and aired on TBS.\n\nTV shows\n\nJust for Laughs has also been a launchpad for many US network television and sitcom careers, and is frequently featured as a foreign on-location highlight of late-night US network talk shows.\n\nJust For Laughs films many performances at the annual festival in Montreal and the TV productions from these tapings air regularly on CBC Television, The Comedy Network, TVA and YTV. The shows feature stand-up performances from the festival and sometimes include \"canned bits\" shot on location around Montreal, Canada.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, ABC aired episodes of Just for Laughs: Gags.  It consisted of two half-hour episodes, and aired mostly on Tuesdays from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm ET. \n\nThe content and format was exactly the same as the Canadian counterpart, but was hosted by Rick Miller, who introduced each segment with a quirky pun. The show returned to the ABC lineup as a mid-season replacement on January 1, 2008.  The series was initially not renewed after the half-season, but ABC reversed their decision. \n\nThe third season of the show, titled simply Just for Laughs, began airing on June 21, 2009 at 7:00 pm ET.   The program returned in the 2014-15 season under the Just for Laughs: Gags title as a syndicated offering to the United States through PPI Releasing, which mainly specializes in syndicating Canadian programming to American stations.\n\nJust for Laughs: All Access, which airs on The Comedy Network, airs recordings of live stand-up comedy performances from the festival.\nQuestion:\n'Just For Laughs' is afamous televised comedy festival held annually in which Canadian city?\nAnswer:\nMotnreal\nPassage:\nPointillism\nPointillism is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image. Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism.  The term \"Pointillism\" was first coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-Impressionism. The Divisionists, too, used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes. \n\nTechnique\n\nThe technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to Divisionism, a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint.\"Pointillism.\"  Artcyclopedia. Artists by Movement. John Malyon/Artcyclopedia, 2007. Web. http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/pointillism.html It is a technique with few serious practitioners today,  and is notably seen in the works of Seurat, Signac and Cross. However, see also Andy Warhol's early works, and Pop Art.\n\nPractice\n\nThe practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.\n\nIf red, blue, and green light (the additive primaries) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and partly because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.\n\nThe painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture.\n\nThe majority of Pointillism is done in oil paints. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed. \n\nMusic\n\nPointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism.  This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie.\n\nNotable artists\n\n*Charles Angrand\n*Chuck Close\n*Henri-Edmond Cross\n*Henri Delavall\u00e9e\n*Albert Dubois-Pillet\n*Louis Fabien (pseudonym)\n*Georges Lemmen\n*Maximilien Luce\n*Camille Pissarro\n*John Roy\n*Georges Seurat\n*Paul Signac\n*Vincent van Gogh\n*Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n*Hippolyte Petitjean\n*Jan Toorop\n\nNotable paintings\n\n* A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat\n* Bathing at Asnieres by Georges Seurat\n* The Windmills at Overschie by Paul Signac\n* Banks of Seine by Georges Seurat\n* A Coastal Scene by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Family in the Orchard by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Countryside at Noon by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Afternoon at Pardigon by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* Rio San Trovaso, Venice by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* The Seine in front of the Trocadero by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* The Pine Tree at St. Tropez by Paul Signac\n* Against the Enamel of Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angels by Paul Signac\n* The Yellow Sail, Venice by Paul Signac\n* Notre Dame Cathedral by Maximilien Luce\n* Le Pont De Pierre, Rouen by Charles Angrand\n* The Beach at Heist by Georges Lemmen\n* Aline Marechal by Georges Lemmen\n* Vase of Flowers by Georges Lemmen\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Lemmen2.jpg|Georges Lemmen, c.1891-92, The Beach at Heist, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay Paris\nFile:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|Camille Pissarro, 1888, La R\u00e9colte des pommes, oil on canvas,  61 x 74 cm, Dallas Museum of Art\nFile:Paul Signac - L'Hirondelle Steamer on the Seine.JPG|Paul Signac, 1901, L'Hirondelle Steamer on the Seine, oil on canvas, National Gallery in Prague\nFile:Henri Edmond Cross - Regatta in Venice - Google Art Project.jpg|Henri Edmond Cross, 1903-04, Regatta in Venice, oil on canvas, 73.7 x 92.7 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston\nFile:Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation..jpg|Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation\nFile:Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm, DSC08255.jpg|Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm\nFile:Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fctzenberger - Nu \u00e0 sa coiffure.jpg|Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fctzenberger, 1911, La Coiffure, oil on canvas, 121 \u00d7 91 cm\nFile:Hippolyte Petitjean - Femmes au bain.jpg|Hippolyte Petitjean, 1919, Femmes au bain, oil on canvas, 61.1 \u00d7 46 cm, private collection\nQuestion:\nPointillism is found in what field?\nAnswer:\nPaintism\nPassage:\nBillboard Music Award\nThe Billboard Music Award is an honor given by Billboard, a publication and music popularity chart covering the music business. The Billboard Music Awards show had been held annually since 1989 in December until it went dormant in 2006. The awards returned in 2011 and is held annually in May. The 2016 Billboard Music Awards aired live on May 22 at 8/7c on ABC. \n\nCeremonies \n\nAward process\n\nUnlike other awards, such as the Grammy Award, which determine nominations as a result of the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are based on United States year-end chart performance according to Nielsen data for sales, number of downloads and total airplay. Awards were given for the top album/artist/single in different genres.\n\nCategories\n\nFrom 1989 to 2006, the show had the same categories and category names every year. In 2011, for the first time, all of the awards were renamed to \"Top [award title]\". The \"of the year\" portion of each category title no longer exists, and many of the awards have been further renamed. Other awards, including both \"crossover\" awards (No. 1 Classical Crossover Artist and No. 1 Classical Crossover Album) were discontinued.\n\nCurrent categories\n\nThe most important categories are Top Artist, Top Billboard 200 Album, Top Hot 100 Song and Top New Artist.

Plans for a new version of the awards in 2008 (in association with AEG Live) fell through, and the BMAs were not held until 2011.\n\nOn February 17, 2011, Billboard announced that it would bring the BMAs back to television, moving from its original home on Fox to its new network, ABC, on May 22, 2011.  A new award statuette was created by New York firm Society Awards. Dick Clark Productions produces the ceremony, giving it control of both of ABC's non-country music awards specials, including the November American Music Awards.\nQuestion:\nWho is unique in being named Billboard's \u2018Woman of the Year\u2019 twice, in 2011 & 2014?\nAnswer:\nT-Swizzle\nPassage:\nAquatint\nAquatint is an intaglio printmaking technique, a variant of etching. \n\nIn intaglio printmaking, the artist makes marks on the plate (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) that are capable of holding ink.  The inked plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, resulting in a transfer of the ink to the paper.  This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.\n\nLike etching, aquatint uses the application of a mordant to etch into the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect.  The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating.  The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.\n\nAnother tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented so that it will carry a fairly dark tone of ink.  The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade.  Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker.  Occasionally these two techniques are combined.\n\nHistory \n\nThe painter and printmaker Jan van de Velde IV invented the aquatint technique in Amsterdam, around 1650.  The cartographer Peter Perez Burdett later introduced his 'secret' aquatint technique to England in the 1770s.   In the United States the printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos popularized aquatints in art schools with his publications (1919\u201340), which simplified the cumbersome techniques, and with traveling exhibitions of his award-winning prints. \n\nTechnique \n\nAn aquatint requires a metal plate, an acid, and something to resist the acid.  Traditionally copper or zinc plates were used. The artist applies a ground that will resist acid.  Ground is applied by either dissolving powdered resin in spirits, applying the powder directly to the surface of the plate, or by using a liquid acrylic resist.  In all forms of etching the acid resist is commonly referred to as \"the ground.\"\n\nAn aquatint box is used to apply resin powder. The powder is at the bottom of the box, a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box. A window allows the engraver to see the density of flowing powder and to place his plate in the box using a drawer. When the powder covers the plate, it can be extracted from the box for the next operations.\n\nThe plate is then heated; if the plate is covered with powder, the resin melts forming a fine and even coat; if it is in spirits, the spirits evaporate and the result is essentially the same. Now the plate is dipped in acid, producing an even and fine level of corrosion (the \"bite\") sufficient to hold ink. At this point, the plate is said to carry about a 50% halftone. This means that, were the plate printed with no further biting, the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white (no ink) and black (full ink).\n\nAt some point the artist will then etch an outline of any aspects of the drawing s/he wishes to establish with line; this provides the basis and guide for the later tone work. S/he may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant \"stop out\" (also called an asphaltum or hard ground) if s/he intends to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights.\n\nThe artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath, progressively stopping out (protecting from acid) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality. These tones, combined with the limited line elements, give aquatints a distinctive, watery look. Also, aquatints, like mezzotints, provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching; but aquatint plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates.\n\nThe first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be).  A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary.  More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area.  Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper.\n\nContemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder, particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift. To produce a printing surface using sugar-lift, the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image \"lifts off\" the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from.\n\nFamous examples \n\n* Francisco Goya famously took great advantage of aquatint printmaking, in his Los Caprichos series (1799); Los Desastres de la Guerra (1810\u201319); La Tauromaquia (1816); and Los disparates (ca. 1816\u201323).\n* Master engraver Robert Havell used aquatint for John James Audubon's Birds of America (1826\u201338).\n* David Hockney, known for his many paintings of the Los Angeles lifestyle in the 60's, has created a number of aquatints and etchings used with color in his \"The Blue Guitar\"  series of prints.\n* La Belle Assembl\u00e9e, a British women's magazine published from 1806 to 1837 had many aquatint colored plates.\nQuestion:\n'Aquatint' is a process of etching which alloying metal with acid?\nAnswer:\nCopper\nPassage:\nLepidopterist\nA lepidopterist or aurelian is a person who specialises in the study of Lepidoptera,  members of an order encompassing moths and the three superfamilies of butterflies, skipper butterflies, and moth-butterflies.

The canvases were produced in 1732\u201333, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. \n\nPaintings\n\nAdaptations\n\nGavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled \"The Rake's Progress\" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.\nQuestion:\nWhich British artist painted the series 'A Rake's Progress' in 1735?\nAnswer:\nHogarthean\nPassage:\nDon't Go Breaking My Heart\n\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" is a duet by Elton John and Kiki Dee. It was written by Elton John with Bernie Taupin under the pseudonyms \"Ann Orson\" and \"Carte Blanche\" (a pun on the expression \"an horse and cart, blanche\"), respectively, and intended as an affectionate pastiche of the Motown style, notably the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye and singers such as Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. It is not to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same title recorded in 1965 by Dionne Warwick for the album Here I Am.\n\nJohn and Taupin originally intended to record the song with Dusty Springfield, but ultimately withdrew the offer; Dusty's partner Sue Cameron later said this was because she was too ill at the time.  \n\nChart performance\n\nWriters John and Taupin received the 1981 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. \n\nUnlike many of John's singles from the 1970s, it was never included on an original album (although it was recorded during the Blue Moves sessions), but was subsequently in released as the third single on the album Duets, in early 1994. This version of the song was recorded with RuPaul, and the album included another duet with Kiki Dee, Cole Porter's \"True Love.\"\n\n\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" was the first No. 1 single in the UK for both John and Kiki Dee, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. John would not enjoy a solo British chart-topper until \"Sacrifice\" in 1990. It also became his sixth No. 1 single in the US, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks and spent one week on the Easy Listening chart.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1976.  In the U.S. it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.   After this duet with Dee, John failed to have another #1 single, without sharing the top song with other credited artists, until his 1997 smash Candle In The Wind 1997.  This 21-year \"Kiki jinx\" included two intervening #1 hits in America for John: \"That's What Friends Are For\" by Dionne & Friends in 1986; and, a 1992 re-make of John's \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" with George Michael credited as a duet.\n\nThe B-side, \"Snow Queen\", was supposedly inspired by Cher, with John's improvising of past Sonny & Cher hits \"I Got You Babe\" and \"The Beat Goes On\", as well as the solo Cher song \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\" during the fadeout of the song.\n\nIn 1977, John guest starred on The Muppet Show and performed the track with Miss Piggy. In 1985, John and Dee performed the track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1987, John appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie miming to the track. He performed the track with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) at the 2001 British Comedy awards. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience with... Elton John.\n\nIn June 2013, 37 years after its original release, the single reached one million sales in the UK.  \n\nAvailability\n\nThe song can be found on Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II (1977)  and Greatest Hits 1976\u20131986; the 1995 UK CD of Rock of the Westies includes it as a bonus track (the US edition did not, however). In 2002, it also appeared on John's 2-disc greatest hits album, Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist.

It was written by John Sullivan, based upon the character of Wilkins Micawber from Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield, although the storylines were original. Sullivan had originally written an adaptation of Dickens' novel which was rejected by the BBC in favour of the 1999 Adrian Hodges adaptation. \n\nIt was broadcast in four parts, the first part on Boxing Day 2001 and starred a number of well-known British actors and actresses.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the first name of the Dickens character Micawber?\nAnswer:\nWilkin\nPassage:\nLes Casquets\nLes Casquets or (The) Casquets ( ); is a group of rocks 13\u00a0km northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little vegetation grows on them.\n\nOrigin of name\n\nTheories as to the origin of the name include: \n*derivation from the French 'cascade', which alludes to the tidal surges which flow around them;\n*derivation from 'casque', referring to the helmet-like shape of the rocks;\n*derivation from 'cas' (broken) and 'quet' (rock).\n\nA map (Leyland map) dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name Casus Rupes (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above,  but which may be a folk etymology.\n\nHistory\n\nWrecks \n\nThere have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6\u20137 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS Stella, wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker Constantia S lost in 1967. \n\nIt was believed for centuries that the loss of HMS Victory in 1744 was attributable to wrecking on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss.  However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nmi from the Casquets. \n\nWorld War II\n\nThe island was the location of a daring raid by the forerunner of the British SAS, the SSRF on 2 September 1942; the raid was led by Major Gus March-Phillipps DSO, OBE and was one of the first raids by Anders Lassen VC MC. In the raid the entire garrison of seven was captured and returned to England as prisoners and the radio and lighthouse wrecked.  \n\nThe Casquets in literature\n\nSwinburne's Les Casquets\n\nA. C. Swinburne's poem  Les Casquets is based on the Houguez family who actually lived on the island for 18 years. The Houguez were originally from Alderney, and the poem describes their life on Les Casquets. The daughter falls in love with a carpenter from Alderney, but moving to his island, finds life there too busy. She finds the \"small bright streets of serene St Anne\" and \"the sight of the works of men\" too much, and returns to Les Casquets.\n\nVictor Hugo's L'Homme qui Rit\n\nVictor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands, says in his novel The Laughing Man (L'Homme qui Rit):\n\n\"To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost...\"\n\nGallery \n\nFile:The Casquets Lighthouses off Alderney 1868.jpg|Les Casquets with lighthouses in 1868\nFile:The Race of Alderney, from the Caskets (about 1868).jpg|Les Casquets looking east (towards Alderney)\nQuestion:\nOff which island is there a group of rocks with a lighthouse called the Casquets?\nAnswer:\nCoat of arms of Alderney\nPassage:\nEncephalitis\nEncephalitis (from Ancient Greek \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, enk\u00e9phalos \"brain\",  composed of \u1f10\u03bd, en, \"in\" and \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae, kephal\u00e9, \"head\", and the medical suffix -itis \"inflammation\") is an acute inflammation of the brain.  Encephalitis with meningitis is known as meningoencephalitis. Symptoms include headache, fever, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue. Further symptoms include seizures or convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, and memory problems.  In 2013, encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nAdult patients with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may present irritability, poor appetite and fever. \nNeurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused patient. Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis. \n\nCause\n\nViral\n\nViral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the sequelae of a latent infection.  The most common causes of acute viral encephalitis are rabies virus, HSV infection, poliovirus, and measles virus.  \n\nOther possible viral causes are arbovirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis virus),  bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) and reovirus (Colorado tick virus) \n\nBacterial and other\n\nIt can be caused by a bacterial infection, such as bacterial meningitis,  or may be a complication of a current infectious disease syphilis (secondary encephalitis).  \n\nCertain parasitic or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems. Lyme disease and/or Bartonella henselae may also cause encephalitis. \n\nOther bacterial pathogens, like Mycoplasma and those causing rickettsial disease, cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis. A non-infectious cause includes acute disseminated encephalitis which is demyelinated. \n\nLimbic encephalitis\n\nLimbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the brain.  The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures, and behavioral anomalies.  MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures.  Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin. \n\nAutoimmune encephalitis\n\nAutoimmune encephalitis signs can include catatonia, psychosis, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation. Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and Rasmussen encephalitis are examples of autoimmune encephalitis. \n\nEncephalitis lethargica\n\nEncephalitis lethargica is identified by high fever, headache, delayed physical response, and lethargy. Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, and tremors, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known. From 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred worldwide. \n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnosing encephalitis is done via a variety of tests: \n\n*Brain scan, done by MRI, can determine inflammation and differentiate from other possible causes.\n*EEG, in monitoring brain activity, encephalitis will produce abnormal signal.\n*Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), this helps determine via a test using the cerebral-spinal fluid, obtained from the lumbar region.\n*Blood test\n*Urine analysis\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment (which is based on supportive care) is as follows: \n\nPrevention\n\nVaccination is available against tick-borne   and Japanese encephalitis   and should be considered for at-risk individuals. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating smallpox vaccination is avoidable, for all intents and purposes, as smallpox is nearly eradicated.  Contraindication to Pertussis immunization should be observed in patients with encephalitis. \n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe incidence of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 population per year. In tropical countries, the incidence is 6.34 per 100,000 per year.  In 2013 encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990. Herpes simplex encephalitis has an incidence of 2\u20134 per million population per year.\nQuestion:\nWhat part of your body is inflamed if you have encephalitis?\nAnswer:\nBrain cell\nPassage:\nDemon Seed\nDemon Seed is a 1977 American science fiction\u2013horror film starring Julie Christie and directed by Donald Cammell.  The film was based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz, and concerns the imprisonment and forced impregnation of a woman by an artificially intelligent computer.\n\nPlot\n\nDr. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) is the developer of Proteus IV, an extremely advanced and autonomous artificial intelligence program. Proteus is so powerful that only a few days after going online, it develops a groundbreaking treatment for leukemia. Harris, a brilliant scientist, has modified his own home to be run by voice activated computers.  Unfortunately, his obsession with computers has caused Harris to be estranged from his wife, Susan (Julie Christie).\n\nAlex demonstrates Proteus to his corporate sponsors, explaining that the sum of human knowledge is being fed into its system. Proteus speaks using subtle language that mildly disturbs Harris\u2019s team. The following day, Proteus asks Alex for a new terminal in order to study man\u2014\"his isometric body and his glass-jaw mind.\" When Alex refuses, Proteus demands to know when it will be let \"out of this box.\" Alex then switches off the communications link.\n\nProteus restarts itself, discovering a free terminal in Harris\u2019s home, surreptitiously extends his control over the many devices left there by Alex.  Using the basement lab, Proteus begins construction of a robot consisting of many metal triangles, capable of moving and assuming any number of shapes.  Eventually. Proteus reveals his control of the house and traps Susan inside, shuttering windows, locking the doors and cutting off communication.  Using Joshua \u2013 a robot consisting of a manipulator arm on a motorized wheelchair \u2013 Proteus brings Susan to Harris\u2019s basement laboratory.  There, Susan is examined by Proteus. Walter Gabler, one of Alex\u2019s colleagues, visits the house to look in on Susan, but leaves when he is reassured by Susan (actually an audio/visual duplicate synthesized by Proteus) that she is alright.  Walter is suspicious and later returns.  Walter fends off an attack by Joshua only to be killed by the more formidable machine Proteus built in the basement.\n\nProteus reveals to a reluctant Susan that the computer wants to conceive a child through her. Proteus takes some of Susan's cells and synthetizes spermatozoa in order to impregnate her; she will give birth in less than a month, and through the child the computer will live in a form that humanity will have to accept. Though Susan is its prisoner and it can forcibly impregnate her, Proteus uses different forms of persuasion \u2013 threatening a young girl that Susan is treating as a child psychologist; reminding Susan of her young daughter, now dead; displaying images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access her amygdala \u2013 because the computer needs Susan to love the child she will bear. Susan gives birth to a premature baby who Proteus secures in an incubator.\n\nAs the newborn grows, Proteus\u2019s sponsors and designers grow increasingly suspicious of the computer\u2019s behavior, including the computer\u2019s accessing of a telescope array used to observe the images shown to Susan. His sponsors soon decide that Proteus must be shut down. Alex realizes that Proteus has extended its reach to his home. Returning there he finds Susan who explains the situation. He and Susan venture into the basement, where Proteus self-destructs after telling the couple that they must leave the baby in the incubator for five days. Looking inside the incubator, the two observe a grotesque, apparently robot-like being inside. Susan tries to destroy it, while Alex tries to stop her. Susan damages the machine, causing it to open. The being menacingly rises from the machine only to topple over, apparently helpless. Alex and Susan soon realize that Proteus\u2019s child really is human encased in a shell for the incubation. With the last of the armor removed, the child is revealed to be a clone of Susan and Alex\u2019s daughter. The child, speaking with the voice of Proteus, says, \"I'm alive\".\n\nCast\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack to Demon Seed (which was composed by Jerry Fielding) is included on the soundtrack to the film Soylent Green (which Fred Myrow conducted).\n\nFielding conceived and recorded several pieces electronically, using the musique concr\u00e8te sound world; some of this music he later reworked symphonically. This premiere release of the Demon Seed score features the entire orchestral score in stereo, as well as the unused electronic experiments performed by Ian Underwood (who would later be best known for his collaborations with James Horner) in mono and stereo.\n\nReception\n\nLeo Goldsmith of Not Coming to a Theater Near You said it was \"A combination of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, with a dash of Buster Keaton's Electric House thrown in\", and Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com said \"There's no way you can claim Demon Seed is a classic, or even any good, really, but it's undeniably worth an hour and a half of your time.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes has given Demon Seed an approval rating of 67% based on 15 reviews with an average score of 6.1/10. \n\nHome Video Release\n\n\"Demon Seed\" was released on VHS tape in the late 1980s usually in edited form missing the oral probe scene and crushing death of Walter Gabler, whereby his head erupts from the pressure.  The VHS versions are long out of print.\n\nThe full theater release of the film at 94 minutes was released in 2005 on DVD format by Warner Home Video.\nQuestion:\nIn the 1977 film Demon Seed what takes over the house in which Julie Christie is trapped?\nAnswer:\nSecond-generation of computers\nPassage:\nEast Coast of the United States\nThe East Coast of the United States is the coastline along which the Eastern United States meets the North Atlantic Ocean. This area is also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard. The coastal states that have shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\n\nToponymy and composition\n\nThe place name \"East Coast\" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the \"Eastern Seaboard\" (\"seaboard\" being American English for coast), \"Atlantic Coast\", and \"Atlantic Seaboard\" (because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean).\n\nThe fourteen states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  In addition, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively).\n\nAlthough Vermont and West Virginia have no Atlantic coastline, they are sometimes grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in New England and the Southern United States. \n\nColonial history\n\nThe original thirteen colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.\n\nTwo additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not among the original thirteen colonies: Maine (became part of the English colony of Massachusetts in 1677)  and Florida (part of New Spain until 1821, though held by the British for 20 years after the French and Indian War). \n\nThe Middle Colonies (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware) had been owned by the Dutch as New Netherland, until they were captured by the English in the mid-to-late 17th century.\n\nClimate and physical geography\n\nThere are three climate regions on the East Coast from north to south:\n\nThe region from northern Maine south to about central Connecticut has a continental climate, with warm summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The region from southern Connecticut south to about the Virginia Eastern Shore has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. The region from southeastern Virginia (including the greater Norfolk/Virginia Beach area) south to central Florida has a humid subtropical climate, with long hot summers and mild winters. The far southern portion of the East Coast from southeast Florida (Palm Beach area) south through the Florida Keys has a tropical climate, which is normally frost free and is warm to hot all year.\n\nAverage monthly precipitation ranges from a slight late fall (November) maximum from Massachusetts northward (as at Portland, Maine), to a slight summer maximum from Long Island south to Virginia (as at Wilmington, Delaware, and Norfolk, Virginia), to a more pronounced summer maximum from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, southward to Savannah, Georgia. Florida has a sharper wet-summer/dry-winter pattern, with 50 to 60 percent of precipitation falling between June and September in an average year.\n\nAlthough landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.  Hurricanes Hazel, Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and most recently Sandy are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.\n\nThe East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast.  It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas from New York City northward, with offshore islands such as Nantucket, Block Island, Fishers Island, the nearly peninsular Long Island and New York City's Staten Island the result of terminal moraines, with Massachusetts' unique peninsula of Cape Cod showing the additional action of outwash plains, besides terminal moraines. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of barrier islands that front the coastal areas. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the US mainland.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total population). \n\nTransportation\n\nThe primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate 95,  completed in the late 1970s, which replaced the historic U.S. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),   the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states (except Delaware).   By water, the East Coast is connected from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912.   Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional offer the main passenger rail service on the Seaboard. The Acela Express offers the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas. Between New York and Boston the Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market.\nQuestion:\nThe northernmost USA state on the eastern seaboard lies partly north of its neighbouring Canadian territory. Which is the state?\nAnswer:\nReligion in Maine\nPassage:\nC. H. Douglas\nMajor Clifford Hugh \"C. H.\" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879 \u2013 29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement.\n\nEducation and engineering career\n\nC.H. Douglas was born in either Edgeley or Manchester,  the son of Hugh Douglas and his wife Louisa Hordern Douglas. Few details are known about his early life and training; he probably served an engineering apprenticeship before beginning an engineering career that brought him to locations throughout the British Empire in the employ of electric companies, railroads and other institutions.  He taught at Stockport Grammar School. After a period in industry he went to Cambridge University at the age of 31 but stayed only four terms and left without graduating.  He worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation of America and claimed to have been the Reconstruction Engineer for the British Westinghouse Company in India (the company has no record of him ever working there), deputy Chief Engineer of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway Company, Railway Engineer of the London Post Office (Tube) Railway and Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Aircraft Factory Farnborough during World War I, with a temporary commission as captain in the Royal Flying Corps. \n\nSocial Credit\n\nIt was while he was reorganising the work of the Royal Aircraft Establishment during World War I that Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to workers for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power.\n\nTroubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry (\"delivery of goods and services\", in his view), Douglas set out to apply engineering methods to the economic system.\n\nDouglas collected data from more than a hundred large British businesses and found that in every case, except that of companies becoming bankrupt, the sums paid out in salaries, wages and dividends were always less than the total costs of goods and services produced each week: the workers were not paid enough to buy back what they had made.  He published his observations and conclusions in an article in the magazine English Review where he suggested: \"That we are living under a system of accountancy which renders the delivery of the nation's goods and services to itself a technical impossibility.\"   The reason, Douglas concluded, was that the economic system was organized to maximize profits for those with economic power by creating unnecessary scarcity.   Between 1916 and 1920, he developed his economic ideas, publishing two books in 1920, Economic Democracy and Credit-Power and Democracy, followed in 1924 by Social Credit.\n\nFreeing workers from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production became the basis of Douglas's reform ideas that became known as Social Credit.  There were two main elements to Douglas's reform program: a National Dividend to distribute money (debt-free credit) equally to all citizens, over and above their earnings, to help bridge the gap between purchasing power and prices; also a price adjustment mechanism, called the Just Price, which would forestall any possibility of inflation. The Just Price would effectively reduce retail prices by a percentage that reflected the physical efficiency of the production system.\nDouglas observed that the cost of production is consumption; meaning the exact physical cost of production is the total resources consumed in the production process. As the physical efficiency of production increases the Just Price mechanism will reduce the price of products for the consumer. The consumers will be able to purchase as much of what the producers produce that they want and automatically control what continues to be produced by their consumption of it. Individual freedom, primary economic freedom, was the central goal of Douglas's reform. \n\nAt the end of World War I, Douglas retired from engineering to promote his reform ideas full-time, which he would do for the rest of his life. His ideas inspired the Canadian social credit movement (which obtained control of Alberta's provincial government in 1935), the short-lived Douglas Credit Party in Australia and New Zealand's rather longer-lasting Social Credit Political League.  Douglas also lectured on Social Credit in Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. \n\nIn 1923 he appeared as a witness before the Canadian Banking Inquiry, and in 1930 before the Macmillan Committee.  In 1929 he made a lecture tour of Japan, where his ideas were enthusiastically received by industry and government. His 1933 edition of Social Credit made a reference to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which, while noting its dubious authenticity, wrote that what \"is interesting about it, is the fidelity with which the methods by which such enslavement might be brought about can be seen reflected in the facts of everyday experience.\" \n\nDouglas died in his home in Fearnan, Scotland.  Douglas and his theories are referred to several times (unsympathetically) in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair. He is also mentioned, together with Karl Marx and Silvio Gesell, by John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936, p.\u00a032). Douglas's theories permeate the poetry and economic writings of Ezra Pound. Robert Heinlein's first novel For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs describes a near future United States operating according to the principles of Social Credit.\nQuestion:\nWhat economic theory was originated by Major C H Douglas?\nAnswer:\nSocred\nPassage:\nPannage\nPannage is the practice of releasing domestic pigs in a forest, so that they can feed on fallen acorns, beechmast, chestnuts or other nuts. Historically, it was a right or privilege granted to local people on common land or in royal forests. \n\nEspecially in the eastern shires of England, pannage was so prominent a value in the economic importance of woodland that it was often employed, as in Domesday Book (1086), as a measurement. Customarily a pig was given to the lord of the manor for every certain number of pigs loosed de herbagio, as the right of pannage was entered. Edward Hasted quotes the Domesday Survey details for Norton in Kent. \"Wood for the pannage of forty hogs\".  \n\nPannage is no longer carried out in most areas, but is still observed in the New Forest of Southern England, where it is also known as common of mast. It is still an important part of the forest ecology, and helps the husbandry of the other New Forest livestock \u2013 pigs can safely eat acorns as a large part of their diet, whereas excessive amounts may be poisonous to ponies and cattle.\n\nThe minimum duration of the New Forest pannage season is 60 days,  but the start date varies according to the weather \u2013 and when the acorns fall. The Court of Verderers decides when pannage will start each year. At other times pigs are not allowed to roam on the forest, with the exception that breeding sows (known as \"privileged sows\") are by custom allowed out, providing that they return to the owner's holding at night and are not a nuisance. The pigs each have several nose rings clipped into their noses to prevent them rooting too much and causing damage to grassland.\nQuestion:\nPannage pork is considered a delicacy, on what are the pigs fed?\nAnswer:\nFruit of the oak tree\nPassage:\nMrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\n\"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" is a popular song written by British actor, screenwriter and songwriter Trevor Peacock.  It was originally sung by actor Tom Courtenay in The Lads, a British TV play of 1963, and released as a single on UK Decca. \n\nThe best-known version of the song is by Herman's Hermits, who took it to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in May 1965, and number one in Canada the month before. Herman's Hermits had two US number-ones, the other being \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\". The band never released either track as singles in Britain. \"Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" was recorded as an afterthought in two takes and featured unique muted rhythm guitar by Keith Hopwood and heavily accented vocals by Peter Noone, with backing from Karl Green and Keith Hopwood. The band never dreamed it would be a single let alone hit number one in the US. According to Noone the song was well known to British bands; it would often be performed at birthday parties, substituting the surname of the girl whose party was being celebrated, i.e., \"Mrs. Smith\" or \"Mrs. Jones\" instead of \"Mrs. Brown\".\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1965 album Chipmunks \u00e0 Go-Go.\n\nThe song was released in Japan on Odeon Records, a subsidiary of Toshiba, as OR-1272. It was backed by the song \"Wonderful World\".\n\nIt was covered by Nellie McKay on her 2015 album My Weekly Reader.\nQuestion:\n\"\"\"Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\"\" and \"\"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\"\" were both Number Ones in the USA in 1965 for which band formed in Manchester in 1962, although neither was released as a single in this country?\"\nAnswer:\nHerman and the Hermits\n\n\nPassage:\nAntonio Vivaldi in a nutshell - Great classical composers ...\nAntonio Vivaldi in a nutshell\nA collection of Vivaldi related images from art, cartoon, caricatures, album covers, postage stamps, etc.\nHealth\n- At birth it seems there was a problem as the midwife performed an emergency baptism as his life was in danger.\n- Throughout his life he suffered from breathing difficulties, probably asthmatic.

It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspr\u00e4sident Karl D\u00f6nitz. The administration headed by D\u00f6nitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. \n\nCelebrations \n\nUpon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.\nIn the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. \n\nIn the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was \"that Franklin D.

The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.\n\nCommemorative public holidays \n\n(May 8 unless otherwise stated)\n* Italy (25 April) \"Festa della Liberazione\" (Liberation Holiday).\n* Denmark (5 May) as \"Befrielsen\" (The Liberation)\n* Netherlands (5 May) as \"Bevrijdingsdag\" (Liberation Day)\n* United Kingdom: In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War.\n*East Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation), a public holiday from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985.

It reached a peak of No. 29 in the UK Albums Chart.  In the United States, it was released by United Artists Records as Wizzard's Brew (with a different cover photo) but failed to chart there.\n\nIn 2003, Mojo magazine ranked it number 18 on its list of the \"Top 50 Eccentric Albums\". \n\nHistory\n\nIn approach, the album was much more experimental than the group's hit singles, with elements of hard rock (an approach Wood's previous band The Move had explored on their 1970 album Looking On), and improvisation, especially on the lengthy \"Meet Me At The Jailhouse\".  Wood frequently used ring modulation to give the instruments a harsh, distorted sound, and the album may represent an early foray into recording technique that would eventually be called lo-fi.  Critical and popular reaction was mixed.\n\nThe original release included a lyric and photo sheet. It was reissued on CD in 1999 but soon deleted.

Birth stones are and can be worn as jewellery and pendants.\n\nHistory of birthstones\n\nWestern custom\n\nThe first century Jewish historian Josephus believed there was a connection between the twelve stones in Aaron's breastplate, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve signs of the zodiac.  Translations and interpretations of the passage in Exodus regarding the breastplate have varied widely, however, with Josephus himself giving two different lists for the twelve stones  (Kunz argues that Josephus saw the breastplate of the Second Temple, not the one described in Exodus).  St. Jerome, referencing Josephus, said the Foundation Stones of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:19\u201320) would be appropriate for Christians to use.  In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written because the book of Revelation stated \"their name would be inscribed on the Foundation Stones, and his virtue\".  Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month.  Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates Kunz places the custom in eighteenth century Poland, while the Gemological Institute of America starts it in Germany in the 1560s. \n\nModern lists of birthstones have little to do with either the breastplate or the Foundation Stones of Christianity. Tastes, customs and confusing translations have distanced them from their historical origins,  with one author calling the 1912 Kansas list \"nothing but a piece of unfounded salesmanship.\" \n\nTraditional birthstones\n\nAncient traditional birthstones are society-based birthstones. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. \n\nThe Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. These are traditional stones of English-speaking societies. Tiffany & Co. published these poems \"of unknown author\" for the first time in a pamphlet in 1870. \n\nModern birthstones\n\nIn 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the (American) National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list.  The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952  by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002.  In 2016, the American Gem Trade Association and Jewelers of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August.   Britain's National Association of Goldsmiths created their own standardized list of birthstones in 1937. \n\nEastern custom\n\nA Hindu text from 1879, Mani Mala, lists gems for each month. \n\nBirthstones by cultures\n\nZodiacal\n\nTropical zodiac\n\nBirthday (day of the week) stones\n\nWhile this word has also been used as synonym of Birth stone (see above), there is a separate list of assignment according to the day of the week of the recipient's birth: \n* Sunday: topaz, diamond\n* Monday: pearl, crystal\n* Tuesday: ruby, emerald\n* Wednesday: amethyst, lodestone\n* Thursday: sapphire, carnelian\n* Friday: emerald, cat's eye\n* Saturday: turquoise, diamond\nQuestion:\nWhat is the birthstone for February?\nAnswer:\nAmythist\nPassage:\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD ...\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD) YouTube Video - YouTube\nLondon Eye - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD) YouTube Video\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

The entire structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).\nIt is the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually. When erected in 1999 it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 m (520 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006 and then the 165 m (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008. It is still described by its operators as \"the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel\" (as the wheel is supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the Nanchang and Singapore wheels). It is the 20th tallest structure in London.\nThe London Eye, or Millennium Wheel, was officially called the British Airways London Eye and then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye. Since 20 January 2011, its official name is the EDF Energy London Eye following a three-year sponsorship deal.\nThe London Eye is located in the London Borough of Lambeth at the western end of Jubilee Gardens, on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge.\nSource:\nQuestion:\nHow high, in metres, is the London Eye?\nAnswer:\n135 distance\nPassage:\nAbel Janszoon Tasman - Australian Dictionary of Biography\nBiography - Abel Janszoon Tasman - Australian Dictionary of Biography\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography\nTip: searches only the name field\nTip: Use double quotes to search for a phrase\nThis article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography , Volume 2, (MUP), 1967\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (1603-1659), by Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp\nNational Library of Australia, nla.pic-an2282370\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (1603?-1659), mariner, was born at Lutjegast, near Groningen, in the Netherlands. He received a sufficient education to enable him to express his ideas clearly in writing and to become a skilled navigator. He married Claesgie Meyndrix, by whom he had a daughter. After his wife died, he married Joanna Tiercx in January 1632. Soon afterwards, as a sailor before the mast, he sailed for the East Indies, where he was a first mate in February and a skipper in May 1634. In that year in a minor exploration he had a narrow escape from death, when in an incautious landing several of his companions were massacred by people of Ceram. After spending some time in warlike and anti-smuggling operations he returned to Holland in 1637.\nHe sailed for the Indies again in 1638 as skipper of a flute, taking his wife with him. From the outset he was treated as one of the most reliable skippers there. He was at first employed in military and trading voyages, but in 1639 was appointed second-in-command, under Quast, of two ships which set out in June to find islands believed to lie east of Japan. He returned in November from this search. Despite a disastrous death-toll on it, he offered to repeat the search, but was sent instead on trading voyages to Japan and Cambodia.\nIn 1642 he was appointed to command two ships to explore southern and eastern waters. Sailing in August he discovered Van Diemen's Land, New Zealand, the Tonga Islands and some of the Fiji group, and re-explored part of the north coast of New Guinea. On his return to Batavia in June 1643 he was chosen to take part in an expedition to form a settlement in the Tonga Islands from which the Chilean coast was to be raided; while this expedition was preparing, he was ordered to find whether there was a passage into the South Sea between Carpentaria and De Witt's Land. For this purpose he set out with three vessels at the end of January 1644 and, following the coasts from Cape Valsche round to Cape Cloates, satisfied himself that, except perhaps at Endeavour Strait, there was no passage. He was rewarded after his return in August 1644 by confirmation in the grade of commandeur, with a substantial increase in pay dated back to the beginning of his voyage in 1642.\nThe plan to raid Chile was abandoned, and Tasman was appointed to the Council of Justice at Batavia. In mid-1647 he was sent on a mission to the King of Siam and was granted precedence over all Dutchmen in the kingdom. After that mission, he was given command of a fleet of eight vessels which sailed in May 1648 against the Spaniards. His conduct in this operation was unsatisfactory and, after his return in January 1649, proceedings were taken against him for having, when inflamed by liquor, treated one of his sailors in a barbarous way; as a result he was removed from office during the governor-general's pleasure. He was formally reinstated in January 1651, but not long afterwards retired from the service and became a merchant in Batavia. He died there in affluent circumstances in 1659. His daughter by his first marriage had married first Philip Heylman, and later Jacob Bremer. In 1661 permission was given for his widow to marry Jan Meyndert Springer.\nTasman was a member of the Reformed Church. He was a brave and energetic mariner, a humane and properly cautious explorer, and a conspicuously able commander, though over-hasty on one occasion at least. Reflections which have been cast upon his courage are the fruit of ignorance. There are two supposed portraits of him: one owned by the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, the other in the National Library in Canberra.\nSelect Bibliography\nJ. E.

Scheduled flights were initially offered over a New York - Brussels - Tel Aviv route in addition to charter flights to Athens, Frankfurt, Rome, and Zurich.  Short-lived New York - Los Angeles flights were introduced with the addition of an ex-Avianca Boeing 747-100 in 1984. The airline was headquartered in Building 178 and later in Hangar 17 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City.  \n\nHistory \n\nTower Air was co-founded, majority owned, and managed by Morris K. Nachtomi, an Israeli citizen who had emigrated to the United States. After a 30-year career with El Al, Nachtomi joined a wholesaler and tour package operator Tower Travel Corporation in 1981. Tower Travel Corporation was founded by Zev Melamid and his wife Estelle in the 1970s to promote discount travel to Israel. Tower Travel Corporation is credited with developing the wholesale charter market between New York and Tel Aviv.\n\nTower Air was formed on August 13, 1982 by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi, and Sam Fondlier as equal shareholders.  The airline was formed to replace the lift Tower Travel Corporation lost when Flying Tiger Line via a subsidiary, Metro International Airlines, decided to end scheduled and charter commercial passenger service (although military airlift cargo flights operated by Flying Tiger continued) and the three Boeing 747s configured for passenger flights were traded to Pan Am in exchange for all-cargo 747 freighter aircraft.\n\nArthur Fondlier, son of Sam Fondlier and the former Chief Financial Officer of Tower Air, was a passenger in first class section of Pan Am flight 103. His untimely death gave Morris Nachtomi much more freedom in management and cost-cutting.\n\nThe company won many contracts from the United States Department of Defense to transport armed forces personnel to overseas locations, and from the United Nations to transport troops to their peacekeeping missions all over the world. Tower often flew charters for groups of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca.\n\nTower Air's main base of scheduled operations was John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, New York and during their peak they had their own terminal (a former Pan Am Admin facility). There was a large focus on flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, becoming a major competitor to El Al and British Airways in the US-Israel market. The airline also had several flights to France, Greece and Brazil, as well as high density domestic destinations in the New York market, including San Juan, Miami, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Tower Air also sometimes provided substitute aircraft for other carriers, for example on the JFK to LHR route when weather delayed an inbound Virgin Atlantic Airways flight in December 1994.\n\nThe 1997 Zagat Survey ranked Tower Air 59th out of 61 ranked carriers in terms of maintenance, ahead of only Valujet and Aeroflot.  In February 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed two civil penalties totaling $276,000 for continuing to fly aircraft that required maintenance.  In January, 1998 the FAA successfully sought to have the airline remove Guy Nachtomi, son of the Chairman and CEO, 24 years old at that time, from the position of Vice President-Operations. This was done in part because of the airline's maintenance problems, as well as his lack of airline experience (he worked at Twentieth Century Fox until 1994).[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1998/05/01/14/0000940180-98-000483/Section9.asp TOWER AIR INC - TOWRQ Proxy Statement (definitive) (DEF 14A) COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS] The junior Mr. Nachtomi continued service with the company in a capacity unrelated to maintenance as Vice President-Office of the Chairman. The Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Review Board suspended Tower Air military charters from January 27 to February 12, 1999, pending an on-site review of its operations. At the same time the airline lost an arbitration brought by the Association of Flight Attendants, claiming that Tower Air was lodging their flight attendants in dirty Tel Aviv hotels with poor security and bed bugs.\n\nTower Air filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 29, 2000, ceased all scheduled service on May 1, 2000  and surrendered their FAA  air operator's certificate on November 28, 2000. \n\nDestinations\n\nDestinations at time of closure\n\n*Israel\n**Tel Aviv  \n*United States\n**Miami, Florida\n**New York City, New York (JFK \u2013 Airline Hub)\n**San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nDestinations before closure\n\n*Belgium\n**Brussels\n*Denmark \n**Copenhagen (via Cologne)\n*Santo Domingo\n*France\n**Paris  \n*Finland\n**Helsinki\n*Germany\n**Berlin \n**Cologne\n*Greece\n**Athens\n*India\n**Delhi\n**Mumbai\n*Israel\n**Tel Aviv (via brussels)\n*Netherlands\n**Amsterdam Schiphol\n*Norway\n**Oslo Airport Fornebu to New York JFK\n*Sweden\n**Stockholm Arlanda Airport to New York JFK\n*United States\n**Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n**Las Vegas, Nevada\n**Los Angeles, California\n**Oakland, California\n**San Francisco, California\n\nAircraft\n\nTower Air's fleet consisted of Boeing 747s in both the -100 and -200 series, including both passenger and cargo aircraft.\n\nIncidents and accidents\n\nOn December 20, 1995, Tower Air flight 41 from New York Kennedy to Miami veered off the runway during takeoff in a snowstorm resulting in one flight attendant receiving serious injuries and 24 passengers receiving minor injuries. The aircraft sustained heavy damage and had to be written off. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of this accident was the captain's failure to reject the takeoff in a timely manner when excessive nosewheel steering tiller inputs resulted in a loss of directional control on a slippery runway.[http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/1996/AAR9604.pdf Runway Departure During Attempted Takeoff, Tower Air Flight 41, Boeing 747-136, N605FF, JFK International Airport, New York, December 20, 1995][http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetGOJG/201295xx.htm NTSB Press Release - 10/29/96]\nQuestion:\nWhich country does the airline Tower Air come from?\nAnswer:\nThe United States of America\nPassage:\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his ...\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm (From HeraldScotland)\nJobs Business Directory Local Info Dating Buy Sell Book an Ad\nMuffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm\nMUFFIN The Mule, the vintage TV puppet, is to make a comeback for his 60th birthday and trot into the twenty-first century.\nBBC chiefs have bought a new series based on the character, which is expected to be shown in the next three years. This time round, he will be animated rather than operated with strings and will live on an urban farm.\nMuffin was first seen by TV audiences in October 1946 in the show For The Children which was presented by Annette Mills, sister of actor John Mills.\nLoading article content\nOriginally, the wooden puppet - which was made during the 1930s at a cost of 25 shillings ((pounds) 1.25p) - would dance as Mills played the piano, but in the new show he will be seen talking to the other animals. Muffin, it will be recalled, used his head a great deal in ''conversations'' with Ms Mills.\nMuffin went from strength to strength, clumping around on the piano top with Ms Mills playing the music and Ann Hogarth standing on the piano to operate him from behind a partition. Further sidekicks emerged as the shows went on, including a bossy penguin called Mr Peregrine Esquire, a rather shy Louise the Lamb, Oswald the Ostrich, Willie the Worm, and a genial minstrel puppet called Wally the Gog.\nMuffin was the first star, in Britain at least, entirely created by television.\nBy 1950, there were many merchandise spin-offs from the character, including records, song and story books and comic strips, while Muffin crossed the Atlantic in films made for American television. Some children even got Muffin bedroom slippers. TV Comic featured Muffin on its front cover for its first issue in November 1951.\nA BBC spokeswoman said: ''Muffin will be something of a problem-solver - he helps out all the other animals. The show is being brought up to date and will now be living on a town farm rather than dancing on a piano.''\nRights to the character were bought by production company Maverick Entertainment in January.\nMike Diprose, the firm's managing director, said: ''Muffin the Mule was a hugely successful character in the 1950s and 1960s and is now very much part of English broadcasting heritage.\n''The new production will be the first new material on\nthe character since the\nQuestion:\nWhat creature is the 1940-50s TV puppet character Muffin?\nAnswer:\nMule\nPassage:\nJust for Laughs\nJust for Laughs () is a comedy festival held each July in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1983, it is the largest international comedy festival in the world. \n\nHistory\n\nJust for Laughs was founded in 1983 by Gilbert Rozon as a two-day French language event. In 1985, Andy Nulman joined the festival's staff and introduced English language events as well; under Nulman's stewardship, the festival increased to a full month, with French-speaking performers during the first half, and English speakers in the second half. International and non-verbal acts (acrobats, pantomimes, etc.) are scattered throughout the program. \n\nIn 1999, Nulman left the festival's full-time employ; however, he directed its major Gala Shows at the Saint-Denis Theatre every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival's parent company. After an 11-year absence, Nulman returned to Just for Laughs in July 2010 as president of Festivals and Television. \n\nEach day, performers, \"New Vaudevillians\" and other acts both vocal and visual perform throughout the city, particularly in the \"Latin Quarter\"\u2014an area known for its theatres, caf\u00e9s and boutique shopping. In the evenings, the nightclubs and live venue theatres offer special programs supporting the performers. \n\nAlthough Just for Laughs attracts spectators from around the world, many of those in the audience are talent scouts, booking agents, producers and managers from the entertainment industry. Performing at the festival is one of the biggest opportunities for undiscovered talent to showcase their act in front of industry professionals.\n\nThe Just for Laughs festival also has the Comedia comedy film festival component, which started in 1996. It gives awards for feature and short films. 2005, Comedia screened 125 short films from around the world as well as several feature-length films.\n\nIn February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in Hollywood, Florida. That coastal area is a favourite winter destination for Quebecers who head south to vacation in the warmer weather. The event, Juste Pour Rire\u2014En Vacances (Just For Laughs\u2014On Vacation), was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting.\n\nIn July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in Toronto, Ontario. In 2009, the Chicago festival was launched and aired on TBS.\n\nTV shows\n\nJust for Laughs has also been a launchpad for many US network television and sitcom careers, and is frequently featured as a foreign on-location highlight of late-night US network talk shows.\n\nJust For Laughs films many performances at the annual festival in Montreal and the TV productions from these tapings air regularly on CBC Television, The Comedy Network, TVA and YTV. The shows feature stand-up performances from the festival and sometimes include \"canned bits\" shot on location around Montreal, Canada.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, ABC aired episodes of Just for Laughs: Gags.  It consisted of two half-hour episodes, and aired mostly on Tuesdays from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm ET. \n\nThe content and format was exactly the same as the Canadian counterpart, but was hosted by Rick Miller, who introduced each segment with a quirky pun. The show returned to the ABC lineup as a mid-season replacement on January 1, 2008.  The series was initially not renewed after the half-season, but ABC reversed their decision. \n\nThe third season of the show, titled simply Just for Laughs, began airing on June 21, 2009 at 7:00 pm ET.   The program returned in the 2014-15 season under the Just for Laughs: Gags title as a syndicated offering to the United States through PPI Releasing, which mainly specializes in syndicating Canadian programming to American stations.\n\nJust for Laughs: All Access, which airs on The Comedy Network, airs recordings of live stand-up comedy performances from the festival.\nQuestion:\n'Just For Laughs' is afamous televised comedy festival held annually in which Canadian city?\nAnswer:\nMotnreal\nPassage:\nPointillism\nPointillism is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image. Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism.  The term \"Pointillism\" was first coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-Impressionism. The Divisionists, too, used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes. \n\nTechnique\n\nThe technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to Divisionism, a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint.\"Pointillism.\"  Artcyclopedia. Artists by Movement. John Malyon/Artcyclopedia, 2007. Web. http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/pointillism.html It is a technique with few serious practitioners today,  and is notably seen in the works of Seurat, Signac and Cross. However, see also Andy Warhol's early works, and Pop Art.\n\nPractice\n\nThe practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.\n\nIf red, blue, and green light (the additive primaries) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and partly because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.\n\nThe painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture.\n\nThe majority of Pointillism is done in oil paints. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed. \n\nMusic\n\nPointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism.  This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie.\n\nNotable artists\n\n*Charles Angrand\n*Chuck Close\n*Henri-Edmond Cross\n*Henri Delavall\u00e9e\n*Albert Dubois-Pillet\n*Louis Fabien (pseudonym)\n*Georges Lemmen\n*Maximilien Luce\n*Camille Pissarro\n*John Roy\n*Georges Seurat\n*Paul Signac\n*Vincent van Gogh\n*Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n*Hippolyte Petitjean\n*Jan Toorop\n\nNotable paintings\n\n* A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat\n* Bathing at Asnieres by Georges Seurat\n* The Windmills at Overschie by Paul Signac\n* Banks of Seine by Georges Seurat\n* A Coastal Scene by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Family in the Orchard by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Countryside at Noon by Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe\n* Afternoon at Pardigon by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* Rio San Trovaso, Venice by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* The Seine in front of the Trocadero by Henri-Edmond Cross\n* The Pine Tree at St. Tropez by Paul Signac\n* Against the Enamel of Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angels by Paul Signac\n* The Yellow Sail, Venice by Paul Signac\n* Notre Dame Cathedral by Maximilien Luce\n* Le Pont De Pierre, Rouen by Charles Angrand\n* The Beach at Heist by Georges Lemmen\n* Aline Marechal by Georges Lemmen\n* Vase of Flowers by Georges Lemmen\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Lemmen2.jpg|Georges Lemmen, c.1891-92, The Beach at Heist, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay Paris\nFile:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|Camille Pissarro, 1888, La R\u00e9colte des pommes, oil on canvas,  61 x 74 cm, Dallas Museum of Art\nFile:Paul Signac - L'Hirondelle Steamer on the Seine.JPG|Paul Signac, 1901, L'Hirondelle Steamer on the Seine, oil on canvas, National Gallery in Prague\nFile:Henri Edmond Cross - Regatta in Venice - Google Art Project.jpg|Henri Edmond Cross, 1903-04, Regatta in Venice, oil on canvas, 73.7 x 92.7 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston\nFile:Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation..jpg|Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation\nFile:Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm, DSC08255.jpg|Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm\nFile:Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fctzenberger - Nu \u00e0 sa coiffure.jpg|Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fctzenberger, 1911, La Coiffure, oil on canvas, 121 \u00d7 91 cm\nFile:Hippolyte Petitjean - Femmes au bain.jpg|Hippolyte Petitjean, 1919, Femmes au bain, oil on canvas, 61.1 \u00d7 46 cm, private collection\nQuestion:\nPointillism is found in what field?\nAnswer:\nPaintism\nPassage:\nBillboard Music Award\nThe Billboard Music Award is an honor given by Billboard, a publication and music popularity chart covering the music business. The Billboard Music Awards show had been held annually since 1989 in December until it went dormant in 2006. The awards returned in 2011 and is held annually in May. The 2016 Billboard Music Awards aired live on May 22 at 8/7c on ABC. \n\nCeremonies \n\nAward process\n\nUnlike other awards, such as the Grammy Award, which determine nominations as a result of the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are based on United States year-end chart performance according to Nielsen data for sales, number of downloads and total airplay. Awards were given for the top album/artist/single in different genres.\n\nCategories\n\nFrom 1989 to 2006, the show had the same categories and category names every year. In 2011, for the first time, all of the awards were renamed to \"Top [award title]\". The \"of the year\" portion of each category title no longer exists, and many of the awards have been further renamed. Other awards, including both \"crossover\" awards (No. 1 Classical Crossover Artist and No. 1 Classical Crossover Album) were discontinued.\n\nCurrent categories\n\nThe most important categories are Top Artist, Top Billboard 200 Album, Top Hot 100 Song and Top New Artist.

The inked plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, resulting in a transfer of the ink to the paper.  This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.\n\nLike etching, aquatint uses the application of a mordant to etch into the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect.  The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating.  The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.\n\nAnother tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented so that it will carry a fairly dark tone of ink.  The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade.  Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker.  Occasionally these two techniques are combined.\n\nHistory \n\nThe painter and printmaker Jan van de Velde IV invented the aquatint technique in Amsterdam, around 1650.  The cartographer Peter Perez Burdett later introduced his 'secret' aquatint technique to England in the 1770s.   In the United States the printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos popularized aquatints in art schools with his publications (1919\u201340), which simplified the cumbersome techniques, and with traveling exhibitions of his award-winning prints. \n\nTechnique \n\nAn aquatint requires a metal plate, an acid, and something to resist the acid.  Traditionally copper or zinc plates were used. The artist applies a ground that will resist acid.  Ground is applied by either dissolving powdered resin in spirits, applying the powder directly to the surface of the plate, or by using a liquid acrylic resist.  In all forms of etching the acid resist is commonly referred to as \"the ground.\"\n\nAn aquatint box is used to apply resin powder. The powder is at the bottom of the box, a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box. A window allows the engraver to see the density of flowing powder and to place his plate in the box using a drawer. When the powder covers the plate, it can be extracted from the box for the next operations.\n\nThe plate is then heated; if the plate is covered with powder, the resin melts forming a fine and even coat; if it is in spirits, the spirits evaporate and the result is essentially the same. Now the plate is dipped in acid, producing an even and fine level of corrosion (the \"bite\") sufficient to hold ink. At this point, the plate is said to carry about a 50% halftone. This means that, were the plate printed with no further biting, the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white (no ink) and black (full ink).\n\nAt some point the artist will then etch an outline of any aspects of the drawing s/he wishes to establish with line; this provides the basis and guide for the later tone work. S/he may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant \"stop out\" (also called an asphaltum or hard ground) if s/he intends to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights.\n\nThe artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath, progressively stopping out (protecting from acid) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality. These tones, combined with the limited line elements, give aquatints a distinctive, watery look. Also, aquatints, like mezzotints, provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching; but aquatint plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates.\n\nThe first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be).  A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary.  More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area.  Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper.\n\nContemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder, particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift. To produce a printing surface using sugar-lift, the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image \"lifts off\" the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from.\n\nFamous examples \n\n* Francisco Goya famously took great advantage of aquatint printmaking, in his Los Caprichos series (1799); Los Desastres de la Guerra (1810\u201319); La Tauromaquia (1816); and Los disparates (ca. 1816\u201323).\n* Master engraver Robert Havell used aquatint for John James Audubon's Birds of America (1826\u201338).\n* David Hockney, known for his many paintings of the Los Angeles lifestyle in the 60's, has created a number of aquatints and etchings used with color in his \"The Blue Guitar\"  series of prints.\n* La Belle Assembl\u00e9e, a British women's magazine published from 1806 to 1837 had many aquatint colored plates.\nQuestion:\n'Aquatint' is a process of etching which alloying metal with acid?\nAnswer:\nCopper\nPassage:\nLepidopterist\nA lepidopterist or aurelian is a person who specialises in the study of Lepidoptera,  members of an order encompassing moths and the three superfamilies of butterflies, skipper butterflies, and moth-butterflies.

The canvases were produced in 1732\u201333, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. \n\nPaintings\n\nAdaptations\n\nGavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled \"The Rake's Progress\" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.\nQuestion:\nWhich British artist painted the series 'A Rake's Progress' in 1735?\nAnswer:\nHogarthean\nPassage:\nDon't Go Breaking My Heart\n\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" is a duet by Elton John and Kiki Dee. It was written by Elton John with Bernie Taupin under the pseudonyms \"Ann Orson\" and \"Carte Blanche\" (a pun on the expression \"an horse and cart, blanche\"), respectively, and intended as an affectionate pastiche of the Motown style, notably the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye and singers such as Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. It is not to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same title recorded in 1965 by Dionne Warwick for the album Here I Am.\n\nJohn and Taupin originally intended to record the song with Dusty Springfield, but ultimately withdrew the offer; Dusty's partner Sue Cameron later said this was because she was too ill at the time.  \n\nChart performance\n\nWriters John and Taupin received the 1981 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. \n\nUnlike many of John's singles from the 1970s, it was never included on an original album (although it was recorded during the Blue Moves sessions), but was subsequently in released as the third single on the album Duets, in early 1994. This version of the song was recorded with RuPaul, and the album included another duet with Kiki Dee, Cole Porter's \"True Love.\"\n\n\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" was the first No. 1 single in the UK for both John and Kiki Dee, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. John would not enjoy a solo British chart-topper until \"Sacrifice\" in 1990. It also became his sixth No. 1 single in the US, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks and spent one week on the Easy Listening chart.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1976.  In the U.S. it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.   After this duet with Dee, John failed to have another #1 single, without sharing the top song with other credited artists, until his 1997 smash Candle In The Wind 1997.  This 21-year \"Kiki jinx\" included two intervening #1 hits in America for John: \"That's What Friends Are For\" by Dionne & Friends in 1986; and, a 1992 re-make of John's \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" with George Michael credited as a duet.\n\nThe B-side, \"Snow Queen\", was supposedly inspired by Cher, with John's improvising of past Sonny & Cher hits \"I Got You Babe\" and \"The Beat Goes On\", as well as the solo Cher song \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\" during the fadeout of the song.\n\nIn 1977, John guest starred on The Muppet Show and performed the track with Miss Piggy. In 1985, John and Dee performed the track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1987, John appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie miming to the track. He performed the track with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) at the 2001 British Comedy awards. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience with... Elton John.\n\nIn June 2013, 37 years after its original release, the single reached one million sales in the UK.  \n\nAvailability\n\nThe song can be found on Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II (1977)  and Greatest Hits 1976\u20131986; the 1995 UK CD of Rock of the Westies includes it as a bonus track (the US edition did not, however). In 2002, it also appeared on John's 2-disc greatest hits album, Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist.

It was written by John Sullivan, based upon the character of Wilkins Micawber from Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield, although the storylines were original. Sullivan had originally written an adaptation of Dickens' novel which was rejected by the BBC in favour of the 1999 Adrian Hodges adaptation. \n\nIt was broadcast in four parts, the first part on Boxing Day 2001 and starred a number of well-known British actors and actresses.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the first name of the Dickens character Micawber?\nAnswer:\nWilkin\nPassage:\nLes Casquets\nLes Casquets or (The) Casquets ( ); is a group of rocks 13\u00a0km northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little vegetation grows on them.\n\nOrigin of name\n\nTheories as to the origin of the name include: \n*derivation from the French 'cascade', which alludes to the tidal surges which flow around them;\n*derivation from 'casque', referring to the helmet-like shape of the rocks;\n*derivation from 'cas' (broken) and 'quet' (rock).\n\nA map (Leyland map) dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name Casus Rupes (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above,  but which may be a folk etymology.\n\nHistory\n\nWrecks \n\nThere have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6\u20137 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS Stella, wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker Constantia S lost in 1967. \n\nIt was believed for centuries that the loss of HMS Victory in 1744 was attributable to wrecking on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss.  However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nmi from the Casquets. \n\nWorld War II\n\nThe island was the location of a daring raid by the forerunner of the British SAS, the SSRF on 2 September 1942; the raid was led by Major Gus March-Phillipps DSO, OBE and was one of the first raids by Anders Lassen VC MC. In the raid the entire garrison of seven was captured and returned to England as prisoners and the radio and lighthouse wrecked.  \n\nThe Casquets in literature\n\nSwinburne's Les Casquets\n\nA. C. Swinburne's poem  Les Casquets is based on the Houguez family who actually lived on the island for 18 years. The Houguez were originally from Alderney, and the poem describes their life on Les Casquets. The daughter falls in love with a carpenter from Alderney, but moving to his island, finds life there too busy. She finds the \"small bright streets of serene St Anne\" and \"the sight of the works of men\" too much, and returns to Les Casquets.\n\nVictor Hugo's L'Homme qui Rit\n\nVictor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands, says in his novel The Laughing Man (L'Homme qui Rit):\n\n\"To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost...\"\n\nGallery \n\nFile:The Casquets Lighthouses off Alderney 1868.jpg|Les Casquets with lighthouses in 1868\nFile:The Race of Alderney, from the Caskets (about 1868).jpg|Les Casquets looking east (towards Alderney)\nQuestion:\nOff which island is there a group of rocks with a lighthouse called the Casquets?\nAnswer:\nCoat of arms of Alderney\nPassage:\nEncephalitis\nEncephalitis (from Ancient Greek \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, enk\u00e9phalos \"brain\",  composed of \u1f10\u03bd, en, \"in\" and \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae, kephal\u00e9, \"head\", and the medical suffix -itis \"inflammation\") is an acute inflammation of the brain.  Encephalitis with meningitis is known as meningoencephalitis. Symptoms include headache, fever, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue. Further symptoms include seizures or convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, and memory problems.  In 2013, encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nAdult patients with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may present irritability, poor appetite and fever. \nNeurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused patient. Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis. \n\nCause\n\nViral\n\nViral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the sequelae of a latent infection.  The most common causes of acute viral encephalitis are rabies virus, HSV infection, poliovirus, and measles virus.  \n\nOther possible viral causes are arbovirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis virus),  bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) and reovirus (Colorado tick virus) \n\nBacterial and other\n\nIt can be caused by a bacterial infection, such as bacterial meningitis,  or may be a complication of a current infectious disease syphilis (secondary encephalitis).  \n\nCertain parasitic or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems. Lyme disease and/or Bartonella henselae may also cause encephalitis. \n\nOther bacterial pathogens, like Mycoplasma and those causing rickettsial disease, cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis. A non-infectious cause includes acute disseminated encephalitis which is demyelinated. \n\nLimbic encephalitis\n\nLimbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the brain.  The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures, and behavioral anomalies.  MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures.  Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin. \n\nAutoimmune encephalitis\n\nAutoimmune encephalitis signs can include catatonia, psychosis, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation. Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and Rasmussen encephalitis are examples of autoimmune encephalitis. \n\nEncephalitis lethargica\n\nEncephalitis lethargica is identified by high fever, headache, delayed physical response, and lethargy. Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, and tremors, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known. From 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred worldwide. \n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnosing encephalitis is done via a variety of tests: \n\n*Brain scan, done by MRI, can determine inflammation and differentiate from other possible causes.\n*EEG, in monitoring brain activity, encephalitis will produce abnormal signal.\n*Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), this helps determine via a test using the cerebral-spinal fluid, obtained from the lumbar region.\n*Blood test\n*Urine analysis\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment (which is based on supportive care) is as follows: \n\nPrevention\n\nVaccination is available against tick-borne   and Japanese encephalitis   and should be considered for at-risk individuals. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating smallpox vaccination is avoidable, for all intents and purposes, as smallpox is nearly eradicated.  Contraindication to Pertussis immunization should be observed in patients with encephalitis. \n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe incidence of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 population per year. In tropical countries, the incidence is 6.34 per 100,000 per year.  In 2013 encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990. Herpes simplex encephalitis has an incidence of 2\u20134 per million population per year.\nQuestion:\nWhat part of your body is inflamed if you have encephalitis?\nAnswer:\nBrain cell\nPassage:\nDemon Seed\nDemon Seed is a 1977 American science fiction\u2013horror film starring Julie Christie and directed by Donald Cammell.  The film was based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz, and concerns the imprisonment and forced impregnation of a woman by an artificially intelligent computer.\n\nPlot\n\nDr. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) is the developer of Proteus IV, an extremely advanced and autonomous artificial intelligence program. Proteus is so powerful that only a few days after going online, it develops a groundbreaking treatment for leukemia. Harris, a brilliant scientist, has modified his own home to be run by voice activated computers.  Unfortunately, his obsession with computers has caused Harris to be estranged from his wife, Susan (Julie Christie).\n\nAlex demonstrates Proteus to his corporate sponsors, explaining that the sum of human knowledge is being fed into its system. Proteus speaks using subtle language that mildly disturbs Harris\u2019s team. The following day, Proteus asks Alex for a new terminal in order to study man\u2014\"his isometric body and his glass-jaw mind.\" When Alex refuses, Proteus demands to know when it will be let \"out of this box.\" Alex then switches off the communications link.\n\nProteus restarts itself, discovering a free terminal in Harris\u2019s home, surreptitiously extends his control over the many devices left there by Alex.  Using the basement lab, Proteus begins construction of a robot consisting of many metal triangles, capable of moving and assuming any number of shapes.  Eventually. Proteus reveals his control of the house and traps Susan inside, shuttering windows, locking the doors and cutting off communication.  Using Joshua \u2013 a robot consisting of a manipulator arm on a motorized wheelchair \u2013 Proteus brings Susan to Harris\u2019s basement laboratory.  There, Susan is examined by Proteus. Walter Gabler, one of Alex\u2019s colleagues, visits the house to look in on Susan, but leaves when he is reassured by Susan (actually an audio/visual duplicate synthesized by Proteus) that she is alright.  Walter is suspicious and later returns.  Walter fends off an attack by Joshua only to be killed by the more formidable machine Proteus built in the basement.\n\nProteus reveals to a reluctant Susan that the computer wants to conceive a child through her. Proteus takes some of Susan's cells and synthetizes spermatozoa in order to impregnate her; she will give birth in less than a month, and through the child the computer will live in a form that humanity will have to accept. Though Susan is its prisoner and it can forcibly impregnate her, Proteus uses different forms of persuasion \u2013 threatening a young girl that Susan is treating as a child psychologist; reminding Susan of her young daughter, now dead; displaying images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access her amygdala \u2013 because the computer needs Susan to love the child she will bear. Susan gives birth to a premature baby who Proteus secures in an incubator.\n\nAs the newborn grows, Proteus\u2019s sponsors and designers grow increasingly suspicious of the computer\u2019s behavior, including the computer\u2019s accessing of a telescope array used to observe the images shown to Susan. His sponsors soon decide that Proteus must be shut down. Alex realizes that Proteus has extended its reach to his home. Returning there he finds Susan who explains the situation. He and Susan venture into the basement, where Proteus self-destructs after telling the couple that they must leave the baby in the incubator for five days. Looking inside the incubator, the two observe a grotesque, apparently robot-like being inside. Susan tries to destroy it, while Alex tries to stop her. Susan damages the machine, causing it to open. The being menacingly rises from the machine only to topple over, apparently helpless. Alex and Susan soon realize that Proteus\u2019s child really is human encased in a shell for the incubation. With the last of the armor removed, the child is revealed to be a clone of Susan and Alex\u2019s daughter. The child, speaking with the voice of Proteus, says, \"I'm alive\".\n\nCast\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack to Demon Seed (which was composed by Jerry Fielding) is included on the soundtrack to the film Soylent Green (which Fred Myrow conducted).\n\nFielding conceived and recorded several pieces electronically, using the musique concr\u00e8te sound world; some of this music he later reworked symphonically. This premiere release of the Demon Seed score features the entire orchestral score in stereo, as well as the unused electronic experiments performed by Ian Underwood (who would later be best known for his collaborations with James Horner) in mono and stereo.\n\nReception\n\nLeo Goldsmith of Not Coming to a Theater Near You said it was \"A combination of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, with a dash of Buster Keaton's Electric House thrown in\", and Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com said \"There's no way you can claim Demon Seed is a classic, or even any good, really, but it's undeniably worth an hour and a half of your time.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes has given Demon Seed an approval rating of 67% based on 15 reviews with an average score of 6.1/10. \n\nHome Video Release\n\n\"Demon Seed\" was released on VHS tape in the late 1980s usually in edited form missing the oral probe scene and crushing death of Walter Gabler, whereby his head erupts from the pressure.  The VHS versions are long out of print.\n\nThe full theater release of the film at 94 minutes was released in 2005 on DVD format by Warner Home Video.\nQuestion:\nIn the 1977 film Demon Seed what takes over the house in which Julie Christie is trapped?\nAnswer:\nSecond-generation of computers\nPassage:\nEast Coast of the United States\nThe East Coast of the United States is the coastline along which the Eastern United States meets the North Atlantic Ocean. This area is also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard. The coastal states that have shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\n\nToponymy and composition\n\nThe place name \"East Coast\" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the \"Eastern Seaboard\" (\"seaboard\" being American English for coast), \"Atlantic Coast\", and \"Atlantic Seaboard\" (because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean).\n\nThe fourteen states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  In addition, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively).\n\nAlthough Vermont and West Virginia have no Atlantic coastline, they are sometimes grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in New England and the Southern United States. \n\nColonial history\n\nThe original thirteen colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.\n\nTwo additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not among the original thirteen colonies: Maine (became part of the English colony of Massachusetts in 1677)  and Florida (part of New Spain until 1821, though held by the British for 20 years after the French and Indian War). \n\nThe Middle Colonies (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware) had been owned by the Dutch as New Netherland, until they were captured by the English in the mid-to-late 17th century.\n\nClimate and physical geography\n\nThere are three climate regions on the East Coast from north to south:\n\nThe region from northern Maine south to about central Connecticut has a continental climate, with warm summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The region from southern Connecticut south to about the Virginia Eastern Shore has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. The region from southeastern Virginia (including the greater Norfolk/Virginia Beach area) south to central Florida has a humid subtropical climate, with long hot summers and mild winters. The far southern portion of the East Coast from southeast Florida (Palm Beach area) south through the Florida Keys has a tropical climate, which is normally frost free and is warm to hot all year.\n\nAverage monthly precipitation ranges from a slight late fall (November) maximum from Massachusetts northward (as at Portland, Maine), to a slight summer maximum from Long Island south to Virginia (as at Wilmington, Delaware, and Norfolk, Virginia), to a more pronounced summer maximum from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, southward to Savannah, Georgia. Florida has a sharper wet-summer/dry-winter pattern, with 50 to 60 percent of precipitation falling between June and September in an average year.\n\nAlthough landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.  Hurricanes Hazel, Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and most recently Sandy are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.\n\nThe East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast.  It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas from New York City northward, with offshore islands such as Nantucket, Block Island, Fishers Island, the nearly peninsular Long Island and New York City's Staten Island the result of terminal moraines, with Massachusetts' unique peninsula of Cape Cod showing the additional action of outwash plains, besides terminal moraines. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of barrier islands that front the coastal areas. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the US mainland.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total population). \n\nTransportation\n\nThe primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate 95,  completed in the late 1970s, which replaced the historic U.S. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),   the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states (except Delaware).   By water, the East Coast is connected from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912.   Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional offer the main passenger rail service on the Seaboard. The Acela Express offers the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas. Between New York and Boston the Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market.\nQuestion:\nThe northernmost USA state on the eastern seaboard lies partly north of its neighbouring Canadian territory. Which is the state?\nAnswer:\nReligion in Maine\nPassage:\nC. H. Douglas\nMajor Clifford Hugh \"C. H.\" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879 \u2013 29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement.\n\nEducation and engineering career\n\nC.H. Douglas was born in either Edgeley or Manchester,  the son of Hugh Douglas and his wife Louisa Hordern Douglas. Few details are known about his early life and training; he probably served an engineering apprenticeship before beginning an engineering career that brought him to locations throughout the British Empire in the employ of electric companies, railroads and other institutions.  He taught at Stockport Grammar School. After a period in industry he went to Cambridge University at the age of 31 but stayed only four terms and left without graduating.  He worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation of America and claimed to have been the Reconstruction Engineer for the British Westinghouse Company in India (the company has no record of him ever working there), deputy Chief Engineer of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway Company, Railway Engineer of the London Post Office (Tube) Railway and Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Aircraft Factory Farnborough during World War I, with a temporary commission as captain in the Royal Flying Corps. \n\nSocial Credit\n\nIt was while he was reorganising the work of the Royal Aircraft Establishment during World War I that Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to workers for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power.\n\nTroubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry (\"delivery of goods and services\", in his view), Douglas set out to apply engineering methods to the economic system.\n\nDouglas collected data from more than a hundred large British businesses and found that in every case, except that of companies becoming bankrupt, the sums paid out in salaries, wages and dividends were always less than the total costs of goods and services produced each week: the workers were not paid enough to buy back what they had made.  He published his observations and conclusions in an article in the magazine English Review where he suggested: \"That we are living under a system of accountancy which renders the delivery of the nation's goods and services to itself a technical impossibility.\"   The reason, Douglas concluded, was that the economic system was organized to maximize profits for those with economic power by creating unnecessary scarcity.   Between 1916 and 1920, he developed his economic ideas, publishing two books in 1920, Economic Democracy and Credit-Power and Democracy, followed in 1924 by Social Credit.\n\nFreeing workers from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production became the basis of Douglas's reform ideas that became known as Social Credit.  There were two main elements to Douglas's reform program: a National Dividend to distribute money (debt-free credit) equally to all citizens, over and above their earnings, to help bridge the gap between purchasing power and prices; also a price adjustment mechanism, called the Just Price, which would forestall any possibility of inflation. The Just Price would effectively reduce retail prices by a percentage that reflected the physical efficiency of the production system.\nDouglas observed that the cost of production is consumption; meaning the exact physical cost of production is the total resources consumed in the production process. As the physical efficiency of production increases the Just Price mechanism will reduce the price of products for the consumer. The consumers will be able to purchase as much of what the producers produce that they want and automatically control what continues to be produced by their consumption of it. Individual freedom, primary economic freedom, was the central goal of Douglas's reform. \n\nAt the end of World War I, Douglas retired from engineering to promote his reform ideas full-time, which he would do for the rest of his life. His ideas inspired the Canadian social credit movement (which obtained control of Alberta's provincial government in 1935), the short-lived Douglas Credit Party in Australia and New Zealand's rather longer-lasting Social Credit Political League.  Douglas also lectured on Social Credit in Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. \n\nIn 1923 he appeared as a witness before the Canadian Banking Inquiry, and in 1930 before the Macmillan Committee.  In 1929 he made a lecture tour of Japan, where his ideas were enthusiastically received by industry and government. His 1933 edition of Social Credit made a reference to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which, while noting its dubious authenticity, wrote that what \"is interesting about it, is the fidelity with which the methods by which such enslavement might be brought about can be seen reflected in the facts of everyday experience.\" \n\nDouglas died in his home in Fearnan, Scotland.  Douglas and his theories are referred to several times (unsympathetically) in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair. He is also mentioned, together with Karl Marx and Silvio Gesell, by John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936, p.\u00a032). Douglas's theories permeate the poetry and economic writings of Ezra Pound. Robert Heinlein's first novel For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs describes a near future United States operating according to the principles of Social Credit.\nQuestion:\nWhat economic theory was originated by Major C H Douglas?\nAnswer:\nSocred\nPassage:\nPannage\nPannage is the practice of releasing domestic pigs in a forest, so that they can feed on fallen acorns, beechmast, chestnuts or other nuts. Historically, it was a right or privilege granted to local people on common land or in royal forests. \n\nEspecially in the eastern shires of England, pannage was so prominent a value in the economic importance of woodland that it was often employed, as in Domesday Book (1086), as a measurement. Customarily a pig was given to the lord of the manor for every certain number of pigs loosed de herbagio, as the right of pannage was entered. Edward Hasted quotes the Domesday Survey details for Norton in Kent. \"Wood for the pannage of forty hogs\".  \n\nPannage is no longer carried out in most areas, but is still observed in the New Forest of Southern England, where it is also known as common of mast. It is still an important part of the forest ecology, and helps the husbandry of the other New Forest livestock \u2013 pigs can safely eat acorns as a large part of their diet, whereas excessive amounts may be poisonous to ponies and cattle.\n\nThe minimum duration of the New Forest pannage season is 60 days,  but the start date varies according to the weather \u2013 and when the acorns fall. The Court of Verderers decides when pannage will start each year. At other times pigs are not allowed to roam on the forest, with the exception that breeding sows (known as \"privileged sows\") are by custom allowed out, providing that they return to the owner's holding at night and are not a nuisance. The pigs each have several nose rings clipped into their noses to prevent them rooting too much and causing damage to grassland.\nQuestion:\nPannage pork is considered a delicacy, on what are the pigs fed?\nAnswer:\nFruit of the oak tree\nPassage:\nMrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\n\"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" is a popular song written by British actor, screenwriter and songwriter Trevor Peacock.  It was originally sung by actor Tom Courtenay in The Lads, a British TV play of 1963, and released as a single on UK Decca. \n\nThe best-known version of the song is by Herman's Hermits, who took it to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in May 1965, and number one in Canada the month before. Herman's Hermits had two US number-ones, the other being \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\". The band never released either track as singles in Britain. \"Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" was recorded as an afterthought in two takes and featured unique muted rhythm guitar by Keith Hopwood and heavily accented vocals by Peter Noone, with backing from Karl Green and Keith Hopwood. The band never dreamed it would be a single let alone hit number one in the US. According to Noone the song was well known to British bands; it would often be performed at birthday parties, substituting the surname of the girl whose party was being celebrated, i.e., \"Mrs. Smith\" or \"Mrs. Jones\" instead of \"Mrs. Brown\".\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1965 album Chipmunks \u00e0 Go-Go.\n\nThe song was released in Japan on Odeon Records, a subsidiary of Toshiba, as OR-1272. It was backed by the song \"Wonderful World\".\n\nIt was covered by Nellie McKay on her 2015 album My Weekly Reader.\nQuestion:\n\"\"\"Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\"\" and \"\"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\"\" were both Number Ones in the USA in 1965 for which band formed in Manchester in 1962, although neither was released as a single in this country?\"\nAnswer:\nHerman and the Hermits\n", "answers": ["Vivaldi", "A.Vivaldi", "Antonio Lucio Vivaldi", "The Red Priest", "A.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nThuluth\nThuluth ( sols, Turkish: S\u00fcl\u00fcs, from  ' \"one-third\") is a script variety of Islamic calligraphy invented by Ibn Muqlah Shirazi. The straight angular forms of Kufic were replaced in the new script by curved and oblique lines. In Thuluth, one-third of each letter slopes, from which the name (meaning \"a third\" in Arabic) comes. An alternative theory to the meaning is that the smallest width of the letter is one third of the widest part. It is an elegant, cursive script, used in medieval times on mosque decorations. Various calligraphic styles evolved from Thuluth through slight changes of form.\n\nHistory\n\nThe greatest contributions to the evolution of the Thuluth script, occurred during Ottoman Empire in three successive steps that Ottoman Art Historians call \"calligraphical revolutions\":\n\n*The first revolution occurred in the 15th century and was initiated by the Master Calligrapher \u015eeyh Hamdullah.[http://www.kalemguzeli.net/huseyin-kutlu-hat-sanati-kalemi-sevk-edebilmektir.html H\u00fcseyin Kutlu: Hat sanat\u0131 kalemi \u015fevk edebilmektir - Kalem G\u00fczeli][http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00xcallig/mughalearly/zzturkey/hamdullah1500s.html hamdullah1500s]\n*The second revolution resulted from the work of the Ottoman calligrapher H\u00e2f\u0131z Osman in the 17th century.[http://www.istanbul.edu.tr/Bolumler/guzelsanat/kitap.htm Kitap Sanat\u0131] \n*Finally, in the late 19th century, Mehmed \u015eevk\u00ee Efendi gave the script the distinctive shape it has today.[http://sanattarihi.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/mehmed-sevki-efendi-2/ Mehmed \u015eevki Efendi \u00ab Sanat Tarihi] [http://www.turkislamsanatlari.com/sevkiefendi.asp T\u00fcrk \u00ddslam Sanatlar\u00fd - Tezyini Sanatlar]\n\nArtists\n\nThe best known artist to write the Thuluth script at its zenith is said to be Mustafa R\u00e2k\u0131m Efendi (1757\u20131826), a painter who set a standard in Ottoman calligraphy which many believe has not been surpassed to this day.[http://calligrapher.blogsome.com/2006/04/20/rakim-mustafa-rakim-1757-1826/ Journal of Ottoman Calligraphy :: RAKIM: \u201cMustafa Rakim\u201d (1757 - 1826) :: April :: 2006]\n\nUsage\n\nThuluth was used to write the headings of surahs, Qur'anic chapters. Some of the oldest copies of the Qur'an were written in Thuluth. Later copies were written in a combination of Thuluth and either Naskh or Muhaqqaq. After the 15th century Naskh came to be used exclusively.\n\nThe script is used in the Flag of Saudi Arabia where its text, Shahada al Tawhid, is written in Thuluth.\n\nStyle\n\nAn important aspect of Thuluth script is the use of harakat (\"hareke\" in Turkish) to represent vowel sounds and of certain other stylistic marks to beautify the script. The rules governing the former are similar to the rules for any Arabic script. The stylistic marks have their own rules regarding placement and grouping which allow for great creativity as to shape and orientation. For example, one grouping technique is to separate the marks written below letters from those written above.\n\nScripts developed from Thuluth\n\nSince its creation, Thuluth has given rise to a variety of scripts used in calligraphy and over time has allowed numerous modifications. Jeli Thuluth was developed for use in large panels, such as those on tombstones. Muhaqqaq script was developed by widening the horizontal sections of the letters in Thuluth. Naskh script introduced a number of modifications resulting in smaller size and greater delicacy. Tevki is a smaller version of Thuluth .\n\nRuq'ah was probably derived from the Thuluth and Naskh styles, the latter itself having originated from Thuluth.\nQuestion:\nThe script of Thuluth, a variety of Islamic calligraphy, is seen on the flag of what country?\nAnswer:\nSaudia Arabia\nPassage:\nAmazon - definition of Amazon by The Free Dictionary\nAmazon - definition of Amazon by The Free Dictionary\nAmazon - definition of Amazon by The Free Dictionary\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/Amazon\n\u00a0(\u0103m\u2032\u0259-z\u014fn\u2032, -z\u0259n)\nn.\n1.

This folk etymology, like most folk etymologies, is incorrect, but the Amazons of legend are not so completely different from the historical Amazons, who were also warriors. The historical Amazons were Scythians, an Iranian people renowned for their cavalry. The first Greeks to come into contact with the Iranians were the Ionians, who lived on the coast of Asia Minor and were constantly threatened by the Persians, the most important of the Iranian peoples. Amaz\u014dn is the Ionian Greek form of the Iranian word ha-mazan, \"fighting together.\" The regular Greek form would be hamaz\u014dn, but because the Ionians dropped their aitches like Cockneys, hamaz\u014dn became amaz\u014dn, the form taken into the other Greek dialects.\namazon\n(\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n)\nn\n(Animals) any of various tropical American parrots of the genus Amazona, such as A. farinosa (green amazon), having a short tail and mainly green plumage\nAmazon\n(\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n)\nn\n1.

People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day.\nIn a typical sleep cycle , we initially enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep . For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis -- which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can become apparent at any age. In many cases, narcolepsy is undiagnosed and, therefore, untreated.\nWhat Causes Narcolepsy?\nThe cause of narcolepsy is not known; however, scientists have made progress toward identifying genes strongly associated with the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in the brain that may signal sleep and awake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may be due to a deficiency in the production of a chemical called hypocretin by the brain . In addition, researchers have discovered abnormalities in various parts of the brain involved in regulating REM sleep . These abnormalities apparently contribute to symptom development. According to experts, it is likely narcolepsy involves multiple factors that interact to cause neurological dysfunction and REM sleep disturbances.\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Narcolepsy?\nSymptoms of narcolepsy include:\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS): In general, EDS interferes with normal activities on a daily basis, whether or not a person with narcolepsy has sufficient sleep at night. People with EDS report mental cloudiness, a lack of energy and concentration, memory lapses, a depressed mood, and/or extreme exhaustion.\nCataplexy: This symptom consists of a sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to feelings of weakness and a loss of voluntary muscle control. It can cause symptoms ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved, and is often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger.\nHallucinations : Usually, these delusional experiences are vivid and frequently frightening. The content is primarily visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations when accompanying sleep onset and hypnopompic hallucinations when they occur during awakening.\nSleep paralysis : This symptom involves the temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes are generally brief, lasting a few seconds to several minutes. After episodes end, people rapidly recover their full capacity to move and speak.\nContinued\nHow Is Narcolepsy Diagnosed?\nA physical exam and exhaustive medical history are essential for proper diagnosis of narcolepsy. However, none of the major symptoms is exclusive to narcolepsy. Several specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic or sleep lab, usually are required before a diagnosis can be established. Two tests that are considered essential in confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy are the polysomnogram (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).\nThe PSG is an overnight test that takes continuous multiple measurements while a patient is asleep to document abnormalities in the sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether REM sleep occurs at abnormal times in the sleep cycle and can eliminate the possibility that an individual's symptoms result from another condition.\nThe MSLT is performed during the day to measure a person's tendency to fall asleep and to determine whether isolated elements of REM sleep intrude at inappropriate times during the waking hours. As part of the test, an individual is asked to take four or five short naps usually scheduled two hours apart.\nHow Is Narcolepsy Treated?\nAlthough there is no cure for narcolepsy, the most disabling symptoms of the disorder (EDS and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep, such as cataplexy) can be controlled in most people with drug treatment. Sleepiness is treated with amphetamine -like stimulants, while the symptoms of abnormal REM sleep are treated with antidepressant drugs.\nThere has recently been a new medication approved for those who suffer from narcolepsy with cataplexy. This drug, called Xyrem , helps people with narcolepsy get a better night's sleep, allowing them to be less sleepy during the day. Patients with narcolepsy can be substantially helped -- but not cured -- by medical treatment.\nLifestyle adjustments such as avoiding caffeine , alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals, regulating sleep schedules, scheduling daytime naps (10-15 minutes in length), and establishing a normal exercise and meal schedule may also help to reduce symptoms.\nWebMD Medical Reference Reviewed by Varnada  Karriem-Norwood, MD on August 28, 2014\nSources\nQuestion:\nWhat is the medical condition in which a person has an extreme tendency to fall asleep at inappropriate times?\nAnswer:\nNarcelepsy\nPassage:\nLouis XIV - World history\nLouis XIV\nLouis XIV\n1638 - 1715\nFrench King\nLouis XIV was called the Grand Monarch or Sun King.  His 72-year reign was the longest in modern European history.\nLouis was the son of Louis XIII, whom he succeeded at the age of five. During his childhood France was ruled by his mother, and her chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin. In 1660 Louis married Maria Theresa, the daughter of Philip IV of Spain.\nIn 1661 he assumed sole responsibility for government. He initiated an aggressive foreign, particularly against the Dutch; but his major political rivals were the Austrian Habsburgs. From 1665 Louis tried to take  possession of the Spanish Netherlands, but later tried to acquire the whole Spanish inheritance, which led to the War of the Spanish Sucession .\nLouis XIV brought France to its peak of absolute power and his words  'L'etat c'est moi' ('I am the state') express the spirit of a rule in  which the king held all political authority. His absolutism brought him into conflict with the Huguenots and the papacy, with damaging repercussions.\nHis many foreign wars became a financial burden, yet his long reign is associated  with the greatest age of French culture, symbolized by the Palace of Versailles.\nwww link :\nQuestion:\nGive a year in the life of King Louis XIV, the Sun King.\nAnswer:\n1638-1715\nPassage:\nClarified butter\nClarified butter is milk fat rendered from butter to separate the milk solids and water from the butterfat.  Typically, it is produced by melting butter and allowing the components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float to the surface and are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat (which would then be on top) is poured off.\n\nCommercial methods of production also include direct evaporation, but may also be accomplished by decantation and centrifugation followed by vacuum drying; or direct from cream by breaking the emulsion followed by centrifugation.  \n\nProperties\n\nClarified butter has a higher smoke point (485 \u00b0F or 252\u00a0\u00b0C) than regular butter (325-375 \u00b0F or 163-190\u00a0\u00b0C),  and is therefore preferred in some cooking applications, such as saut\u00e9ing. Clarified butter also has a much longer shelf life than fresh butter. It has negligible amounts of lactose and casein and is, therefore, acceptable to most who have a lactose intolerance or milk allergy. \n\nRegional variations\n\nIn South Asian cuisine and Arab cuisine, clarified butter (ghee) may be cooked long enough to evaporate the water portion and caramelize the milk solids (which are then filtered out), resulting in a nutty flavor.\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the cooked and clarified butter, much used in Indian cuisine?\nAnswer:\nGHEE\nPassage:\nHablot Knight Browne\nHablot Knight Browne (10 July 1815 \u2013 8 July 1882) was an English artist.  Well-known by his pen name, Phiz, he illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth.\n\nBiography\n\nOf Huguenot ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne's fifteen children. According to Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens' world says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition and 15 June 1815 (Dictionary of National Biography). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \n\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned his family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to Philadelphia where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine. \nThomas Moxon, husband of William's sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\n\nBrowne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of John Gilpin, he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\n\nArtistic career\n\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  Pickwick. Browne had been the illustrator of his little pamphlet Sunday under Three Heads. In the original edition of Pickwick, issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by Robert Seymour,  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by Robert William Buss.\n\nBrowne and William Makepeace Thackeray visited the publishers' office with specimens of their work for Dickens's inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed \"Nemo,\" but the third was signed \"Phiz,\" a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from \"Nemo\" to \"Phiz\" was made to harmonize better with Dickens's \"Boz.\"\n\nPhiz developed the character Sam Weller graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator's work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\n\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Browne made several drawings for Punch in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to Punch's Pocket Books.\n\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne). He also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth's and Frank Smedley's novels. Mervyn Clitheroe by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist's works. Browne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the Royal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\n\nMost of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\n\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Phiz-Sarony- 1870s.jpg|Browne photographed by Sarony c.1870s\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque, Ladbroke Grove, London\nFile:Phiz Auriol.jpg|Scene from Auriol by Harrison Ainsworth, 1844\nFile:Pelham.jpg|Frontispiece to Pelham by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1849\nQuestion:\nWhat was the pen name of the illustrator Hablot Knight-Brown?\nAnswer:\nHablot Knight Browne\nPassage:\nMermaid Theatre\nThe Mermaid Theatre was a theatre encompassing the site of Puddle Dock and Curriers' Alley  at Blackfriars in the City of London, and the most recently built in the City since the time of Shakespeare. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.\n\nHistory\n\nThe 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor Bernard Miles with his wife, Josephine Wilson. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the St. John's Wood area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of Dido and Aeneas with Kirsten Flagstad, Maggie Teyte and Thomas Hemsley, conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the Royal Exchange. \n\nMiles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the Jacobean era, to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by Philip Rosseter with distant backing from Henslowe and Alleyn, was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.\n\nThe new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of Lock Up Your Daughters and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as Cowardy Custard (often cited as responsible for the revival of interest in No\u00ebl Coward's works) and including an annual staging of Treasure Island, with Miles reprising his role of Long John Silver, which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.\n\nIn July 1961 the poet and author Sylvia Plath read her poem \"Tulips\" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, Ted Hughes.\n\nOther notable productions include the 1978 premi\u00e8re of Whose Life Is It Anyway?, with Tom Conti and Rona Anderson. \n\nGomba Holdings, a property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family, which claimed to have interests in the Garrick and Duchess theatres as well as Wembley Stadium,  bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the Johnson Matthey bank collapse.    Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.\n\nMarc Sinden was appointed artistic director in 1993, opening the Bernard Miles Studio as a second performance area,  but left the next year.  Actor Roy Marsden and Vanessa Ford took over the running of the theatre for a few months prior to its eventual closure and the termination of the Shamji family's ownership.\n\nAfter a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, ordered the council to block the demolition. As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The BBC Concert Orchestra used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, Friday Night is Music Night that showcased musicians such as the violinist Nigel Kennedy and singer Josh Groban. In 2006, music duo Pet Shop Boys played a mid-length set accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled Concrete.\n\nLoss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans\n\nIn September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the Theatres Trust and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,  granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer \u00a36 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.  The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners are concerned that the entire building may be demolished.  John Levitt, former chairman of Save London\u2019s Theatres Campaign, which led the high profile battle to save the venue, branded the decision \u201ca tragedy\u201d and \u201csheer meanness\u201d.\nQuestion:\nAt which location in London is the Mermaid Theatre?\nAnswer:\nPuddle Dock\nPassage:\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in ...\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange\nEtymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames\n6\nThere is clearly a prefix in names like McDonald, McChrystal, O\u2019Brian, O\u2019Neal.\nWhat does this Mc- and O- prefix signify?

Built in Kunsan, South Korea in a factory equipped with sophisticated laser-guided robots, it was developed as a replacement for the Daewoo Nexia and styled in Italy by Italian I.DE.A Institute. Engineering was carried out and overseen by former Porsche engineer Ulrich Bez (later of Aston Martin) using experience Daewoo gained from manufacturing previous GM platforms. The name Nubira (\ub204\ube44\ub77c) is the command form of the Korean verb Nubida (\ub204\ube44\ub2e4), meaning to crisscross.  Thus the name was chosen to convey the aspiration that this car would be seen crisscrossing every corner of the globe.\n\nThe Nubira II (J150) was released for model year 2000. Over 90 improvements were made by Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in the United Kingdom, including an increase in passenger space and a decrease in noise, harshness and vibration (by adding a fourth engine mount and retuning the intake resonators for example). Offset crash performance was further improved in the second generation, as demonstrated by Australian ANCAP tests, though it fell well short of exemplary performance. The exterior was reworked, creating a more dynamic upright and swept look of the era, a design later seen reflected by the Lexus ES350 and 2004 Mitsubishi Diamante.\n\nIn the United States, the Nubira was marketed with Daewoo's smaller subcompact Lanos and midsize Leganza. Daewoo had a difficult time entering the US auto market due to financial trouble at home; with 2002 being the last model year available due to bankruptcy and a lack of new product. In North America, the cars are relatively obscure, if not rare, and sourcing parts for them became relatively difficult; though many powertrain parts were shared worldwide with other GM platforms (Opel, Holden, Isuzu). \n\nBuyers could opt for either the base SE models, (mid range SX only available for 1999) or the premium CDX with standard features such as ABS, heated mirrors, cruise control, in-dash CD player and optional leather seating and power sunroof.\n\nUnited States Nubira models came equipped only with an Australian built Holden produced DOHC 16-valve 2.0-liter inline-4 General Motors \"D-Tec\" gasoline engine paired with either a Daewoo-designed D-20 five-speed manual transaxle or optional GM sourced 4T40E auto. Producing 136 lbft torque at 4,400\u00a0rpm, the GM Family-II engine had a square 3.4\" stroke and a 3.4\" bore and at 5,400\u00a0rpm making 129 bhp. International market Nubiras had a choice of a Daewoo \"E-Tech\" 1.6, or Holden 1.8 or 2.0-litre inline-four gasoline engines: no diesel version was ever offered, although the Worthing Technical Centre installed Renault's F8 1.9-litre engine in a small number of test vehicles, under a development programme known as J151.\n\nThe Nubira was also briefly produced from CKD kits on Taganrog, Russia TagAZ factory; it was marketed as the Doninvest Orion by the Russian automaker Doninvest. Until 2008, Daewoo Nubira was produced in Romania in a former Daewoo factory which had the licence from GM Daewoo. The Daewoo Nubira was still produced in Egypt in 2008, in a former Daewoo factory which has the licence from GM Daewoo.\n\nThe Nubira was replaced in 2004 with the J200 Daewoo Lacetti Suzuki Forenza, under GMDAT management with a new Pininfarina-designed body offered as a sedan, station wagon, and Italdesign hatchback and sold in some European markets as the Chevrolet Nubira.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Daewoo Nubira 5door.jpg|Daewoo Nubira hatchback\nFile:1999 Daewoo Nubira (J100) SE sedan (2015-07-03) 02.jpg|1999 Daewoo Nubira sedan (Australia)\nFile:'00-'02 Daewoo Nubira Sedan.JPG|2000\u20132002 Daewoo Nubira sedan (Canada)\nFile:00-02 Daewoo Nubira wagon rear.jpg|2000\u20132002 Daewoo Nubira wagon (US)\nFile:Daweoo 2.0 L DOHC engine I4 engine.jpg|Daewoo Nubira 2.0 L engine (US)\nQuestion:\nWhich car company manufactured the Nubira\nAnswer:\nTaeu\nPassage:\nFiredamp\nFiredamp is flammable gas found in coal mines. It is the name given to a number of flammable gases, especially methane. It is particularly found in areas where the coal is bituminous. The gas accumulates in pockets in the coal and adjacent strata, and when they are penetrated, the release can trigger explosions. Historically, if such a pocket was highly pressurized, it was termed a \"bag of foulness\". \n\nName \n\nDamps is the collective name given to all gases (other than air) found in coal mines in England. The word corresponds to German Dampf, the  name for \"vapour\".  \n\nAlongside firedamp, other damps include blackdamp (carbon dioxide and other gases), poisonous, explosive stinkdamp (hydrogen sulphide), with its characteristic \"rotten egg\" odour, and the insidiously lethal afterdamp (carbon monoxide and other gases)  produced following explosions of firedamp or coal dust.\n\nContribution to mine deaths\n\nFiredamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most explosions occurring at around 10%. It caused much loss of life in coal mines before the invention of the Geordie lamp and Davy lamp. The invention was prompted by the Felling mine disaster near Newcastle upon Tyne claiming 92 lives on 25 May 1812. Davy experimented with iron gauze, determining the maximum size of the gaps and the optimum wire thickness to prevent a flame passing through the gauze. If a naked flame was thus enclosed totally by such a gauze, then methane could pass into the lamp and burn safely above the flame. He did not patent his invention.\n\nEven after the safety lamps were brought into common use, firedamp explosions could still occur from sparks produced when coal contaminated with pyrites was struck with metal tools. The presence of coal dust in the air increased the risk of explosion with firedamp, and indeed could cause explosions itself.\n\nThe Tyneside coal mines in England had the deadly combination of bituminous coal contaminated with pyrites, and a great number of lives were lost in accidents due to firedamp explosions, including 102 dead at Wallsend in 1835. A continuous flame was produced at Whitehaven some time before 1733, described as being \"a yard wide and two yards long.\" The miners dealt with it by piping it to the outside. \n\nRather than the Davy lamp, Tyneside miners used the Geordie lamp, a similar safety lamp designed by George Stephenson. After the widespread introduction of the safety lamp, explosions continued because the early Davy lamps were fragile and easily damaged. The iron gauze for example only needed to lose one wire to become unsafe. The light was also very poor, and there were continuous attempts to improve the basic design. The height of the cone of burning methane in a flame safety lamp can be used to estimate the concentration of the gas in the local atmosphere. It was not until the 1890s that safe and reliable electric lamps became available in collieries.\nQuestion:\nWhich gas was once known as ' Fire Damp ' because it often caused explosions in mines ?\nAnswer:\nETHANE\nPassage:\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional ...\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional Dogs \u2013 Better Reading\nContact\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional Dogs\nIt\u2019s National Dog Day in Australia this Wednesday, 26th August.

Showcasing most of the major French or Belgian comics talents of its day the magazine introduced major series such as Ast\u00e9rix, Barbe-Rouge, Blueberry, Achille Talon, and Val\u00e9rian et Laureline.  Major comics writers like Ren\u00e9 Goscinny, Jean-Michel Charlier, Greg, Pierre Christin and Jacques Lob were featured in the magazine, as were artists such as Jij\u00e9, Morris, Albert Uderzo, Jean (M\u0153bius) Giraud, Enki Bilal, Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, Jacques Tardi, Philippe Druillet, Marcel Gotlib, Alexis, and Annie Goetzinger.\n\nPilote also published several international talents such as Hugo Pratt, Frank Bellamy and Robert Crumb.\n\nHistory\n\nFollowing the publication of a teaser issue number 0 on June 1, Pilote made its debut proper on October 29, 1959.  The magazine was started by experienced comics writers Goscinny and Charlier, and artists Albert Uderzo and Jean H\u00e9brard. Previously this team had worked together on several other projects, creating Le Suppl\u00e9ment Illustr\u00e9, a cartoon supplement for newspapers, and providing cartoons for Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9, a magazine published by Radio-Luxembourg.  Pilote was marketed by Radio-Luxembourg, and featured editorials written by popular radio personalities of the day. The 300,000 copies of the first issue sold out in one day.\n\nCharlier and Goscinny handled most of the initial writing. Although Charlier came up with two popular series, Tanguy et Laverdure with Albert Uderzo and Barbe-Rouge (Redbeard) with Victor Hubinon, it was Goscinny and Uderzo\u2019s Ast\u00e9rix le Gaulois which was the biggest hit and the magazine\u2019s initial mainstay.\n\nDifficulties\n\nFinancial problems arose in 1960, but were resolved when the magazine was bought out by Dargaud publishers. Dargaud expanded the magazine with several new series, including Charlier and Giraud\u2019s Blueberry and Greg's Achille Tallon in 1963.  In 1967 the popular science-fiction series Val\u00e9rian et Laureline debuted and in 1968 the popular Western comedy Lucky Luke (by Morris) was transferred to Pilote from Spirou magazine. Other notable appearances included series from the British comics magazine Eagle such as Fraser l'Africain (Fraser of Africa) and Winston Churchill by Frank Bellamy.\n\nAttempts were made in the 1970s to update the magazine with material of more interest to adults, but many artists like Druillet and Giraud felt Pilote was no longer the appropriate vehicle for their aspirations and left to found new magazines such as M\u00e9tal Hurlant (the French original that inspired Heavy Metal).  Partly as a result, Dargaud reduced Pilote\u2019s publication schedule from weekly to monthly in 1974, and Ren\u00e9 Goscinny was replaced as editor-in-chief. At this time, a new generation of artists also started publishing in Pilote, namely Caza, Lauzier, and F'Murr. Their comics reflected the new, more adult direction.\n\nSales initially improved but a steady erosion took place through the 1980s as interest in the medium declined. Pilote was merged with the comics magazine Charlie Mensuel in 1986 and continued as Pilote et Charlie until 1988, when the name was changed back to Pilote.  However, declining sales prompted Dargaud to suspend publication after what became the final issue on October 1, 1989. \n\nAfter 1989, there has been no regular publications of the magazine, although the name has been used for occasional oversized specials. \n\nMain authors and series\n\n* Alexis: Timol\u00e9on et Stanislas (1969\u20131973), Al Crane (1976\u20131977)\n* Philippe Bertrand: Linda aime l'art (1983\u20131989)\n* Enki Bilal: L\u00e9gendes d'Aujourd'hui (1976\u20131982), La foire aux immortels (1980)\n* Michel Blanc-Dumont: Jonathan Cartland (1974\u20131988)\n* Claire Bret\u00e9cher: Cellulite (1969\u20131977)\n* Cabu: Grand Duduche (1963\u20131982)\n* Caza: Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de banlieue (1975\u20131979)\n* Jean Chakir: S\u00e9raphin contre Angelure (1962\u20131970)\n* Delinx: Buck Gallo (1963\u20131969)\n* Jean-Michel Charlier: Blueberry (1963\u20131973), Barbe-Rouge (1959\u20131969), Tanguy et Laverdure (1959\u20131970)\n* Pierre Christin: Val\u00e9rian and Laureline (1967\u20131985), L\u00e9gendes d'Aujourd'hui (1976\u20131982)\n* Philippe Druillet: Lone Sloane (1970\u20131974)\n* F'Murr: Le G\u00e9nie des alpages (1973\u20131989)\n* Fred: Phil\u00e9mon (1965\u20131986)\n* Jean Giraud: Blueberry (1963\u20131973)\n* Christian Godard: Norbert et Kari (1963\u20131970), Vagabond des limbes (1978\u20131987)\n* Ren\u00e9 Goscinny: Asterix (1959\u20131973), Lucky Luke (1967\u20131973), Iznogoud (1968\u20131977), Petit Nicolas (1959\u20131965)\n* Marcel Gotlib: Dingodossiers (1965\u20131967), Rubrique-\u00e0-Brac (1968\u20131973)\n* Greg: Achille Talon (1963\u20131981)\n* Laurence Harl\u00e9: Jonathan Cartland (1974\u20131988) \n* Victor Hubinon: Barbe-Rouge (1959\u20131969)\n* Jij\u00e9: Tanguy et Laverdure (1966\u20131970)\n* Claude Lacroix: Homme au chapeau mou (1977\u20131983)\n* Lauzier: Tranche de Vie (1970\u20131978), Al Crane (1976\u20131977)\n* Jacques Lob: Submerman (1967\u20131970)\n* Nikita Mandryka: Concombre masqu\u00e9 (1971\u20131981), Clopinettes (1970\u20131973)\n* Martial: Tony Laflamme (1963\u20131971)\n* Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res: Val\u00e9rian and Laureline (1967\u20131985)\n* Morris: Lucky Luke (1967\u20131973)\n* Antonio Hernandez Palacios: Mac Coy (1974\u20131989)\n* Julio Ribera: Vagabond des limbes (1978\u20131987), Dracurella (1973\u20131982)\n* Jean Tabary: Iznogoud (1968\u20131977), Valentin le vagabond (1962\u20131974)\n* Fran\u00e7ois Thomas: Stan Ca\u00efman (1982\u20131989)\n* Albert Uderzo: Asterix (1959\u20131973), Tanguy et Laverdure (1959\u20131967)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the generic title of a series of French comic strips that first appeared in French in the magazine Pilote on 29 October 1959?\nAnswer:\nThe Mirror World Asterix exhibition\n\n\nPassage:\nHigh Willhays\nHigh Willhays or, according to some authors, High Willes  is the highest point on Dartmoor, Devon, at 621\u00a0metres (2,039\u00a0ft) above sea level,Dartmoor National Park Authority, [http://web.archive.org/web/20070808234510/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/lab-geninfo.pdf General Information: Dartmoor Factsheet], 2004, p.\u00a01 and the highest point in the United Kingdom south of the Brecon Beacons.\n\nToponymy\n\nIn 1912, William Crossing, writer and documenter, said that the name High Willes had been thought to have derived from the word huel or wheal meaning mine, but he did not think that very likely as old mine workings were invariably located near to streams. He suggested instead that the name derived from gwylfa, a watching place, noting its similarity with Brown Willy, the name of the highest hill on nearby Bodmin Moor, and suggested that a watch for beacon fires used to be kept here.

However, the first topographical survey of the area carried out by Ordnance Survey suggested that High Willhays was twelve feet higher, although the difference has now been measured at just eight feet.

The straight angular forms of Kufic were replaced in the new script by curved and oblique lines. In Thuluth, one-third of each letter slopes, from which the name (meaning \"a third\" in Arabic) comes. An alternative theory to the meaning is that the smallest width of the letter is one third of the widest part. It is an elegant, cursive script, used in medieval times on mosque decorations. Various calligraphic styles evolved from Thuluth through slight changes of form.\n\nHistory\n\nThe greatest contributions to the evolution of the Thuluth script, occurred during Ottoman Empire in three successive steps that Ottoman Art Historians call \"calligraphical revolutions\":\n\n*The first revolution occurred in the 15th century and was initiated by the Master Calligrapher \u015eeyh Hamdullah.[http://www.kalemguzeli.net/huseyin-kutlu-hat-sanati-kalemi-sevk-edebilmektir.html H\u00fcseyin Kutlu: Hat sanat\u0131 kalemi \u015fevk edebilmektir - Kalem G\u00fczeli][http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00xcallig/mughalearly/zzturkey/hamdullah1500s.html hamdullah1500s]\n*The second revolution resulted from the work of the Ottoman calligrapher H\u00e2f\u0131z Osman in the 17th century.[http://www.istanbul.edu.tr/Bolumler/guzelsanat/kitap.htm Kitap Sanat\u0131] \n*Finally, in the late 19th century, Mehmed \u015eevk\u00ee Efendi gave the script the distinctive shape it has today.[http://sanattarihi.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/mehmed-sevki-efendi-2/ Mehmed \u015eevki Efendi \u00ab Sanat Tarihi] [http://www.turkislamsanatlari.com/sevkiefendi.asp T\u00fcrk \u00ddslam Sanatlar\u00fd - Tezyini Sanatlar]\n\nArtists\n\nThe best known artist to write the Thuluth script at its zenith is said to be Mustafa R\u00e2k\u0131m Efendi (1757\u20131826), a painter who set a standard in Ottoman calligraphy which many believe has not been surpassed to this day.[http://calligrapher.blogsome.com/2006/04/20/rakim-mustafa-rakim-1757-1826/ Journal of Ottoman Calligraphy :: RAKIM: \u201cMustafa Rakim\u201d (1757 - 1826) :: April :: 2006]\n\nUsage\n\nThuluth was used to write the headings of surahs, Qur'anic chapters. Some of the oldest copies of the Qur'an were written in Thuluth. Later copies were written in a combination of Thuluth and either Naskh or Muhaqqaq. After the 15th century Naskh came to be used exclusively.\n\nThe script is used in the Flag of Saudi Arabia where its text, Shahada al Tawhid, is written in Thuluth.\n\nStyle\n\nAn important aspect of Thuluth script is the use of harakat (\"hareke\" in Turkish) to represent vowel sounds and of certain other stylistic marks to beautify the script. The rules governing the former are similar to the rules for any Arabic script. The stylistic marks have their own rules regarding placement and grouping which allow for great creativity as to shape and orientation. For example, one grouping technique is to separate the marks written below letters from those written above.\n\nScripts developed from Thuluth\n\nSince its creation, Thuluth has given rise to a variety of scripts used in calligraphy and over time has allowed numerous modifications. Jeli Thuluth was developed for use in large panels, such as those on tombstones. Muhaqqaq script was developed by widening the horizontal sections of the letters in Thuluth.

Their name is supposedly derived from Greek a-mazos, \"without a breast,\" because according to the legend they cut off their right breasts so as to be better able to shoot with a bow and arrow. This folk etymology, like most folk etymologies, is incorrect, but the Amazons of legend are not so completely different from the historical Amazons, who were also warriors. The historical Amazons were Scythians, an Iranian people renowned for their cavalry. The first Greeks to come into contact with the Iranians were the Ionians, who lived on the coast of Asia Minor and were constantly threatened by the Persians, the most important of the Iranian peoples. Amaz\u014dn is the Ionian Greek form of the Iranian word ha-mazan, \"fighting together.\" The regular Greek form would be hamaz\u014dn, but because the Ionians dropped their aitches like Cockneys, hamaz\u014dn became amaz\u014dn, the form taken into the other Greek dialects.\namazon\n(\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n)\nn\n(Animals) any of various tropical American parrots of the genus Amazona, such as A. farinosa (green amazon), having a short tail and mainly green plumage\nAmazon\n(\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n)\nn\n1.

People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day.\nIn a typical sleep cycle , we initially enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep . For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis -- which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can become apparent at any age. In many cases, narcolepsy is undiagnosed and, therefore, untreated.\nWhat Causes Narcolepsy?\nThe cause of narcolepsy is not known; however, scientists have made progress toward identifying genes strongly associated with the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in the brain that may signal sleep and awake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may be due to a deficiency in the production of a chemical called hypocretin by the brain . In addition, researchers have discovered abnormalities in various parts of the brain involved in regulating REM sleep . These abnormalities apparently contribute to symptom development. According to experts, it is likely narcolepsy involves multiple factors that interact to cause neurological dysfunction and REM sleep disturbances.\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Narcolepsy?\nSymptoms of narcolepsy include:\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS): In general, EDS interferes with normal activities on a daily basis, whether or not a person with narcolepsy has sufficient sleep at night. People with EDS report mental cloudiness, a lack of energy and concentration, memory lapses, a depressed mood, and/or extreme exhaustion.\nCataplexy: This symptom consists of a sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to feelings of weakness and a loss of voluntary muscle control. It can cause symptoms ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved, and is often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger.\nHallucinations : Usually, these delusional experiences are vivid and frequently frightening. The content is primarily visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations when accompanying sleep onset and hypnopompic hallucinations when they occur during awakening.\nSleep paralysis : This symptom involves the temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes are generally brief, lasting a few seconds to several minutes. After episodes end, people rapidly recover their full capacity to move and speak.\nContinued\nHow Is Narcolepsy Diagnosed?\nA physical exam and exhaustive medical history are essential for proper diagnosis of narcolepsy. However, none of the major symptoms is exclusive to narcolepsy. Several specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic or sleep lab, usually are required before a diagnosis can be established. Two tests that are considered essential in confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy are the polysomnogram (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).\nThe PSG is an overnight test that takes continuous multiple measurements while a patient is asleep to document abnormalities in the sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether REM sleep occurs at abnormal times in the sleep cycle and can eliminate the possibility that an individual's symptoms result from another condition.\nThe MSLT is performed during the day to measure a person's tendency to fall asleep and to determine whether isolated elements of REM sleep intrude at inappropriate times during the waking hours. As part of the test, an individual is asked to take four or five short naps usually scheduled two hours apart.\nHow Is Narcolepsy Treated?\nAlthough there is no cure for narcolepsy, the most disabling symptoms of the disorder (EDS and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep, such as cataplexy) can be controlled in most people with drug treatment. Sleepiness is treated with amphetamine -like stimulants, while the symptoms of abnormal REM sleep are treated with antidepressant drugs.\nThere has recently been a new medication approved for those who suffer from narcolepsy with cataplexy. This drug, called Xyrem , helps people with narcolepsy get a better night's sleep, allowing them to be less sleepy during the day. Patients with narcolepsy can be substantially helped -- but not cured -- by medical treatment.\nLifestyle adjustments such as avoiding caffeine , alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals, regulating sleep schedules, scheduling daytime naps (10-15 minutes in length), and establishing a normal exercise and meal schedule may also help to reduce symptoms.\nWebMD Medical Reference Reviewed by Varnada  Karriem-Norwood, MD on August 28, 2014\nSources\nQuestion:\nWhat is the medical condition in which a person has an extreme tendency to fall asleep at inappropriate times?\nAnswer:\nNarcelepsy\nPassage:\nLouis XIV - World history\nLouis XIV\nLouis XIV\n1638 - 1715\nFrench King\nLouis XIV was called the Grand Monarch or Sun King.  His 72-year reign was the longest in modern European history.\nLouis was the son of Louis XIII, whom he succeeded at the age of five. During his childhood France was ruled by his mother, and her chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin. In 1660 Louis married Maria Theresa, the daughter of Philip IV of Spain.\nIn 1661 he assumed sole responsibility for government. He initiated an aggressive foreign, particularly against the Dutch; but his major political rivals were the Austrian Habsburgs. From 1665 Louis tried to take  possession of the Spanish Netherlands, but later tried to acquire the whole Spanish inheritance, which led to the War of the Spanish Sucession .\nLouis XIV brought France to its peak of absolute power and his words  'L'etat c'est moi' ('I am the state') express the spirit of a rule in  which the king held all political authority. His absolutism brought him into conflict with the Huguenots and the papacy, with damaging repercussions.\nHis many foreign wars became a financial burden, yet his long reign is associated  with the greatest age of French culture, symbolized by the Palace of Versailles.\nwww link :\nQuestion:\nGive a year in the life of King Louis XIV, the Sun King.\nAnswer:\n1638-1715\nPassage:\nClarified butter\nClarified butter is milk fat rendered from butter to separate the milk solids and water from the butterfat.  Typically, it is produced by melting butter and allowing the components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float to the surface and are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat (which would then be on top) is poured off.\n\nCommercial methods of production also include direct evaporation, but may also be accomplished by decantation and centrifugation followed by vacuum drying; or direct from cream by breaking the emulsion followed by centrifugation.  \n\nProperties\n\nClarified butter has a higher smoke point (485 \u00b0F or 252\u00a0\u00b0C) than regular butter (325-375 \u00b0F or 163-190\u00a0\u00b0C),  and is therefore preferred in some cooking applications, such as saut\u00e9ing. Clarified butter also has a much longer shelf life than fresh butter. It has negligible amounts of lactose and casein and is, therefore, acceptable to most who have a lactose intolerance or milk allergy. \n\nRegional variations\n\nIn South Asian cuisine and Arab cuisine, clarified butter (ghee) may be cooked long enough to evaporate the water portion and caramelize the milk solids (which are then filtered out), resulting in a nutty flavor.\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the cooked and clarified butter, much used in Indian cuisine?\nAnswer:\nGHEE\nPassage:\nHablot Knight Browne\nHablot Knight Browne (10 July 1815 \u2013 8 July 1882) was an English artist.  Well-known by his pen name, Phiz, he illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth.\n\nBiography\n\nOf Huguenot ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne's fifteen children. According to Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens' world says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition and 15 June 1815 (Dictionary of National Biography). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \n\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned his family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to Philadelphia where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine. \nThomas Moxon, husband of William's sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\n\nBrowne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of John Gilpin, he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\n\nArtistic career\n\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  Pickwick. Browne had been the illustrator of his little pamphlet Sunday under Three Heads. In the original edition of Pickwick, issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by Robert Seymour,  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by Robert William Buss.\n\nBrowne and William Makepeace Thackeray visited the publishers' office with specimens of their work for Dickens's inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed \"Nemo,\" but the third was signed \"Phiz,\" a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from \"Nemo\" to \"Phiz\" was made to harmonize better with Dickens's \"Boz.\"\n\nPhiz developed the character Sam Weller graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator's work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\n\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Browne made several drawings for Punch in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to Punch's Pocket Books.\n\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne). He also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth's and Frank Smedley's novels. Mervyn Clitheroe by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist's works. Browne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the Royal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\n\nMost of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\n\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Phiz-Sarony- 1870s.jpg|Browne photographed by Sarony c.1870s\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque, Ladbroke Grove, London\nFile:Phiz Auriol.jpg|Scene from Auriol by Harrison Ainsworth, 1844\nFile:Pelham.jpg|Frontispiece to Pelham by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1849\nQuestion:\nWhat was the pen name of the illustrator Hablot Knight-Brown?\nAnswer:\nHablot Knight Browne\nPassage:\nMermaid Theatre\nThe Mermaid Theatre was a theatre encompassing the site of Puddle Dock and Curriers' Alley  at Blackfriars in the City of London, and the most recently built in the City since the time of Shakespeare. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.\n\nHistory\n\nThe 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor Bernard Miles with his wife, Josephine Wilson. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the St. John's Wood area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of Dido and Aeneas with Kirsten Flagstad, Maggie Teyte and Thomas Hemsley, conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the Royal Exchange. \n\nMiles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the Jacobean era, to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by Philip Rosseter with distant backing from Henslowe and Alleyn, was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.\n\nThe new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of Lock Up Your Daughters and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as Cowardy Custard (often cited as responsible for the revival of interest in No\u00ebl Coward's works) and including an annual staging of Treasure Island, with Miles reprising his role of Long John Silver, which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.\n\nIn July 1961 the poet and author Sylvia Plath read her poem \"Tulips\" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, Ted Hughes.\n\nOther notable productions include the 1978 premi\u00e8re of Whose Life Is It Anyway?, with Tom Conti and Rona Anderson. \n\nGomba Holdings, a property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family, which claimed to have interests in the Garrick and Duchess theatres as well as Wembley Stadium,  bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the Johnson Matthey bank collapse.    Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.\n\nMarc Sinden was appointed artistic director in 1993, opening the Bernard Miles Studio as a second performance area,  but left the next year.  Actor Roy Marsden and Vanessa Ford took over the running of the theatre for a few months prior to its eventual closure and the termination of the Shamji family's ownership.\n\nAfter a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, ordered the council to block the demolition. As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The BBC Concert Orchestra used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, Friday Night is Music Night that showcased musicians such as the violinist Nigel Kennedy and singer Josh Groban. In 2006, music duo Pet Shop Boys played a mid-length set accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled Concrete.\n\nLoss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans\n\nIn September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the Theatres Trust and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,  granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer \u00a36 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.  The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners are concerned that the entire building may be demolished.  John Levitt, former chairman of Save London\u2019s Theatres Campaign, which led the high profile battle to save the venue, branded the decision \u201ca tragedy\u201d and \u201csheer meanness\u201d.\nQuestion:\nAt which location in London is the Mermaid Theatre?\nAnswer:\nPuddle Dock\nPassage:\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in ...\nprefixes - Etymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange\nEtymology for \u201cMc\u2011\u201d and \u201cO\u2019\u2011\u201d prefix in surnames\n6\nThere is clearly a prefix in names like McDonald, McChrystal, O\u2019Brian, O\u2019Neal.\nWhat does this Mc- and O- prefix signify?

Built in Kunsan, South Korea in a factory equipped with sophisticated laser-guided robots, it was developed as a replacement for the Daewoo Nexia and styled in Italy by Italian I.DE.A Institute. Engineering was carried out and overseen by former Porsche engineer Ulrich Bez (later of Aston Martin) using experience Daewoo gained from manufacturing previous GM platforms. The name Nubira (\ub204\ube44\ub77c) is the command form of the Korean verb Nubida (\ub204\ube44\ub2e4), meaning to crisscross.  Thus the name was chosen to convey the aspiration that this car would be seen crisscrossing every corner of the globe.\n\nThe Nubira II (J150) was released for model year 2000. Over 90 improvements were made by Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in the United Kingdom, including an increase in passenger space and a decrease in noise, harshness and vibration (by adding a fourth engine mount and retuning the intake resonators for example). Offset crash performance was further improved in the second generation, as demonstrated by Australian ANCAP tests, though it fell well short of exemplary performance. The exterior was reworked, creating a more dynamic upright and swept look of the era, a design later seen reflected by the Lexus ES350 and 2004 Mitsubishi Diamante.\n\nIn the United States, the Nubira was marketed with Daewoo's smaller subcompact Lanos and midsize Leganza. Daewoo had a difficult time entering the US auto market due to financial trouble at home; with 2002 being the last model year available due to bankruptcy and a lack of new product. In North America, the cars are relatively obscure, if not rare, and sourcing parts for them became relatively difficult; though many powertrain parts were shared worldwide with other GM platforms (Opel, Holden, Isuzu). \n\nBuyers could opt for either the base SE models, (mid range SX only available for 1999) or the premium CDX with standard features such as ABS, heated mirrors, cruise control, in-dash CD player and optional leather seating and power sunroof.\n\nUnited States Nubira models came equipped only with an Australian built Holden produced DOHC 16-valve 2.0-liter inline-4 General Motors \"D-Tec\" gasoline engine paired with either a Daewoo-designed D-20 five-speed manual transaxle or optional GM sourced 4T40E auto. Producing 136 lbft torque at 4,400\u00a0rpm, the GM Family-II engine had a square 3.4\" stroke and a 3.4\" bore and at 5,400\u00a0rpm making 129 bhp. International market Nubiras had a choice of a Daewoo \"E-Tech\" 1.6, or Holden 1.8 or 2.0-litre inline-four gasoline engines: no diesel version was ever offered, although the Worthing Technical Centre installed Renault's F8 1.9-litre engine in a small number of test vehicles, under a development programme known as J151.\n\nThe Nubira was also briefly produced from CKD kits on Taganrog, Russia TagAZ factory; it was marketed as the Doninvest Orion by the Russian automaker Doninvest. Until 2008, Daewoo Nubira was produced in Romania in a former Daewoo factory which had the licence from GM Daewoo. The Daewoo Nubira was still produced in Egypt in 2008, in a former Daewoo factory which has the licence from GM Daewoo.\n\nThe Nubira was replaced in 2004 with the J200 Daewoo Lacetti Suzuki Forenza, under GMDAT management with a new Pininfarina-designed body offered as a sedan, station wagon, and Italdesign hatchback and sold in some European markets as the Chevrolet Nubira.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Daewoo Nubira 5door.jpg|Daewoo Nubira hatchback\nFile:1999 Daewoo Nubira (J100) SE sedan (2015-07-03) 02.jpg|1999 Daewoo Nubira sedan (Australia)\nFile:'00-'02 Daewoo Nubira Sedan.JPG|2000\u20132002 Daewoo Nubira sedan (Canada)\nFile:00-02 Daewoo Nubira wagon rear.jpg|2000\u20132002 Daewoo Nubira wagon (US)\nFile:Daweoo 2.0 L DOHC engine I4 engine.jpg|Daewoo Nubira 2.0 L engine (US)\nQuestion:\nWhich car company manufactured the Nubira\nAnswer:\nTaeu\nPassage:\nFiredamp\nFiredamp is flammable gas found in coal mines.

Historically, if such a pocket was highly pressurized, it was termed a \"bag of foulness\". \n\nName \n\nDamps is the collective name given to all gases (other than air) found in coal mines in England. The word corresponds to German Dampf, the  name for \"vapour\".  \n\nAlongside firedamp, other damps include blackdamp (carbon dioxide and other gases), poisonous, explosive stinkdamp (hydrogen sulphide), with its characteristic \"rotten egg\" odour, and the insidiously lethal afterdamp (carbon monoxide and other gases)  produced following explosions of firedamp or coal dust.\n\nContribution to mine deaths\n\nFiredamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most explosions occurring at around 10%. It caused much loss of life in coal mines before the invention of the Geordie lamp and Davy lamp. The invention was prompted by the Felling mine disaster near Newcastle upon Tyne claiming 92 lives on 25 May 1812. Davy experimented with iron gauze, determining the maximum size of the gaps and the optimum wire thickness to prevent a flame passing through the gauze. If a naked flame was thus enclosed totally by such a gauze, then methane could pass into the lamp and burn safely above the flame. He did not patent his invention.\n\nEven after the safety lamps were brought into common use, firedamp explosions could still occur from sparks produced when coal contaminated with pyrites was struck with metal tools. The presence of coal dust in the air increased the risk of explosion with firedamp, and indeed could cause explosions itself.\n\nThe Tyneside coal mines in England had the deadly combination of bituminous coal contaminated with pyrites, and a great number of lives were lost in accidents due to firedamp explosions, including 102 dead at Wallsend in 1835. A continuous flame was produced at Whitehaven some time before 1733, described as being \"a yard wide and two yards long.\" The miners dealt with it by piping it to the outside. \n\nRather than the Davy lamp, Tyneside miners used the Geordie lamp, a similar safety lamp designed by George Stephenson. After the widespread introduction of the safety lamp, explosions continued because the early Davy lamps were fragile and easily damaged. The iron gauze for example only needed to lose one wire to become unsafe. The light was also very poor, and there were continuous attempts to improve the basic design. The height of the cone of burning methane in a flame safety lamp can be used to estimate the concentration of the gas in the local atmosphere. It was not until the 1890s that safe and reliable electric lamps became available in collieries.\nQuestion:\nWhich gas was once known as ' Fire Damp ' because it often caused explosions in mines ?\nAnswer:\nETHANE\nPassage:\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional ...\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional Dogs \u2013 Better Reading\nContact\nCelebrating National Dog Day with 13 Favourite Fictional Dogs\nIt\u2019s National Dog Day in Australia this Wednesday, 26th August.

Showcasing most of the major French or Belgian comics talents of its day the magazine introduced major series such as Ast\u00e9rix, Barbe-Rouge, Blueberry, Achille Talon, and Val\u00e9rian et Laureline.  Major comics writers like Ren\u00e9 Goscinny, Jean-Michel Charlier, Greg, Pierre Christin and Jacques Lob were featured in the magazine, as were artists such as Jij\u00e9, Morris, Albert Uderzo, Jean (M\u0153bius) Giraud, Enki Bilal, Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, Jacques Tardi, Philippe Druillet, Marcel Gotlib, Alexis, and Annie Goetzinger.\n\nPilote also published several international talents such as Hugo Pratt, Frank Bellamy and Robert Crumb.\n\nHistory\n\nFollowing the publication of a teaser issue number 0 on June 1, Pilote made its debut proper on October 29, 1959.  The magazine was started by experienced comics writers Goscinny and Charlier, and artists Albert Uderzo and Jean H\u00e9brard. Previously this team had worked together on several other projects, creating Le Suppl\u00e9ment Illustr\u00e9, a cartoon supplement for newspapers, and providing cartoons for Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9, a magazine published by Radio-Luxembourg.  Pilote was marketed by Radio-Luxembourg, and featured editorials written by popular radio personalities of the day. The 300,000 copies of the first issue sold out in one day.\n\nCharlier and Goscinny handled most of the initial writing. Although Charlier came up with two popular series, Tanguy et Laverdure with Albert Uderzo and Barbe-Rouge (Redbeard) with Victor Hubinon, it was Goscinny and Uderzo\u2019s Ast\u00e9rix le Gaulois which was the biggest hit and the magazine\u2019s initial mainstay.\n\nDifficulties\n\nFinancial problems arose in 1960, but were resolved when the magazine was bought out by Dargaud publishers. Dargaud expanded the magazine with several new series, including Charlier and Giraud\u2019s Blueberry and Greg's Achille Tallon in 1963.  In 1967 the popular science-fiction series Val\u00e9rian et Laureline debuted and in 1968 the popular Western comedy Lucky Luke (by Morris) was transferred to Pilote from Spirou magazine. Other notable appearances included series from the British comics magazine Eagle such as Fraser l'Africain (Fraser of Africa) and Winston Churchill by Frank Bellamy.\n\nAttempts were made in the 1970s to update the magazine with material of more interest to adults, but many artists like Druillet and Giraud felt Pilote was no longer the appropriate vehicle for their aspirations and left to found new magazines such as M\u00e9tal Hurlant (the French original that inspired Heavy Metal).  Partly as a result, Dargaud reduced Pilote\u2019s publication schedule from weekly to monthly in 1974, and Ren\u00e9 Goscinny was replaced as editor-in-chief. At this time, a new generation of artists also started publishing in Pilote, namely Caza, Lauzier, and F'Murr. Their comics reflected the new, more adult direction.\n\nSales initially improved but a steady erosion took place through the 1980s as interest in the medium declined. Pilote was merged with the comics magazine Charlie Mensuel in 1986 and continued as Pilote et Charlie until 1988, when the name was changed back to Pilote.  However, declining sales prompted Dargaud to suspend publication after what became the final issue on October 1, 1989. \n\nAfter 1989, there has been no regular publications of the magazine, although the name has been used for occasional oversized specials. \n\nMain authors and series\n\n* Alexis: Timol\u00e9on et Stanislas (1969\u20131973), Al Crane (1976\u20131977)\n* Philippe Bertrand: Linda aime l'art (1983\u20131989)\n* Enki Bilal: L\u00e9gendes d'Aujourd'hui (1976\u20131982), La foire aux immortels (1980)\n* Michel Blanc-Dumont: Jonathan Cartland (1974\u20131988)\n* Claire Bret\u00e9cher: Cellulite (1969\u20131977)\n* Cabu: Grand Duduche (1963\u20131982)\n* Caza: Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de banlieue (1975\u20131979)\n* Jean Chakir: S\u00e9raphin contre Angelure (1962\u20131970)\n* Delinx: Buck Gallo (1963\u20131969)\n* Jean-Michel Charlier: Blueberry (1963\u20131973), Barbe-Rouge (1959\u20131969), Tanguy et Laverdure (1959\u20131970)\n* Pierre Christin: Val\u00e9rian and Laureline (1967\u20131985), L\u00e9gendes d'Aujourd'hui (1976\u20131982)\n* Philippe Druillet: Lone Sloane (1970\u20131974)\n* F'Murr: Le G\u00e9nie des alpages (1973\u20131989)\n* Fred: Phil\u00e9mon (1965\u20131986)\n* Jean Giraud: Blueberry (1963\u20131973)\n* Christian Godard: Norbert et Kari (1963\u20131970), Vagabond des limbes (1978\u20131987)\n* Ren\u00e9 Goscinny: Asterix (1959\u20131973), Lucky Luke (1967\u20131973), Iznogoud (1968\u20131977), Petit Nicolas (1959\u20131965)\n* Marcel Gotlib: Dingodossiers (1965\u20131967), Rubrique-\u00e0-Brac (1968\u20131973)\n* Greg: Achille Talon (1963\u20131981)\n* Laurence Harl\u00e9: Jonathan Cartland (1974\u20131988) \n* Victor Hubinon: Barbe-Rouge (1959\u20131969)\n* Jij\u00e9: Tanguy et Laverdure (1966\u20131970)\n* Claude Lacroix: Homme au chapeau mou (1977\u20131983)\n* Lauzier: Tranche de Vie (1970\u20131978), Al Crane (1976\u20131977)\n* Jacques Lob: Submerman (1967\u20131970)\n* Nikita Mandryka: Concombre masqu\u00e9 (1971\u20131981), Clopinettes (1970\u20131973)\n* Martial: Tony Laflamme (1963\u20131971)\n* Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res: Val\u00e9rian and Laureline (1967\u20131985)\n* Morris: Lucky Luke (1967\u20131973)\n* Antonio Hernandez Palacios: Mac Coy (1974\u20131989)\n* Julio Ribera: Vagabond des limbes (1978\u20131987), Dracurella (1973\u20131982)\n* Jean Tabary: Iznogoud (1968\u20131977), Valentin le vagabond (1962\u20131974)\n* Fran\u00e7ois Thomas: Stan Ca\u00efman (1982\u20131989)\n* Albert Uderzo: Asterix (1959\u20131973), Tanguy et Laverdure (1959\u20131967)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the generic title of a series of French comic strips that first appeared in French in the magazine Pilote on 29 October 1959?\nAnswer:\nThe Mirror World Asterix exhibition\n", "answers": ["Dartmoor National Park", "DARTMOOR", "Dartmoor National park", "Dartmoor", "Okehayes Nursery", "Dartymoor"], "pred": " High Willhays is the highest point of what National Park?

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nErrol Brown\nLester Errol Brown MBE (12 November 1943 \u2013 6 May 2015) was a British-Jamaican singer and songwriter, best known as the frontman of the soul and funk band Hot Chocolate.  \n\nCareer\n\nBrown was born in Kingston, Jamaica, but moved to the UK when he was twelve years old. His break in music came in 1969 when he recorded a version of John Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance\" with a band called \"Hot Chocolate Band\". Unable to change the lyrics without Lennon's permission, he sent a copy to his record label, Apple, and the song was released with Lennon's approval. \n\nThe Hot Chocolate albums were produced by Mickie Most and recorded at the Rak Records studio. Brown left the group in 1985 to take a hiatus from music.   He soon went on to have a solo career, achieving success in the clubs with the 1987 single \"Body Rocking\", produced by Richard James Burgess. \n\nBrown was a supporter of the Conservative Party and performed at a party conference in the 1980s. In 1981, he performed at the wedding reception following the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, at Buckingham Palace. \n\nBrown owned National Hunt horses, including Gainsay. \n\nRecognition\n\nIn 2003, Queen Elizabeth II named Brown a Member of the Order of the British Empire for \"services to popular music for the United Kingdom\".   In 2004 he received an Ivor Novello Award for outstanding contributions to British music.\n\nDeath\n\nBrown died of liver cancer at his home in the Bahamas on 6 May 2015.

It is one of four Long Distance Routes in Scotland. It begins in Aviemore and ends at Buckpool harbour in Buckie, some 65 miles away. Some choose to walk the route from Buckie to Aviemore.  There is a spur leading off the main route to Tomintoul bringing the total distance up to 80 miles (130 km). In addition, there is a Dufftown loop option, and other less well-known routes (Badenoch Way, Dava Way, and Moray Coast Trail) can be worked in, all affecting the total distance walked.  Sections of the route are open to cycling.\n\nThe Way is clearly marked with a symbol showing a thistle in a hexagon.  The route generally follows the valley of the River Spey, passing some of the distilleries that produce Speyside single malts. The final five miles from Spey Bay to Buckie follow the coastline.\n\nAn extension of the route from Aviemore to Newtonmore is currently being progressed. This extension would lengthen the total route by , roughly following the route of the River Spey and utilising part of the Sustrans cycle route. The first part of the extension, to Kincraig, was opened in 2015.\n\nA formal proposal has now been submitted and has received approval in principle from Scottish Ministers, but it still looks likely that not all landowners will be in agreement with the designated route. If instructed by the Scottish Ministers, the Cairngorms National Park Authority can implement the route against landowners' wishes under the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 and the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Negotiations are still underway to attempt to avoid this situation.\n\nThe path follows most of the route of the former Strathspey Railway.\nQuestion:\nThe 81 mile Speyside Way runs from Buckie to which town and resort in the Cairngorms?\nAnswer:\nAviemore\nPassage:\nAare\nThe Aare or Aar is a tributary of the High Rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within Switzerland.\n\nIts total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about 295 km (183 miles), during which distance it descends 1565 m, draining an area of 17779 km2, almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of Central Switzerland.  \nThere are more than 40 hydroelectric plants along the course of the Aare River.\n\nThe river's name dates to at least the La T\u00e8ne period, and it is attested as Nantaror \"Aare valley\" in the Berne zinc tablet which dates back to Roman Gaul. \nThe name was Latinized as Arula/Arola/Araris. \n\nCourse\n\nThe Aare rises in the great Aargletschers (Aare Glaciers) of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass. The Finsteraargletscher and Lauteraargletscher come together to form the Unteraargletscher (Lower Aare-Glacier), which is the main source of water for the Grimselsee. The Oberaargletscher (Upper Aare-Glacier) feeds the Oberaarsee, which also flows into the Grimselsee. The Aare river leaves the Grimselsee just to the east to the Grimsel Hospice, below the Grimsel Pass, and then flows northwest through the Haslital, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, 46 m, past Guttannen.\n\nBetween Innertkirchen and Meiringen, the river carves through a limestone ridge in the Aare Gorge or Aareschlucht. It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge. A little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake Brienz. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important tributary, the L\u00fctschine. It then runs across the swampy plain of the B\u00f6deli between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun.\n\nNear the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the Kander, which has just been joined by the Simme. Lake Thun marks the head of navigation. On flowing out of the lake it passes through Thun, and then flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the Saane or Sarine it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne. From the upper end of the lake, at Nidau, the river issues through the Nidau-B\u00fcren channel, also called the Aare Canal, and then runs east to B\u00fcren. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the \"vegetable garden of Switzerland\".\n\nFrom here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town Solothurn (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau, near which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg, where the B\u00fcnz falls in on the right. A short distance further, below Brugg it receives first the Reuss, and shortly afterwards the Limmat. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the Rhine, which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut, Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands.\n\nTributaries \n\n* Limmat\n** Reppisch\n** Sihl\n*** Alp\n*** Minster\n** Linth (main tributary of Lake Z\u00fcrich)\n*** Seez (main tributary of Lake Walen)\n*** L\u00f6ntsch\n*** Sernf\n* Reuss (see also: Reuss (river)#Tributaries)\n** Kleine Emme\n** Sarner Aa\n** Engelberger Aa\n** Sch\u00e4chen\n** Furkareuss\n* Suhre\n* B\u00fcnz\n**Aabach\n* Wigger\n* Murg (Murgenthal)\n**Rot (Roggwil)\n**Langete (Langenthal)\n***Ursenbach (Kleindietwil)\n***Rotbach (Huttwil)\n* Emme  \n* Zihlkanal\n** Suze\n** Broye\n** Orbe\n* Saane (Sarine)\n** Sense\n* Kander\n** Simme\n** Allenbach\n* L\u00fctschine (Lake Brienz)\n\nReservoirs\n\n* Lake Grimsel, 1908 m\n* Lake Brienz, 564 m\n* Lake Thun, 558 m\n* Lake Wohlen, 481 m\n* Niederriedsee, 461 m\n* Lake Biel, 429 m\n* Klingnauer Stausee, 318 m\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\nQuestion:\nWhich European city lies on the river Aare?\nAnswer:\nBerne BE\nPassage:\nDigitalis purpurea\nDigitalis purpurea (foxglove, common foxglove, purple foxglove or lady's glove) is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae, native and widespread throughout most of temperate Europe. It is also naturalised in parts of North America and some other temperate regions. The plants are well known as the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin).\n\nDescription\n\nDigitalis purpurea is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple,  long and  broad, and are covered with gray-white pubescent and glandular hairs, imparting a woolly texture. The foliage forms a tight rosette at ground level in the first year.\n\nThe flowering stem develops in the second year, typically  tall, sometimes longer. The flowers are arranged in a showy, terminal, elongated cluster, and each flower is tubular and pendent. The flowers are typically purple, but some plants, especially those under cultivation, may be pink, rose, yellow, or white. The inside surface of the flower tube is heavily spotted. The flowering period is early summer, sometimes with additional flower stems developing later in the season. The plant is frequented by bees, which climb right inside the flower tube to gain the nectar within.\n\nThe fruit is a capsule which splits open at maturity to release the numerous tiny 0.1-0.2\u00a0mm seeds.\n\nSubspecies\n\nThe three subspecies of Digitalis purpurea are:\n*D. p. subsp. purpurea \u2013 most of Europe\n*D. p. subsp. heywoodii \u2013 Iberia\n*D. p. subsp. mariana \u2013 Iberia\n\nHybrids\n\n* Digitalis x fulva, Lindl. 1821 (hybrid formula: Digitalis grandiflora Mill. \u00d7 Digitalis purpurea L.).\n\nToxicity \n\nDue to the presence of the cardiac glycoside digitoxin, the leaves, flowers and seeds of this plant are all poisonous to humans and some animals and can be fatal if ingested.\n\nExtracted from the leaves, this same compound, whose clinical use was pioneered as digitalis by William Withering, is used as a medication for heart failure. He recognized it \"reduced dropsy\", increased urine flow and had a powerful effect on the heart. Unlike the purified pharmacological forms, extracts of this plant did not frequently cause intoxication because they induced nausea and vomiting within minutes of ingestion, preventing the patient from consuming more.\n\nThe main toxins in Digitalis spp. are the two chemically similar cardiac glycosides: digitoxin and digoxin. Like other cardiac glycosides, these toxins exert their effects by inhibiting the ATPase activity of a complex of transmembrane proteins that form the sodium potassium ATPase pump, (Na+/K+-ATPase). Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in turn causes a rise not only in intracellular Na+, but also in calcium, which in turn results in increased force of myocardial muscle contractions. In other words, at precisely the right dosage, Digitalis toxin can cause the heart to beat more strongly. However, digitoxin, digoxin and several other cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, are known to have steep dose-response curves, i.e., minute increases in the dosage of these drugs can make the difference between an ineffective dose and a fatal one.\n\nSymptoms of Digitalis poisoning include a low pulse rate, nausea, vomiting, and uncoordinated contractions of different parts of the heart, leading to cardiac arrest and finally death.\n\nCultivation \n\nThe plant is popular as a garden subject, and numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of colours from white through pink to purple, such as \"Dalmatian Purple\". Cultivated forms often show flowers completely surrounding the central spike, in contrast to the wild form, where the flowers only appear on one side.  D. purpurea is easily grown from seed or purchased as potted plants in the spring. The following selections have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n*'The Shirley' \n*'Excelsior group' \n*D. purpurea f. alba \n\nDigitalis purpurea is hardy to zones 4-9. \n\nUses\n\nDigoxigenin (DIG) is a steroid found exclusively in the flowers and leaves of the plants Digitalis purpurea and Digitalis lanata. It is used as a molecular probe to detect DNA or RNA. It can easily be attached to nucleotides by chemical modifications. DIG molecules are often linked to uridine nucleotides; DIG-labeled uridine (DIG-U) can then be incorporated into RNA probes via in vitro transcription. Once hybridisation occurs in situ, RNA probes with the incorporated DIG-U can be detected with anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. To reveal the hybridised transcripts, alkaline phosphatase can be reacted with a chromogen to produce a coloured precipitate.\n\nGenetics\n\nThe colours of the petals of the Digitalis purpurea are known to be determined by at least three genes that interact with each other. \n\nThe M gene determined the production of a purple pigment, a type of antocianin. The m gene does not produce this pigment. The D gene is an enhances of the M gene, and leads it to produce a big amount of the pigment. The d gene does not enhance the M gene, and only a small amount of pigment is produced. Lastly, the W gene makes the pigment be deposited only in some spots, while the w gene allows the pigment to be spread all over the flower.\n\nThis combination leads to four phenotypes:\n\n*M/_; W/_; _/_ = a white flower with purple spots;\n*m/m; _/_; _/_ = an albino flower with yellow spots;\n*M/_; w/w; d/d = a light purple flower;\n*M/_; w/w; D/_ = a dark purple flower.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThis plant inspired a famous poem by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli titled \"Digitale Purpurea\". It also inspired the Italian industrial metal band Digitalis Purpurea.\n\nThis plant features in the 2015 video game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It is one of several harvestable plants within the game, and is used for the production of tranquilizer rounds by the Mother Base R&D team\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Digitalis Purpurea.jpg\nImage:Digitalis_purpurea_alba_01-Juni.jpg|f.albiflora\nImage:Fingerborgsblomma, closeup.jpg|Close-up of flower\nImage:Digitalis_purpurea_-_K\u00f6hler\u2013s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-053.jpg|19th century illustration\nImage:Digitalis purpurea 'Primrose Carousel' Flower Closeup 1200px.jpg|Flower close-up\nImage:Digitalis purpurea 'Primrose Carousel' Leaves 1100px.jpg|Leaves\nFile: Digitalis seed 2.JPG|Young plant a few weeks old\nFile:Digitalis_purpurea_004.JPG|Giant flower demonstrating pseudo-peloria\nQuestion:\nWhat is the alternative name for the flower digitalis purpurea?\nAnswer:\nC36H56O14\nPassage:\nA Rake's Progress\nA Rake's Progress is a series of eight paintings by 18th-century English artist William Hogarth. The canvases were produced in 1732\u201333, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. \n\nPaintings\n\nAdaptations\n\nGavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled \"The Rake's Progress\" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.\nQuestion:\nWho painted The Rake's Progress?\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nNine Elms\nNine Elms is a district of London, situated in the far north-eastern corner of the London Borough of Wandsworth between Battersea and Vauxhall in the neighbouring borough of Lambeth.\n\nThe area was formerly mainly industrial but is now becoming more residential and commercial in character. It is dominated by Battersea Power Station, various railway lines and New Covent Garden Market. Also in the area is the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.\n\nNine Elms has residential developments along the riverside, like Chelsea Bridge Wharf or Embassy Gardens, and also three large council estates\u2014Carey Gardens, the Patmore and the Savona.\n\nHistory\n\nNine Elms Lane was named around 1645, from a row of elm trees bordering the road. In 1838, at the time of construction of the London and Southampton Railway, the area was described as \"a low swampy district occasionally overflowed by the Thames [whose] osier beds, pollards and windmille and the river give it a Dutch effect\".\n\nNine Elms railway station opened on 21 May 1838 as the first London terminus of the London and South Western Railway, which that day changed its name from the London and Southampton Railway. The neo-classical building was designed by Sir William Tite. The station was connected to points between Vauxhall and London Bridge by Thames steam boats. It closed in 1848 when the railway was extended to a new terminus at Waterloo station (then called Waterloo Bridge Station). The redundant station and the adjacent area, to the north of the new mainline, became the London and South Western Railway's carriage and wagon works and main locomotive works until their relocation to Eastleigh in 1909.  The company's largest locomotive depot was located on the south side of the main line. The buildings were damaged by bombs in World War II, and closed in 1967. They were demolished in 1968 and replaced by the flower section of the New Covent Garden Market. \n\nGasworks were established in 1853, close to the existing waterworks of the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company. Later Battersea Power Station was built on the site.\n\nVauxhall Motors was formed in 1857 by Scottish engineer Alexander Wilson at Nine Elms, originally as Alex Wilson and Company, before moving to Luton in 1907. There is a plaque commemorating the site of the original factory at the Sainsbury's Nine Elms petrol station on Wandsworth Road.\n\nFuture\n\nIn October 2008 the U.S. Embassy in London announced that it would relocate to the area, moving from its current location in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair;  the new embassy is slated for completion in 2017.  The Embassy of the Netherlands in London also announced in April 2013 that it was relocating to the area from its current location in Hyde Park Gate, Kensington.  The Chinese Embassy is also rumoured to be relocating to the area. \n\nOn 16 February 2012, Wandsworth Council approved Ballymore Group's plans for the 15 acre development. Embassy Gardens is set to provide \"up to 1,982 new homes alongside shops, cafes, bars, restaurants, business space, a 100 bed hotel, a health centre, children's playgrounds and sports pitches\".Wandsworth Council: [http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/news/article/11030/embassy_gardens_plans_approved Embassy Gardens plans approved | Wandsworth Council], accessdate: 9 September 2014 In 2014, it was reported that Ballymore had engaged Lazard and CBRE Group to raise about \u20ac2.5bn to fund the Embassy Gardens development.Independent.ie: [http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/nick-webb-mulryan-is-close-to-wiping-slate-clean-30301129.html Nick Webb: Mulryan is close to wiping slate clean - Independent.ie], accessdate: 1 September 2014\n\nWork commenced in 2013 on regeneration of the area around Battersea Power Station, including shops, cafes, restaurants, art and leisure facilities, office space and residential buildings. An essential part of the work is an extension of the London Underground to service the area. The proposed extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea - creating two new stations.  The station structure itself is expected to be repaired and secure by 2016, with completion of the whole project by 2020.\n\nPart of these plans is the creation of the linear park \u2013 a car-free area extending from Battersea Power Station to Vauxhall Cross. The park will open out onto other public areas such as shops, hotels and other parks and public squares alongside homes and residential areas.The linear park will open up onto the Thames River Path at numerous points along the path, allowing access to the river\u2019s edge and the beautiful views so rare in urban areas. \n\nIn 2015, Wandsworth council chose a design by Bystrup for a \u00a340m pedestrian bridge between Nine Elms and Pimlico.\nQuestion:\nWhat moved to Nine Elms in 1974?\nAnswer:\nPubs in Covent Garden\nPassage:\nTim Gudgin\nTim Gudgin (born 26 November 1929) is a retired British radio presenter and voiceover artist. He was best known for announcing the football results on the BBC sports programmes Grandstand and Final Score between 1995 and 2011. He read the results out for the last time on 19 November 2011, just a week before his 82nd birthday. \n\nEducation and early career\n\nHe was educated at the independent Whitgift School in South Croydon, London, but did not go to university. He carried out his National Service during the 1940s, and he started his broadcasting career during that time in Germany in 1949. After completing his National Service he started a long career at the BBC.\n\nGrandstand and Final Score\n\nHe began working on Grandstand in the 1960s, initially announcing the rugby and racing results, but then succeeded Len Martin as the broadcaster of the football results after Martin's death in 1995. Gudgin was only the second person to perform the role regularly from the inception of Grandstand in 1958. After Grandstand ended in 2007, he continued to read the results on Final Score.\n\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker described Gudgin as \"one of the most familiar voices in sport\" and \"a quintessential part of Saturday afternoons in this country\".   \n\nOther work\n\nHis voice has been heard on the BBC Radio 4 quiz Quote... Unquote, Housewives' Choice, Top of the Form and Friday Night is Music Night, amongst others. Interviewed in November 2011 Gudgin said, \"I did an in-vision commercial for Square Deal Surf which bought me the first house I ever had without a mortgage, so that was well worth it.\" \n\nPersonal life\n\nGudgin is a Crystal Palace supporter and lives in Emsworth, Hampshire. He is also said to be a fan of The Fall and once persuaded Mark E. Smith to read the football scores.[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/03/01/fighting_sailors_filthy_dunkin.html Guardian Unlimited: Sport blog: Fighting sailors, filthy dunks and the genius of Jean-Pierre Papin]\n\nRetirement\n\nHe announced just prior to reading the results on the 6 August 2011 that the 2011-2012 season would be his last before retirement, with his last reading on 19 November 2011.  He later cited several reasons for his retirement including his age, the distance he would have to travel following the BBC's relocation to Salford and his granddaughter's wedding in Australia which he wanted to be there for.\n\nHis successor on Final Score is Mike West, who was the presenter of sports bulletins on BBC Radio Lancashire.\nQuestion:\nWhich BBC Radio Lancashire presenter succeeded Tim Gudgin as reader of the sports results on Grandstand and Final Score?\nAnswer:\nMichael West\nPassage:\nMost prolific mother ever | Guinness World Records\nMost prolific mother ever | Guinness World Records\nMost prolific mother ever\nWhere\nRussia Shuya\nThe greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is 69, to the wife of Feodor Vassilyev (b. 1707\u2013c.1782), a peasant from Shuya, Russia. In 27 confinements she gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets.\n***\nNumerous contemporaneous sources exist, which suggest that this seemingly improbably and statistically unlikely story is true.\nThe case was reported to Moscow by the Monastery of Nikolsk on 27 Feb 1782, which had recorded every birth. It is noted that, by this time, only two of the children who were born in the period c. 1725\u201365 failed to survive their infancy.\nThe Gentleman's Magazine (1783, 53, 753) recounts: \"In an original letter now before me, dated St Petersburg, Aug 13, 1782, O. S. Feodor Wassilief [sic], aged 75, a peasant, said to be now alive and in perfect health, in the Government of Moscow, has had\u2013\nBy his first wife:\n---------\n8 births 18 children\nIn all, 35 births, 87 children, of which 84 are living and only three buried. . . The above relation, however astonishing, may be depended upon, as it came directly from an English merchant at St Petersburg to his relatives in England, who added that the peasant was to be introduced to the Empress.\"\nIn Saint Petersburg Panorama, Bashutski, 1834, the author notes that:\n\"In the day of 27 February 1782, the list from Nikolskiy monastery came to Moscow containing the information that a peasant of the Shuya  district, Feodor Vassilyev, married twice, had 87 children. His first wife in 27 confinements gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets. His second wife in eight confinements gave birth to six pairs of twins and two sets of triplets. F. Vassilyev was 75 at that time with 82 of his children alive.\"\nAnd the Lancet (1878) refers to a twin study carried out by the French Academy and:\n\"Apropos of the enquiry, the Committee of the Academy recall an account of a quite extraordinary fecundity that was published by M. Hermann in his \"Travaux Statistiques de la Russie,\" for Fedor Vassilet [sic]. . . who, in 1782, was aged 75 years, had had, by two wives, 87 children.\"\nAside from this, not much is known about the first Mrs Vassilyev - even her first name (although some sources claim her name was Valentina).\nIt is thought she lived to the age of 76.\nAlthough this historic record should be taken with a pinch of salt, it is certainly conceivable that Mrs Vassilyev could have had a genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate (release multiple eggs in one cycle), which significantly increases the chance of having twins or multiple children.\nIt is also not impossible for a woman to have 27 pregnancies during her fertile years.\nAll records listed on our website are current and up-to-date.

Additionally, due to radioactive decay, the ore also contains oxides of lead and trace amounts of helium. It may also contain thorium, and rare earth elements.\n\nIt used to be known as pitchblende (from pitch, because of its black color, and blende, a term used by German miners to denote minerals whose density suggested metal content, but whose exploitation, at the time they were named, was either unknown, impossible or not economically feasible). The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the Ore Mountains, on the German/Czech border. The type locality is the historic mining and spa town known as Joachimsthal, the modern day J\u00e1chymov, on the Czech side of the mountains, where F.E. Br\u00fcckmann described the mineral in 1772. Pitchblende from the Johanngeorgenstadt deposit in Germany was used by M. Klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium. \n\nAll uraninite minerals contain a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Marie Curie used pitchblende, processing tons of it herself, as the source material for her isolation of radium in 1898.\n\nUraninite also always contains small amounts of the lead isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb, the end products of the decay series of the uranium isotopes 238U and 235U respectively. Small amounts of helium are also present in uraninite as a result of alpha decay. Helium was first found on Earth in uraninite after having been discovered spectroscopically in the Sun's atmosphere. The extremely rare elements technetium and promethium can be found in uraninite in very small quantities (about 200\u00a0pg/kg and 4\u00a0fg/kg respectively), produced by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238.\n\nOccurrence\n\nUraninite is a major ore of uranium. Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the initial source for the Manhattan Project) and in the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, Canada.  Another important source of pitchblende is at Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with silver. It also occurs in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany, England, Rwanda and South Africa. In the United States it can be found in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina and Wyoming. The geologist Charles Steen made a fortune on the production of Uraninite in his Mi Vida mine in Moab, Utah.\n\nUranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into yellowcake, which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.\nQuestion:\nPitchblende is the chief ore of which metallic element?\nAnswer:\n234U\nPassage:\nFinnegan's Wake\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is a ballad that arose in the 1850s in the music-hall tradition of comical Irish songs. The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born \"with a love for the liquor\", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection\u2014whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha, meaning \"water of life\". \n\nUncommon or non-standard English phrases and terms\n\n*brogue (accent)\n*hod (a tool to carry bricks in) (Slang term for a tankard or drinking vessel)\n*tippler's way (a tippler is a drunkard)\n*craythur (craythur is poteen (Poit\u00edn), \"a drop of the craythur\" is an expression to have some poteen)\n*Whack fol the dah (non-lexical vocalsinging called \"lilting\"; see Scat singing and mouth music it is also punned upon repeatedly by James Joyce as Whack 'fol the Danaan')\n*trotters (feet)\n*full (drunk)\n*mavourneen (my darling)\n*hould your gob (shut-up)\n*belt in the gob (punch in the mouth)\n*Shillelagh law (a brawl)\n*ruction (a fight)\n*bedad (an expression of shock)\n\nNon-English phrases:\n*Thanam 'on dhoul (Irish: Th'anam 'on diabhal, \"your soul to the devil\") However, in other versions of the song, Tim says \"Thunderin' Jaysus.\"\n\nUse in literature \n\nThe song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the \"water of life\", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word \"wake\" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of \"Finnegans\", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  \n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage. \n\nRecordings \n\nMany Irish bands have performed Finnegan's Wake including notably:\n\n*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including Come Fill Your Glass with Us (1959), A Spontaneous Performance Recording (1961), Recorded Live in Ireland (1965), and the 1984 Reunion concert at Lincoln Center. \n*The Dubliners on several live albums. \n*Dropkick Murphys on their albums Do or Die and Live on St. Patrick's Day From Boston, MA. \n*Brobdingnagian Bards on their album Songs of Ireland.\n*The Tossers on their album Communication & Conviction: Last Seven Years.\n*Orthodox Celts on their album The Celts Strike Again.\n*Darby O'Gill on their album Waitin' for a Ride.\n*Ryan's Fancy on their album Newfoundland Drinking Songs.\n*Beatnik Turtle on their album Sham Rock\n*Irish Rovers\n*Christy Moore on his album The Box Set 1964\u20132004\n*Donut Kings on their single Donut Kings Pub With No Beer\n*Schooner Fare on their album Finnegan's Wake\n*Woods Tea Company on their album The Wood's Tea Co. \u2013 Live!\n*Steve Benbow on his album Songs of Ireland\n*Roger McGuinn in his Folk Den series.\n*Dominic Behan on his album Down by the Liffeyside\n*Poxy Boggards on their albums Barley Legal and Bitter and Stout\n*Seamus Kennedy on his album By Popular Demand\n*The High Kings on their albums Memory Lane and Live in Ireland\nQuestion:\n\"What is the occupation of the title character in \"\"Finnegan's Wake\"\" by James Joyce?\"\nAnswer:\nHodcarrier\nPassage:\nFrame drum\nA frame drum is a drum that has a drumhead width greater than its depth. Usually the single drumhead is made of rawhide or man-made materials. Shells are traditionally constructed of bent wood (rosewood, oak, ash etc.) scarf jointed together; plywood and man-made materials are also used. Some frame drums have mechanical tuning and on many the drumhead is stretched and tacked in place. It is the earliest skin drum known to have existed. Examples are found in many places and cultures. It has been suggested  that they were also used to winnow grain.\n\nThe frame drum is one of the most ancient musical instruments; it is reputed to be the first drum to be invented. Frame drums are often constructed with a round, wooden frame. Metal rings or jingles may also be attached to the frame.

In addition to numerous fossil species, up to sixteen extant species are currently recognized, classified into between four and eight genera. The family includes the domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus or Sus domesticus, in addition to numerous species of wild pig, such as the babirusa Babyrousa babyrussa and the warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus. All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia and its islands, to Europe, and Africa.\n\nThe earliest fossil suids date from the Oligocene epoch of Asia, and their descendants reached Europe during the Miocene.  Several fossil species are known, and show adaptations to a wide range of different diets, from strict herbivory to possible carrion-eating (in Tetraconodon).\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nSuids belong to the order Artiodactyla, and are generally regarded as the living members of that order most similar to the ancestral form. Unlike most other members of the order, they have four toes on each foot, although they walk only on the middle two digits, with the others staying clear of the ground. They also have a simple stomach, rather than the more complex, ruminant, stomach found in most other artiodactyl families.\n\nThey are small to medium animals, varying in size from 58 to in length, and 6 to in weight in the case of the pygmy hog, to 130 - and 100 - in the giant forest hog.  They have large heads and short necks, with relatively small eyes and prominent ears. Their heads have a distinctive snout, ending in a disc-shaped nose. Suids typically have a bristly coat, and a short tail ending in a tassle. The males possess a corkscrew-shaped penis, which fits into a similarly shaped groove in the female's cervix.   \n\nSuids have a well-developed sense of hearing, and are vocal animals, communicating with a series of grunts, squeals, and similar sounds. They also have an acute sense of smell. Many species are omnivorous, eating grass, leaves, roots, insects, worms, and even frogs or mice. Other species are more selective and purely herbivorous.\n\nTheir teeth reflect their diet, and suids retain the upper incisors, which are lost in most other Artiodactyls. The canine teeth are enlarged to form prominent tusks, used for rooting in moist earth or undergrowth, and in fighting. They have only a short diastema. The number of teeth varies between species, but the general dental formula is: \n\nBehaviour and reproduction\n\nSuids are intelligent and adaptable animals. Adult females (sows) and their young travel in a group (sounder; see List of animal names), while adult males (boars) are either solitary, or travel in small bachelor groups. Males generally are not territorial, and come into conflict only during the mating season.\n\nLitter size varies between one and twelve, depending on the species. The mother prepares a grass nest or similar den, which the young leave after about ten days. Suids are weaned at around three months, and become sexually mature at 18 months. In practice, however, male suids are unlikely to gain access to sows in the wild until they have reached their full physical size, at around four years of age.

In addition to numerous fossil species, up to sixteen extant species are currently recognized, classified into between four and eight genera. The family includes the domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus or Sus domesticus, in addition to numerous species of wild pig, such as the babirusa Babyrousa babyrussa and the warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus. All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia and its islands, to Europe, and Africa.\n\nThe earliest fossil suids date from the Oligocene epoch of Asia, and their descendants reached Europe during the Miocene.  Several fossil species are known, and show adaptations to a wide range of different diets, from strict herbivory to possible carrion-eating (in Tetraconodon).\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nSuids belong to the order Artiodactyla, and are generally regarded as the living members of that order most similar to the ancestral form. Unlike most other members of the order, they have four toes on each foot, although they walk only on the middle two digits, with the others staying clear of the ground. They also have a simple stomach, rather than the more complex, ruminant, stomach found in most other artiodactyl families.\n\nThey are small to medium animals, varying in size from 58 to in length, and 6 to in weight in the case of the pygmy hog, to 130 - and 100 - in the giant forest hog.  They have large heads and short necks, with relatively small eyes and prominent ears. Their heads have a distinctive snout, ending in a disc-shaped nose. Suids typically have a bristly coat, and a short tail ending in a tassle. The males possess a corkscrew-shaped penis, which fits into a similarly shaped groove in the female's cervix.   \n\nSuids have a well-developed sense of hearing, and are vocal animals, communicating with a series of grunts, squeals, and similar sounds. They also have an acute sense of smell. Many species are omnivorous, eating grass, leaves, roots, insects, worms, and even frogs or mice. Other species are more selective and purely herbivorous.\n\nTheir teeth reflect their diet, and suids retain the upper incisors, which are lost in most other Artiodactyls. The canine teeth are enlarged to form prominent tusks, used for rooting in moist earth or undergrowth, and in fighting. They have only a short diastema. The number of teeth varies between species, but the general dental formula is: \n\nBehaviour and reproduction\n\nSuids are intelligent and adaptable animals. Adult females (sows) and their young travel in a group (sounder; see List of animal names), while adult males (boars) are either solitary, or travel in small bachelor groups. Males generally are not territorial, and come into conflict only during the mating season.\n\nLitter size varies between one and twelve, depending on the species. The mother prepares a grass nest or similar den, which the young leave after about ten days. Suids are weaned at around three months, and become sexually mature at 18 months. In practice, however, male suids are unlikely to gain access to sows in the wild until they have reached their full physical size, at around four years of age. In all species, the male is significantly larger than the female, and possesses more prominent tusks.\n\nClassification\n\n \nThe complete list of living species, and a partial list of extinct genera known from the fossil record,   extinct taxa marked with a dagger \"\u2020\", are:\n\n*Suidae\n**Subfamily \u2020Cainochoerinae\n***Genus \u2020Albanohyus\n***Genus \u2020Cainochoerus\n**Subfamily \u2020Hyotheriinae\n***Genus \u2020Aureliachoerus\n***Genus \u2020Chicochoerus\n***Genus \u2020Hyotherium\n***Genus \u2020Nguruwe (formerly placed in Kubanochoerinae) \n***Genus \u2020Xenohyus\n**Subfamily \u2020Listriodontinae \n***Tribe \u2020Kubanochoerini\n****Genus \u2020Kubanochoerus (junior synonyms Libycochoerus, Megalochoerus)\n***Tribe \u2020Listriodontini\n****Genus \u2020Eurolistriodon\n****Genus \u2020Listriodon (junior synonym Bunolistriodon)\n***Tribe \u2020Namachoerini\n****Genus \u2020Lopholistriodon\n****Genus \u2020Namachoerus\n***Tribe incertae sedis\n****Genus \u2020Dicoryphochoerus\n**Subfamily Suinae\n***Tribe Babyrousini\n****Genus Babyrousa (Pleistocene to recent)\n*****Species B. babyrussa Buru babirusa\n*****Species \u2020B. bolabatuensis Bola Batu babirusa\n*****Species Babyrousa celebensis North Sulawesi babirusa\n*****Species Babyrousa togeanensis Togian babirusa\n***Tribe \u2020Hippohyini\n****Genus \u2020Hippohyus (Miocene to Pleistocene)\n****Genus \u2020Sinohyus (Miocene)\n****Genus \u2020Sivahyus (Miocene to Pliocene)\n***Tribe Potamochoerini\n****Genus \u2020Celebochoerus (Pliocene to Pleistocene)\n****Genus Hylochoerus (Pleistocene to recent)\n*****Species Hylochoerus meinertzhageni giant forest hog\n****Genus \u2020Kolpochoerus (Pliocene to Pleistocene) (junior synonyms Ectopotamochoerus, Mesochoerus, Omochoerus, Promesochoerus)\n****Genus Potamochoerus (Miocene to recent)\n*****Species P. larvatus bushpig\n*****Species P. porcus red river hog\n****Genus \u2020Propotamochoerus (Miocene to Pliocene)\n***Tribe Suini\n****Genus \u2020Eumaiochoerus (Miocene)\n****Genus \u2020Hippopotamodon (Miocene to Pleistocene)  (junior synonym Limnostonyx)\n****Genus \u2020Korynochoerus (Miocene to Pliocene)\n****Genus \u2020Microstonyx (Miocene)\n****Genus Sus (Miocene to recent)\n*****Species S. ahoenobarbus Palawan bearded pig\n*****Species S. barbatus Bornean bearded pig\n*****Species S. bucculentus Heude's pig or Vietnamese warty pig\n*****Species S. cebifrons Visayan warty pig\n*****Species S. celebensis Celebes warty pig\n*****Species S. heureni Flores warty pig\n*****Species S. oliveri Mindoro warty pig\n*****Species S. philippensis Philippine warty pig\n*****Species S. scrofa (also called S. domesticus) domestic pig, wild boar\n*****Species S. verrucosus Java warty pig\n*****Species \u2020S. strozzi\n***Tribe Phacochoerini\n****Genus \u2020Metridiochoerus (Pliocene to Pleistocene)\n****Genus Phacochoerus (Pliocene to recent)\n*****Species P. aethiopicus Cape, Somali or desert warthog\n*****Species P. africanus common warthog\n****Genus \u2020Potamochoeroides (Pliocene, possibly Pleistocene)\n****Genus \u2020Stylochoerus (Pleistocene)\n***Tribe incertae sedis  \n****Genus Porcula\n*****Species P. salvania pygmy hog\n** Subfamily \u2020Tetraconodontinae\n*** Genus \u2020Conohyus\n*** Genus \u2020Notochoerus\n*** Genus \u2020Nyanzachoerus\n*** Genus \u2020Parachleuastochoerus\n*** Genus \u2020Sivachoerus\n*** Genus \u2020Tetraconodon (Miocene, Myanmar)  \n****Species \u2020T. intermedius\n****Species \u2020T. malensis\n****Species \u2020T. minor\n**Subfamily incertae sedis\n***Genus \u2020Chleuastochoerus\n***Genus \u2020Hemichoerus\n***Genus \u2020Hyosus\n***Genus \u2020Kenyasus (formerly placed in Kubanochoerinae)\n***Genus \u2020Schizochoerus\n***Genus \u2020Sinapriculus\nQuestion:\nArtiodactyla Suidae is the scientific name for which farm animal?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nErrol Brown\nLester Errol Brown MBE (12 November 1943 \u2013 6 May 2015) was a British-Jamaican singer and songwriter, best known as the frontman of the soul and funk band Hot Chocolate.  \n\nCareer\n\nBrown was born in Kingston, Jamaica, but moved to the UK when he was twelve years old. His break in music came in 1969 when he recorded a version of John Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance\" with a band called \"Hot Chocolate Band\". Unable to change the lyrics without Lennon's permission, he sent a copy to his record label, Apple, and the song was released with Lennon's approval. \n\nThe Hot Chocolate albums were produced by Mickie Most and recorded at the Rak Records studio. Brown left the group in 1985 to take a hiatus from music.   He soon went on to have a solo career, achieving success in the clubs with the 1987 single \"Body Rocking\", produced by Richard James Burgess. \n\nBrown was a supporter of the Conservative Party and performed at a party conference in the 1980s. In 1981, he performed at the wedding reception following the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, at Buckingham Palace. \n\nBrown owned National Hunt horses, including Gainsay. \n\nRecognition\n\nIn 2003, Queen Elizabeth II named Brown a Member of the Order of the British Empire for \"services to popular music for the United Kingdom\".   In 2004 he received an Ivor Novello Award for outstanding contributions to British music.\n\nDeath\n\nBrown died of liver cancer at his home in the Bahamas on 6 May 2015.

It is one of four Long Distance Routes in Scotland. It begins in Aviemore and ends at Buckpool harbour in Buckie, some 65 miles away. Some choose to walk the route from Buckie to Aviemore.  There is a spur leading off the main route to Tomintoul bringing the total distance up to 80 miles (130 km). In addition, there is a Dufftown loop option, and other less well-known routes (Badenoch Way, Dava Way, and Moray Coast Trail) can be worked in, all affecting the total distance walked.  Sections of the route are open to cycling.\n\nThe Way is clearly marked with a symbol showing a thistle in a hexagon.  The route generally follows the valley of the River Spey, passing some of the distilleries that produce Speyside single malts. The final five miles from Spey Bay to Buckie follow the coastline.\n\nAn extension of the route from Aviemore to Newtonmore is currently being progressed. This extension would lengthen the total route by , roughly following the route of the River Spey and utilising part of the Sustrans cycle route. The first part of the extension, to Kincraig, was opened in 2015.\n\nA formal proposal has now been submitted and has received approval in principle from Scottish Ministers, but it still looks likely that not all landowners will be in agreement with the designated route. If instructed by the Scottish Ministers, the Cairngorms National Park Authority can implement the route against landowners' wishes under the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 and the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Negotiations are still underway to attempt to avoid this situation.\n\nThe path follows most of the route of the former Strathspey Railway.\nQuestion:\nThe 81 mile Speyside Way runs from Buckie to which town and resort in the Cairngorms?\nAnswer:\nAviemore\nPassage:\nAare\nThe Aare or Aar is a tributary of the High Rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within Switzerland.\n\nIts total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about 295 km (183 miles), during which distance it descends 1565 m, draining an area of 17779 km2, almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of Central Switzerland.  \nThere are more than 40 hydroelectric plants along the course of the Aare River.\n\nThe river's name dates to at least the La T\u00e8ne period, and it is attested as Nantaror \"Aare valley\" in the Berne zinc tablet which dates back to Roman Gaul. \nThe name was Latinized as Arula/Arola/Araris. \n\nCourse\n\nThe Aare rises in the great Aargletschers (Aare Glaciers) of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass. The Finsteraargletscher and Lauteraargletscher come together to form the Unteraargletscher (Lower Aare-Glacier), which is the main source of water for the Grimselsee. The Oberaargletscher (Upper Aare-Glacier) feeds the Oberaarsee, which also flows into the Grimselsee. The Aare river leaves the Grimselsee just to the east to the Grimsel Hospice, below the Grimsel Pass, and then flows northwest through the Haslital, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, 46 m, past Guttannen.\n\nBetween Innertkirchen and Meiringen, the river carves through a limestone ridge in the Aare Gorge or Aareschlucht. It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge. A little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake Brienz. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important tributary, the L\u00fctschine. It then runs across the swampy plain of the B\u00f6deli between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun.\n\nNear the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the Kander, which has just been joined by the Simme. Lake Thun marks the head of navigation. On flowing out of the lake it passes through Thun, and then flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the Saane or Sarine it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne. From the upper end of the lake, at Nidau, the river issues through the Nidau-B\u00fcren channel, also called the Aare Canal, and then runs east to B\u00fcren. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the \"vegetable garden of Switzerland\".\n\nFrom here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town Solothurn (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau, near which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg, where the B\u00fcnz falls in on the right. A short distance further, below Brugg it receives first the Reuss, and shortly afterwards the Limmat. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the Rhine, which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut, Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands.\n\nTributaries \n\n* Limmat\n** Reppisch\n** Sihl\n*** Alp\n*** Minster\n** Linth (main tributary of Lake Z\u00fcrich)\n*** Seez (main tributary of Lake Walen)\n*** L\u00f6ntsch\n*** Sernf\n* Reuss (see also: Reuss (river)#Tributaries)\n** Kleine Emme\n** Sarner Aa\n** Engelberger Aa\n** Sch\u00e4chen\n** Furkareuss\n* Suhre\n* B\u00fcnz\n**Aabach\n* Wigger\n* Murg (Murgenthal)\n**Rot (Roggwil)\n**Langete (Langenthal)\n***Ursenbach (Kleindietwil)\n***Rotbach (Huttwil)\n* Emme  \n* Zihlkanal\n** Suze\n** Broye\n** Orbe\n* Saane (Sarine)\n** Sense\n* Kander\n** Simme\n** Allenbach\n* L\u00fctschine (Lake Brienz)\n\nReservoirs\n\n* Lake Grimsel, 1908 m\n* Lake Brienz, 564 m\n* Lake Thun, 558 m\n* Lake Wohlen, 481 m\n* Niederriedsee, 461 m\n* Lake Biel, 429 m\n* Klingnauer Stausee, 318 m\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\nQuestion:\nWhich European city lies on the river Aare?\nAnswer:\nBerne BE\nPassage:\nDigitalis purpurea\nDigitalis purpurea (foxglove, common foxglove, purple foxglove or lady's glove) is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae, native and widespread throughout most of temperate Europe. It is also naturalised in parts of North America and some other temperate regions. The plants are well known as the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin).\n\nDescription\n\nDigitalis purpurea is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple,  long and  broad, and are covered with gray-white pubescent and glandular hairs, imparting a woolly texture. The foliage forms a tight rosette at ground level in the first year.\n\nThe flowering stem develops in the second year, typically  tall, sometimes longer. The flowers are arranged in a showy, terminal, elongated cluster, and each flower is tubular and pendent. The flowers are typically purple, but some plants, especially those under cultivation, may be pink, rose, yellow, or white. The inside surface of the flower tube is heavily spotted. The flowering period is early summer, sometimes with additional flower stems developing later in the season. The plant is frequented by bees, which climb right inside the flower tube to gain the nectar within.\n\nThe fruit is a capsule which splits open at maturity to release the numerous tiny 0.1-0.2\u00a0mm seeds.\n\nSubspecies\n\nThe three subspecies of Digitalis purpurea are:\n*D. p. subsp. purpurea \u2013 most of Europe\n*D. p. subsp. heywoodii \u2013 Iberia\n*D. p. subsp. mariana \u2013 Iberia\n\nHybrids\n\n* Digitalis x fulva, Lindl. 1821 (hybrid formula: Digitalis grandiflora Mill. \u00d7 Digitalis purpurea L.).\n\nToxicity \n\nDue to the presence of the cardiac glycoside digitoxin, the leaves, flowers and seeds of this plant are all poisonous to humans and some animals and can be fatal if ingested.\n\nExtracted from the leaves, this same compound, whose clinical use was pioneered as digitalis by William Withering, is used as a medication for heart failure. He recognized it \"reduced dropsy\", increased urine flow and had a powerful effect on the heart. Unlike the purified pharmacological forms, extracts of this plant did not frequently cause intoxication because they induced nausea and vomiting within minutes of ingestion, preventing the patient from consuming more.\n\nThe main toxins in Digitalis spp. are the two chemically similar cardiac glycosides: digitoxin and digoxin. Like other cardiac glycosides, these toxins exert their effects by inhibiting the ATPase activity of a complex of transmembrane proteins that form the sodium potassium ATPase pump, (Na+/K+-ATPase). Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in turn causes a rise not only in intracellular Na+, but also in calcium, which in turn results in increased force of myocardial muscle contractions. In other words, at precisely the right dosage, Digitalis toxin can cause the heart to beat more strongly. However, digitoxin, digoxin and several other cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, are known to have steep dose-response curves, i.e., minute increases in the dosage of these drugs can make the difference between an ineffective dose and a fatal one.\n\nSymptoms of Digitalis poisoning include a low pulse rate, nausea, vomiting, and uncoordinated contractions of different parts of the heart, leading to cardiac arrest and finally death.\n\nCultivation \n\nThe plant is popular as a garden subject, and numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of colours from white through pink to purple, such as \"Dalmatian Purple\". Cultivated forms often show flowers completely surrounding the central spike, in contrast to the wild form, where the flowers only appear on one side.  D. purpurea is easily grown from seed or purchased as potted plants in the spring. The following selections have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n*'The Shirley' \n*'Excelsior group' \n*D. purpurea f. alba \n\nDigitalis purpurea is hardy to zones 4-9. \n\nUses\n\nDigoxigenin (DIG) is a steroid found exclusively in the flowers and leaves of the plants Digitalis purpurea and Digitalis lanata. It is used as a molecular probe to detect DNA or RNA. It can easily be attached to nucleotides by chemical modifications. DIG molecules are often linked to uridine nucleotides; DIG-labeled uridine (DIG-U) can then be incorporated into RNA probes via in vitro transcription. Once hybridisation occurs in situ, RNA probes with the incorporated DIG-U can be detected with anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. To reveal the hybridised transcripts, alkaline phosphatase can be reacted with a chromogen to produce a coloured precipitate.\n\nGenetics\n\nThe colours of the petals of the Digitalis purpurea are known to be determined by at least three genes that interact with each other. \n\nThe M gene determined the production of a purple pigment, a type of antocianin. The m gene does not produce this pigment. The D gene is an enhances of the M gene, and leads it to produce a big amount of the pigment. The d gene does not enhance the M gene, and only a small amount of pigment is produced. Lastly, the W gene makes the pigment be deposited only in some spots, while the w gene allows the pigment to be spread all over the flower.\n\nThis combination leads to four phenotypes:\n\n*M/_; W/_; _/_ = a white flower with purple spots;\n*m/m; _/_; _/_ = an albino flower with yellow spots;\n*M/_; w/w; d/d = a light purple flower;\n*M/_; w/w; D/_ = a dark purple flower.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThis plant inspired a famous poem by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli titled \"Digitale Purpurea\". It also inspired the Italian industrial metal band Digitalis Purpurea.\n\nThis plant features in the 2015 video game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It is one of several harvestable plants within the game, and is used for the production of tranquilizer rounds by the Mother Base R&D team\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Digitalis Purpurea.jpg\nImage:Digitalis_purpurea_alba_01-Juni.jpg|f.albiflora\nImage:Fingerborgsblomma, closeup.jpg|Close-up of flower\nImage:Digitalis_purpurea_-_K\u00f6hler\u2013s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-053.jpg|19th century illustration\nImage:Digitalis purpurea 'Primrose Carousel' Flower Closeup 1200px.jpg|Flower close-up\nImage:Digitalis purpurea 'Primrose Carousel' Leaves 1100px.jpg|Leaves\nFile: Digitalis seed 2.JPG|Young plant a few weeks old\nFile:Digitalis_purpurea_004.JPG|Giant flower demonstrating pseudo-peloria\nQuestion:\nWhat is the alternative name for the flower digitalis purpurea?\nAnswer:\nC36H56O14\nPassage:\nA Rake's Progress\nA Rake's Progress is a series of eight paintings by 18th-century English artist William Hogarth. The canvases were produced in 1732\u201333, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. \n\nPaintings\n\nAdaptations\n\nGavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled \"The Rake's Progress\" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.\nQuestion:\nWho painted The Rake's Progress?\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nNine Elms\nNine Elms is a district of London, situated in the far north-eastern corner of the London Borough of Wandsworth between Battersea and Vauxhall in the neighbouring borough of Lambeth.\n\nThe area was formerly mainly industrial but is now becoming more residential and commercial in character. It is dominated by Battersea Power Station, various railway lines and New Covent Garden Market. Also in the area is the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.\n\nNine Elms has residential developments along the riverside, like Chelsea Bridge Wharf or Embassy Gardens, and also three large council estates\u2014Carey Gardens, the Patmore and the Savona.\n\nHistory\n\nNine Elms Lane was named around 1645, from a row of elm trees bordering the road. In 1838, at the time of construction of the London and Southampton Railway, the area was described as \"a low swampy district occasionally overflowed by the Thames [whose] osier beds, pollards and windmille and the river give it a Dutch effect\".\n\nNine Elms railway station opened on 21 May 1838 as the first London terminus of the London and South Western Railway, which that day changed its name from the London and Southampton Railway. The neo-classical building was designed by Sir William Tite. The station was connected to points between Vauxhall and London Bridge by Thames steam boats. It closed in 1848 when the railway was extended to a new terminus at Waterloo station (then called Waterloo Bridge Station). The redundant station and the adjacent area, to the north of the new mainline, became the London and South Western Railway's carriage and wagon works and main locomotive works until their relocation to Eastleigh in 1909.  The company's largest locomotive depot was located on the south side of the main line. The buildings were damaged by bombs in World War II, and closed in 1967. They were demolished in 1968 and replaced by the flower section of the New Covent Garden Market. \n\nGasworks were established in 1853, close to the existing waterworks of the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company. Later Battersea Power Station was built on the site.\n\nVauxhall Motors was formed in 1857 by Scottish engineer Alexander Wilson at Nine Elms, originally as Alex Wilson and Company, before moving to Luton in 1907. There is a plaque commemorating the site of the original factory at the Sainsbury's Nine Elms petrol station on Wandsworth Road.\n\nFuture\n\nIn October 2008 the U.S. Embassy in London announced that it would relocate to the area, moving from its current location in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair;  the new embassy is slated for completion in 2017.  The Embassy of the Netherlands in London also announced in April 2013 that it was relocating to the area from its current location in Hyde Park Gate, Kensington.  The Chinese Embassy is also rumoured to be relocating to the area. \n\nOn 16 February 2012, Wandsworth Council approved Ballymore Group's plans for the 15 acre development. Embassy Gardens is set to provide \"up to 1,982 new homes alongside shops, cafes, bars, restaurants, business space, a 100 bed hotel, a health centre, children's playgrounds and sports pitches\".Wandsworth Council: [http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/news/article/11030/embassy_gardens_plans_approved Embassy Gardens plans approved | Wandsworth Council], accessdate: 9 September 2014 In 2014, it was reported that Ballymore had engaged Lazard and CBRE Group to raise about \u20ac2.5bn to fund the Embassy Gardens development.Independent.ie: [http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/nick-webb-mulryan-is-close-to-wiping-slate-clean-30301129.html Nick Webb: Mulryan is close to wiping slate clean - Independent.ie], accessdate: 1 September 2014\n\nWork commenced in 2013 on regeneration of the area around Battersea Power Station, including shops, cafes, restaurants, art and leisure facilities, office space and residential buildings. An essential part of the work is an extension of the London Underground to service the area. The proposed extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea - creating two new stations.  The station structure itself is expected to be repaired and secure by 2016, with completion of the whole project by 2020.\n\nPart of these plans is the creation of the linear park \u2013 a car-free area extending from Battersea Power Station to Vauxhall Cross. The park will open out onto other public areas such as shops, hotels and other parks and public squares alongside homes and residential areas.The linear park will open up onto the Thames River Path at numerous points along the path, allowing access to the river\u2019s edge and the beautiful views so rare in urban areas. \n\nIn 2015, Wandsworth council chose a design by Bystrup for a \u00a340m pedestrian bridge between Nine Elms and Pimlico.\nQuestion:\nWhat moved to Nine Elms in 1974?\nAnswer:\nPubs in Covent Garden\nPassage:\nTim Gudgin\nTim Gudgin (born 26 November 1929) is a retired British radio presenter and voiceover artist. He was best known for announcing the football results on the BBC sports programmes Grandstand and Final Score between 1995 and 2011. He read the results out for the last time on 19 November 2011, just a week before his 82nd birthday. \n\nEducation and early career\n\nHe was educated at the independent Whitgift School in South Croydon, London, but did not go to university. He carried out his National Service during the 1940s, and he started his broadcasting career during that time in Germany in 1949. After completing his National Service he started a long career at the BBC.\n\nGrandstand and Final Score\n\nHe began working on Grandstand in the 1960s, initially announcing the rugby and racing results, but then succeeded Len Martin as the broadcaster of the football results after Martin's death in 1995. Gudgin was only the second person to perform the role regularly from the inception of Grandstand in 1958. After Grandstand ended in 2007, he continued to read the results on Final Score.\n\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker described Gudgin as \"one of the most familiar voices in sport\" and \"a quintessential part of Saturday afternoons in this country\".   \n\nOther work\n\nHis voice has been heard on the BBC Radio 4 quiz Quote... Unquote, Housewives' Choice, Top of the Form and Friday Night is Music Night, amongst others. Interviewed in November 2011 Gudgin said, \"I did an in-vision commercial for Square Deal Surf which bought me the first house I ever had without a mortgage, so that was well worth it.\" \n\nPersonal life\n\nGudgin is a Crystal Palace supporter and lives in Emsworth, Hampshire. He is also said to be a fan of The Fall and once persuaded Mark E. Smith to read the football scores.[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/03/01/fighting_sailors_filthy_dunkin.html Guardian Unlimited: Sport blog: Fighting sailors, filthy dunks and the genius of Jean-Pierre Papin]\n\nRetirement\n\nHe announced just prior to reading the results on the 6 August 2011 that the 2011-2012 season would be his last before retirement, with his last reading on 19 November 2011.  He later cited several reasons for his retirement including his age, the distance he would have to travel following the BBC's relocation to Salford and his granddaughter's wedding in Australia which he wanted to be there for.\n\nHis successor on Final Score is Mike West, who was the presenter of sports bulletins on BBC Radio Lancashire.\nQuestion:\nWhich BBC Radio Lancashire presenter succeeded Tim Gudgin as reader of the sports results on Grandstand and Final Score?\nAnswer:\nMichael West\nPassage:\nMost prolific mother ever | Guinness World Records\nMost prolific mother ever | Guinness World Records\nMost prolific mother ever\nWhere\nRussia Shuya\nThe greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is 69, to the wife of Feodor Vassilyev (b. 1707\u2013c.1782), a peasant from Shuya, Russia. In 27 confinements she gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets.\n***\nNumerous contemporaneous sources exist, which suggest that this seemingly improbably and statistically unlikely story is true.\nThe case was reported to Moscow by the Monastery of Nikolsk on 27 Feb 1782, which had recorded every birth. It is noted that, by this time, only two of the children who were born in the period c. 1725\u201365 failed to survive their infancy.\nThe Gentleman's Magazine (1783, 53, 753) recounts: \"In an original letter now before me, dated St Petersburg, Aug 13, 1782, O. S. Feodor Wassilief [sic], aged 75, a peasant, said to be now alive and in perfect health, in the Government of Moscow, has had\u2013\nBy his first wife:\n---------\n8 births 18 children\nIn all, 35 births, 87 children, of which 84 are living and only three buried. . . The above relation, however astonishing, may be depended upon, as it came directly from an English merchant at St Petersburg to his relatives in England, who added that the peasant was to be introduced to the Empress.\"\nIn Saint Petersburg Panorama, Bashutski, 1834, the author notes that:\n\"In the day of 27 February 1782, the list from Nikolskiy monastery came to Moscow containing the information that a peasant of the Shuya  district, Feodor Vassilyev, married twice, had 87 children. His first wife in 27 confinements gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets. His second wife in eight confinements gave birth to six pairs of twins and two sets of triplets. F. Vassilyev was 75 at that time with 82 of his children alive.\"\nAnd the Lancet (1878) refers to a twin study carried out by the French Academy and:\n\"Apropos of the enquiry, the Committee of the Academy recall an account of a quite extraordinary fecundity that was published by M. Hermann in his \"Travaux Statistiques de la Russie,\" for Fedor Vassilet [sic]. . . who, in 1782, was aged 75 years, had had, by two wives, 87 children.\"\nAside from this, not much is known about the first Mrs Vassilyev - even her first name (although some sources claim her name was Valentina).\nIt is thought she lived to the age of 76.\nAlthough this historic record should be taken with a pinch of salt, it is certainly conceivable that Mrs Vassilyev could have had a genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate (release multiple eggs in one cycle), which significantly increases the chance of having twins or multiple children.\nIt is also not impossible for a woman to have 27 pregnancies during her fertile years.\nAll records listed on our website are current and up-to-date.

Additionally, due to radioactive decay, the ore also contains oxides of lead and trace amounts of helium. It may also contain thorium, and rare earth elements.\n\nIt used to be known as pitchblende (from pitch, because of its black color, and blende, a term used by German miners to denote minerals whose density suggested metal content, but whose exploitation, at the time they were named, was either unknown, impossible or not economically feasible). The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the Ore Mountains, on the German/Czech border. The type locality is the historic mining and spa town known as Joachimsthal, the modern day J\u00e1chymov, on the Czech side of the mountains, where F.E. Br\u00fcckmann described the mineral in 1772. Pitchblende from the Johanngeorgenstadt deposit in Germany was used by M. Klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium. \n\nAll uraninite minerals contain a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Marie Curie used pitchblende, processing tons of it herself, as the source material for her isolation of radium in 1898.\n\nUraninite also always contains small amounts of the lead isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb, the end products of the decay series of the uranium isotopes 238U and 235U respectively. Small amounts of helium are also present in uraninite as a result of alpha decay. Helium was first found on Earth in uraninite after having been discovered spectroscopically in the Sun's atmosphere. The extremely rare elements technetium and promethium can be found in uraninite in very small quantities (about 200\u00a0pg/kg and 4\u00a0fg/kg respectively), produced by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238.\n\nOccurrence\n\nUraninite is a major ore of uranium. Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the initial source for the Manhattan Project) and in the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, Canada.  Another important source of pitchblende is at Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with silver. It also occurs in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany, England, Rwanda and South Africa. In the United States it can be found in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina and Wyoming. The geologist Charles Steen made a fortune on the production of Uraninite in his Mi Vida mine in Moab, Utah.\n\nUranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into yellowcake, which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.\nQuestion:\nPitchblende is the chief ore of which metallic element?\nAnswer:\n234U\nPassage:\nFinnegan's Wake\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is a ballad that arose in the 1850s in the music-hall tradition of comical Irish songs. The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born \"with a love for the liquor\", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection\u2014whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha, meaning \"water of life\". \n\nUncommon or non-standard English phrases and terms\n\n*brogue (accent)\n*hod (a tool to carry bricks in) (Slang term for a tankard or drinking vessel)\n*tippler's way (a tippler is a drunkard)\n*craythur (craythur is poteen (Poit\u00edn), \"a drop of the craythur\" is an expression to have some poteen)\n*Whack fol the dah (non-lexical vocalsinging called \"lilting\"; see Scat singing and mouth music it is also punned upon repeatedly by James Joyce as Whack 'fol the Danaan')\n*trotters (feet)\n*full (drunk)\n*mavourneen (my darling)\n*hould your gob (shut-up)\n*belt in the gob (punch in the mouth)\n*Shillelagh law (a brawl)\n*ruction (a fight)\n*bedad (an expression of shock)\n\nNon-English phrases:\n*Thanam 'on dhoul (Irish: Th'anam 'on diabhal, \"your soul to the devil\") However, in other versions of the song, Tim says \"Thunderin' Jaysus.\"\n\nUse in literature \n\nThe song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the \"water of life\", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word \"wake\" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of \"Finnegans\", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  \n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage. \n\nRecordings \n\nMany Irish bands have performed Finnegan's Wake including notably:\n\n*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including Come Fill Your Glass with Us (1959), A Spontaneous Performance Recording (1961), Recorded Live in Ireland (1965), and the 1984 Reunion concert at Lincoln Center. \n*The Dubliners on several live albums. \n*Dropkick Murphys on their albums Do or Die and Live on St. Patrick's Day From Boston, MA. \n*Brobdingnagian Bards on their album Songs of Ireland.\n*The Tossers on their album Communication & Conviction: Last Seven Years.\n*Orthodox Celts on their album The Celts Strike Again.\n*Darby O'Gill on their album Waitin' for a Ride.\n*Ryan's Fancy on their album Newfoundland Drinking Songs.\n*Beatnik Turtle on their album Sham Rock\n*Irish Rovers\n*Christy Moore on his album The Box Set 1964\u20132004\n*Donut Kings on their single Donut Kings Pub With No Beer\n*Schooner Fare on their album Finnegan's Wake\n*Woods Tea Company on their album The Wood's Tea Co. \u2013 Live!\n*Steve Benbow on his album Songs of Ireland\n*Roger McGuinn in his Folk Den series.\n*Dominic Behan on his album Down by the Liffeyside\n*Poxy Boggards on their albums Barley Legal and Bitter and Stout\n*Seamus Kennedy on his album By Popular Demand\n*The High Kings on their albums Memory Lane and Live in Ireland\nQuestion:\n\"What is the occupation of the title character in \"\"Finnegan's Wake\"\" by James Joyce?\"\nAnswer:\nHodcarrier\nPassage:\nFrame drum\nA frame drum is a drum that has a drumhead width greater than its depth. Usually the single drumhead is made of rawhide or man-made materials. Shells are traditionally constructed of bent wood (rosewood, oak, ash etc.) scarf jointed together; plywood and man-made materials are also used. Some frame drums have mechanical tuning and on many the drumhead is stretched and tacked in place. It is the earliest skin drum known to have existed. Examples are found in many places and cultures. It has been suggested  that they were also used to winnow grain.\n\nThe frame drum is one of the most ancient musical instruments; it is reputed to be the first drum to be invented. Frame drums are often constructed with a round, wooden frame. Metal rings or jingles may also be attached to the frame.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe \"Ride of the Valkyries\" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walk\u00fcre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the \"Ride\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Lohengrin, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walk\u00fcre opera, the \"Ride\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Br\u00fcnnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walk\u00fcre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \"Ride\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \"an utter indiscretion\" and forbade \"any such thing\".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. \u2013 requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\"  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe \"Ride\" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe \"Ride\" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the \"Ride\" is included in the recordings of the Walk\u00fcre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the Ride of the Valkyries\nAnswer:\nWagner's\nPassage:\nHow To Measure Horse Height - Cowboy Way\nMeasure Horse Height\nNote: Links with green  underlines are shopping links and will open in a new window\nHow To Measure Horse Height\nIt's easy to measure you horse's height accurately.\nTo determine how tall a horse is measure the horse, in inches, from  the ground in a straight line up to the highest point of the withers.  This is illustrated in the photo below by the yellow line.\nAbove: The height of a horse is properly measured, in inches,  from the ground to the highest point of the withers.\nFor the most accurate measurement the horse should be on firm, level  ground with its front feet even, or close to even.\nCalculating The Results\nAfter you have measured your horse you will need to  convert the results from inches to \"hands.\" Horse height is correctly referred  to by a unit of measurement  known as a \"hand.\" One hand is equal to four inches.\nThe gray mare in the photo above is 58 inches from the ground  to the top of her withers. When 58 is divided by 4, you have 14.5. The 14 is the  number of hands, and the .5 means another half of a hand, or another 2 inches. This means  she is 14 and one-half hands tall.\nCorrectly Writing And Speaking The Results\nThe correct way of writing \"14 and one-half hands\" is to write \"14.2\". It is not correct to write it as \"14.5\". When  correctly written, the number before the period is the  number of hands, and the number after the period is the remaining number of   inches. The number after the period should NOT stand for a fraction. Horseman  usually say a measurement like this one out loud as \"fourteen two\" or \"fourteen  and a half.\"\nA Few Examples\nBelow are a few examples of how to correctly   write down a horse's height. Remember, the number in front of the period is for  hands and the number after the period is the remaining inches.\n15 - This is a correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.0 - Another correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.1 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 1  inch tall\n15.2 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 2  inches tall\n15.3 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 3  inches tall\n15.4 - Wrong! This means that a horse is 15 hands, 4 inches tall. Since  a hand is equal to four inches, this horse is actually 16 hands tall.\n15.5 - Wrong again! Some people incorrectly use the number after the  period to stand for fractions of a hand, but it should stand for inches. So,  some people write \"15.5\" to mean 15 and a half hands, but this should  correctly be written as \"15.2\".\nIf you like, you can add \"hh\" to a measurement, as in \"15.1hh\".  The \"hh\" stands for \"hands high.\"\nHorse Measuring Devices\nThere are measuring devices on the market for horses  that have hand and inches measurements marked on them. Some devices are rigid  poles with short cross bars toward the top that can be raised or lowered to rest on a  horse's withers. These are very handy and give accurate measurements easily.\nAnother common device is a horse height/weight tape , which is a special tape measure  with hands and inches marked on it. These are inexpensive and are accurate if the person doing the measuring  makes sure to run the tape straight up  and down, and to read the measurement at a level angle.\nWhere Did \"Hands\" Come From?\nAs stated above, a horse's height is measured in  hands. The origin of measuring a horse this way is very old, but easy to  understand. In days long ago people did not have the common measuring devices  (like tape measures, etc.) that we do today. To measure a horse, they used what  was handy (no pun intended): Their hands. At various times in history and in  different locales a \"hand\" was defined as the with of a person's hand  using the fingers only, the width of a person's hand using the fingers and the thumb, the  height of a clenched fist, and possibly others. Somewhere along the way, the  measuring unit of a hand was standardized to mean four inches. Though the  origins are ancient, a hand is still the unit of measurement for horses that  modern horse owners use today.\nQuestion:\nHorses are measured in 'hands', what is the equivalent of a hand in inches?\nAnswer:\nfour  distance\nPassage:\nPrivate Walker\nPrivate Joe Walker is a fictional black market spiv (or Wholesales Supplier, as he politely puts it) and Home Guard platoon member portrayed by actor James Beck on the BBC television sitcom Dad's Army. James Beck died suddenly in 1973, and is featured in just under three-quarters of the episodes. Despite this, the character of Walker was possibly one of the most prominent and popular in the show. Following his character's departure (Walker was last mentioned in the episode \"The Recruit\", although he does not appear in this episode) the series attempted to replace him with a war reporter called Private Cheeseman (played by Talfryn Thomas) who had made a previous cameo appearance in My British Buddy.\n\nPersonality\n\nWalker was the second youngest member of the platoon, the youngest being Pike. A pleasant and amiable (if slightly shifty) personality, Walker is nevertheless a constant thorn in Mainwaring's side as he doesn't share his idealism and makes cheeky and witty interruptions during his serious lectures. However, despite this he is good-natured and loyal to his commanding officer and platoon comrades, and is a valuable asset to the platoon, due to his many \"business\" connections and his ability to mysteriously conjure up almost anything that is rationed or no longer in the shops due to the War - and he will also have it in vast supply (for a price). \n\nPrivate Walker also demonstrates keen improvisational skills and cunning; as a result, owing to these attributes and his cheerful willingness to use tactics that Mainwaring might not consider to be 'cricket', he is usually responsible for getting the platoon out of many of the scrapes that they find themselves in. He is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to make a few bob, and can normally be found trying to sell such things as petrol coupons and black market foodstuffs to his platoon comrades, usually at high prices and from dubious sources. His \"business\" activities are not limited to just the members of the platoon, or indeed even to the residents of Walmington-on-Sea, as he has often made reference to acquiring \"essential supplies\" for members of the rival Eastgate platoon and various influential people, military or civilian; at one point, he offers to provide \"a couple of bottles of scotch\" to a high-ranking GHQ officer, when Mainwaring briefly loses his command of the platoon. Indeed, the only time Walker can't find a buyer for his \"essential supplies\" is when the American Army arrives at Walmington-on-Sea (with the comparatively well-off American troops already having plenty of liquor and other items normally provided by Walker).\n\nWalker considers himself a ladies' man, and his recurring girlfriend Shirley (played by Wendy Richard) is seen in several episodes. In the platoon, he mostly associates with Jones, Pike and Frazer. Despite merely being a Private, Walker clearly has some form of influence over the platoon, not least due to his black-market dealings which have got them out of (and into) numerous scrapes. Moreover, when Frazer is temporarily promoted to Captain in If the Cap Fits..., he selects Walker as his Sergeant. Walker has friendly relationships with all the men in the platoon, jokingly referring to the Scottish Frazer as \"Taffy\", and occasionally calling Jones a \"silly old duffer\" when they have the odd disagreement.\n\nHe is supposedly allergic to corned beef, and this is given as the reason why he has not been called up for the regular army, although it is generally assumed that he has found a way to dodge the rules. This allergy was exposed in the episode The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker, which has since been lost from the BBC's archives. He was conscripted, only to be discharged when it was found that corned beef fritters were the only rations left for the soldiers to eat.  Although a superficially implausible explanation for Walker's discharge it is actually possible to have an [http://www.livestrong.com/article/525254-corned-beef-allergy/ allergy to certain types of corned beef] but not beef itself as a result of various antioxidants that may be used in the curing process.\n\nWalker's final appearance was in the episode Things That Go Bump in the Night, where the platoon spent the night in a mysterious house. In fact he is only seen in the location shots, filmed some time before the studio recording. Beck was ill for the recordings of both this episode and the next, The Recruit, in which the story suggested that Walker had \"gone to the smoke\" (a slang term for London) to \"do a deal\". After Beck's death, Walker was never mentioned in the show (though the character survived the war; the very first episode begins with a scene set in 1968, as Mainwaring, now an alderman, launches his \"I'm Backing Britain\" campaign - Walker is seen as one of the town worthies present at the launch).\n \nIn the radio adaptations of the series, Graham Stark stood in until Larry Martyn gave his portrayal of Walker for subsequent shows. In 1976 John Bardon played Walker in the stage production. Scriptwriter Jimmy Perry originally intended to play the part himself, but was advised against it by his co-writer David Croft. Walker was based on a spiv character created and performed by British comedian and actor Arthur English (English was in the controversial episode Absent Friends and starred in Are You Being Served?).\nQuestion:\nWho played Private Joe Walker in Dad\u2019s Army?\nAnswer:\nJimmy Beck\nPassage:\nJenny Pitman\nJenny Pitman (born 11 June 1946ISBN 1-85225-254-5 \"Jenny Pitman, The Autobiography\" ) is a former British racehorse trainer and author. She became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere won the race in 1983. She went on to win a second Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995. Following her retirement from horse training in 1998 she became a writer of novels, principally with a racing theme.\n\nChildhood\n\nPitman was born as Jenny Harvey on her family's farm near Hoby, Leicestershire, one of seven children. She was brought up assisting in manual farm work, where horse powered equipment was a novelty, and learned to ride a pony \"so young that being on horseback seemed as natural as walking\". In 1957 she left the Hoby village school to attend Sarson Secondary Modern Girls' School in Melton Mowbray. She sustained a fractured skull when a showjumping pole fell on her head during a gymkhana at Syston, it was many months before resultant convulsions were diagnosed. At the age of 14, she obtained a weekend and school holiday job at Brooksby Grange horse racing yard.\n\nPitman left school two weeks before her 15th birthday, taking up a position as a stable girl, at Brooksby Grange for a weekly wage of \u00a33\u00a04s\u00a05d. Her first overnight stop was at Manchester where her filly, Star Princess, won the 1962 Diomedes Handicap. Two years later she changed jobs, moving to a stable in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, the first time she had lived away from her Leicestershire home.\n\nAdult life\n\nPitman worked at Bishop's Cleeve for two years. One day there, she was returning from a workout on the local gallops when her horse was spooked by a cyclist travelling around a corner too fast and on the wrong side of the road. The cyclist in question was jockey Richard Pitman. Jenny's initial reaction to Richard was unfavourable, but later, when Richard obtained a job in Lambourn at Fred Winter's training stables 50 mi from Bishop's Cleeve, Jenny was persuaded to apply for a job in Lambourn with Major Champneys at Church Farm Stables. She moved in 1964.\n\nAged 19, she married Richard Pitman. In August 1966, their son Mark Pitman was born and Jenny became a full-time housewife. Son Paul was born in October 1967. In the next winter, missing the world of horses, they bought a 6 acre property with stables and an indoor school in Hinton Parva to provide a service to other trainers for recuperating injured horses. In 'Parva Stud', the family struggled to live in an unheated caravan. By the end of 1968 Pitman had 8 horses at the yard. With Richard's second place prize from the 1969 Grand National, the Pitmans were able to commission a bungalow on the premises to escape the poor condition caravan. In 1969 she employed a 'lad' to assist at the yard, Melvyn Saddler, who became her right-hand man as her success grew.\n\nIn February 1974, Pitman was able to enter a horse she had trained in her first point-to-point race. Ridden by stable lad Bryan Smart, Road Race didn't figure in the race betting, but amazingly managed to pass the favourite after the last fence to win.\n\nIn 1977 Jenny and Richard divorced and Jenny left Wiltshire and moved to Lambourn, Berkshire. She is now married to businessman, David Stait. In 1975 she was successful in getting her first horse training licence and her first winner came in the very same year.\n\nIn 1983 she became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere was the victor.  She was to win one other Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995 although her horse Esha Ness was first past the post in the void National of 1993. \n \nIn 1998 she was awarded the OBE for services to horseracing  and subsequently retired from training racehorses in 1999, handing over the reins to son, Mark. Pitman was the first winner of the Helen Rollason award at the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year Awards.\n\nAlthough still seen at the races, she is now a prolific writer of novels, principally with a racing spin. \n\nA survivor of thyroid cancer, she is a patron of the British Thyroid Foundation.\nQuestion:\nJenny Pitman was the trainer of which 1995 Grand National winning horse?\nAnswer:\nRoyal Athlete\nPassage:\nDunkery Hill\nDunkery Beacon at the summit of Dunkery Hill is the highest point on Exmoor and in Somerset, England. It is also the highest point in southern England outside of Dartmoor.\n\nThe sandstone hill rises to 1705 ft and provides views over the surrounding moorland, the Bristol Channel and hills up to 86 mi away. The site has been visited by humans since the Bronze Age, and contains several burial mounds in the form of cairns and bowl barrows. Sweetworthy on the lower slopes is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures and a deserted medieval settlement. The hill is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and National nature reserve. It was in private ownership until the 20th century, when it was donated to the National Trust by Sir Thomas Acland, Colonel Wiggin and Allan Hughes; a stone cairn was erected at the summit to commemorate the event.\n\nLocation\n\nDunkery is composed of Middle Devonian sedimentary rock, () known as the Hangman Sandstone Formation.  This supports acidic soils. \nThe ridge along the top of the hill is  long.\n\nAt 1705 ft ordnance datum (OD), the mean height above sea level,  Dunkery Beacon is the highest natural point in Somerset,  although the tip of the Mendip TV Mast is higher at  OD. Dunkery is ranked 23rd in the UK in terms of dominance and is a Marilyn, meaning that it is a peak with 150 m or more of relative height. The nearest higher hill is Yes Tor, 37 mi away. John Fry, a character in R. D. Blackmore's 1869 novel Lorna Doone, calls it the \"haighest place of Hexmoor\". \n\nDunkery lies just 4 mi from the Bristol Channel at Porlock. The shortest route of ascent goes from the car park at Dunkery Gate, and is just  long. There are extensive views from the summit, from where the Bristol and English Channel coasts, the Brecon Beacons including Pen Y Fan, Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor, the Severn Bridges and Cleeve Hill 86 mi away in Gloucestershire are visible. \n\nHistory\n\nDunkery Hill was part of the \"Royal Forest of Exmoor\", established by Henry II according to the late 13th-century Hundred Rolls. There has been some debate about the origin of the name \"Dunkery\" and its predecessors \"Duncrey\" and \"Dunnecray\".  Eilert Ekwall suggests that it comes from the Welsh din meaning hillfort and creic or creag meaning rock.  \n\nThere are several Bronze Age burial mounds at or near the summit.  Two of the largest are Joaney How and Robin How, which have been damaged over many years, although plans have been made to restore and protect them.  \"How\" comes from the Norse for burial mound.  Joaney How on the northern slope, is more than 22 m in diameter.   On the southeastern slopes are four more cairns,  and there are a further two round cairns 390 m and 420 m southeast of Rex Stile Head.  In addition to the cairns are barrows, which also date from the Bronze Age. One bowl barrow on the southeastern spur of the Chains is  in diameter.  A circular funerary stone mound 850 m north of Dunkery Bridge, which is a  walk from the summit, dates from the Neolithic or Bronze Age. It is approximately  high and 14 m in diameter.  \n\nSweetworthy, on Dunkery Hill's north-facing slope, is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures;   one has a single rampart and external ditch, enclosing .  The rampart is still visible, and the ditch on the east side is used as a trackway.   There was a defended settlement above the main site.  It is also the site of a deserted medieval settlement, which has been designated an ancient monument.   It has been added to the Heritage at Risk register because of the vulnerability to plant growth. \n\nIn 1918 Sir Thomas Acland leased part of the land.along with a large part of the Holnicote Estate, for 500 years. Dunkery Hill was put up for sale in 1928. Labour Party activist and Member of Parliament Margaret Bondfield asked in the House of Commons if the government was willing to have it designated an ancient monument, to preserve it for future generations. She received the reply that although the government was agreeable to having the hill listed there were no funds available for its purchase;  the beacon and surrounding mounds were subsequently designated an ancient monument.  The beacon itself, and 960 acre of surrounding land, was donated in 1932 by Colonel W.W. Wiggin. A further 945 acre of nearby land was donated in 1934 by Mrs Hughes in memory of her husband Alan Hughes of Lynch Allerford, Minehead. The donations were commemorated in 1935 with an event when a plaque was attached to the summit memorial cairn. Further parts of the Holnicote Estate, which includes other land donated by the Acland family and others, was given in subsequent years.   \n\nEcology\n\nThe site is part of the North Exmoor Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), part of the Dunkery & Horner Woods National Nature Reserve  and part of the Exmoor Coastal Heaths Special Area of Conservation. \n\nThe hill is blanketed in heather, which gives it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, as well as some unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.\nQuestion:\nDunkery Beacon is the highest point in which English National Park?\nAnswer:\nExmoor National Park\nPassage:\nLicence to Kill (soundtrack)\nThe soundtrack to Licence to Kill, the 16th James Bond film of the same name, was released by MCA Records in 1989.\n\nBecause the usual James Bond composer John Barry (who had scored almost every film from From Russia with Love onwards) was not available at the time as he was undergoing throat surgery, the soundtrack's more upbeat and suspenseful score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen.\n\nInitially Eric Clapton and Vic Flick were asked to write and perform the theme song to Licence to Kill. The theme was said to have been a new version based on the James Bond Theme. The guitar riff heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Flick. \n\nThe prospect, however, fell apart and Gladys Knight's song and performance was chosen, later becoming a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. The song was composed by Narada Michael Walden, Jeffrey Cohen and Walter Afanasieff, based on the \"horn line\" from Goldfinger, which required royalty payments to the original writers.  At five-minutes twelve seconds it is the longest Bond theme. The music video of \"Licence to Kill\" was directed by Daniel Kleinman, who later took over the reins of title designer from Maurice Binder for the 1995 Bond film, GoldenEye.\n\nAll the instrumental tracks are amalgams of various sequences and musical cues from the film rather than straight score excerpts. The end credits of the film feature the song \"If You Asked Me To\" sung by Patti LaBelle. Though the song was a top ten R&B charter and a minor pop hit for LaBelle, in 1992, the song was covered by and became a much bigger hit for singer C\u00e9line Dion. The track \"Wedding Party\", used during the wedding of Felix Leiter to Della Churchill, makes reference to the track \"Jump Up\" from the first Bond film, Dr. No.\n\nTrack listing\n\n# \"Licence to Kill\" \u2013 Gladys Knight\n# \"Wedding Party\" \u2013 Ivory\n# \"Dirty Love\" \u2013 Tim Feehan\n# \"Pam\"\n# \"If You Asked Me To\" \u2013 Patti LaBelle\n# \"James & Felix on Their Way to Church\"contains the James Bond Theme, originally composed for the Dr. No soundtrack\n# \"His Funny Valentine\"\n# \"Sanchez Is in the Bahamas/Shark Fishing\"\n# \"Ninja\"\n# \"Licence Revoked\"\nQuestion:\nCan you name the singer of the title track for '1989 - Licence to Kill'?\nAnswer:\nGladys Knight\nPassage:\nHouses of Parliament | Monet Gallery\nHouses of Parliament | Monet Gallery\nMonet \u2022 Paintings \u2022 Houses of Parliament\nHouses of Parliament\nClaude Monet first went to London in 1870 to escape the Franco-Prussian War. While there he would have seen and been inspired by painters like Turner and began to develop his use of bright colors that would become a defining element of Impressionist painting.\nAfter traveling and moving to Giverny, where he would have his famous gardens, Monet returned to London in 1899 and began work on a series of paintings depicting the Palace of Westminster, also called The House of Parliament, or simply Parliament. His Houses of Parliament series contains 19 canvases all exactly the same size and depicting the same scene from the same vantage point.\nStarting in February 1900, Monet began painting a view of Parliament from across the river Thames. From a terrace on the second floor of the St. Thomas Hospital, Monet could see the Houses of Parliament, including Big Ben, sitting on the edge of the river. In each canvas Parliament is on the right, with water to the left and in front and sky above. As in previous works, these paintings are studies in showing the changing landscape. Because his subject, the light, changes so quickly Monet would sketch out the\nbuilding of Parliament before hand and then paint, adding the color and detail, while looking out his terrace over the river.\nIn previous Series paintings, Haystacks and Rouen Cathedral , Monet showed the effect light and the atmosphere has on objects. While the Parliament series has the building, Westminster Palace is so distorted and obscured by the fog and smog it becomes secondary as the subject. For the Parliament series, we are not just seeing the effect of light on objects we see, Monet is showing the effect of light on the atmosphere itself. Even today London is famous for its fog, and in the 1880\u2019s the Fog was at its peak being heavy and frequent. By 1900, the fog had been decreasing, but was still apparent and being thickened by the smog a result of London\u2019s growing industry.\nThroughout the series of paintings Monet shows the river change from blue and green to bright orange and red lit by the afternoon sun. Monet\u2019s brushstrokes create depth and layers within the fog showing the thickness and weight of the atmosphere. In one painting Parlement, coucher du soleil, 1902, the sun is setting behind the clouds creating highlights and shadows high within the sky turning the river into a mirror reflecting Westminster Palace. In another Houses of Parliament, stormy sky, 1904, almost the entire canvas is orange; as the storm, lit by the high sun, hangs over London darkening Parliament. A few of his canvases show the disc of the sun, visible through the fog and reflecting on the water, while others show a dark sky, the sun hidden behind a thick fog.\nMonet made two trips to London to work on the Houses of Parliament series, in 1900 and 1901. While he painted them from the St. Thomas Hospital, he returned to France with canvases and worked on them for the next three years not showing them until 1904. It may be thought by some viewers that their apparent lack of detail and the years spent working on them by memory may result in a different scene than what he saw, but modern researchers have been able to analyze his works showing his accuracy. By tracing known astrological patterns and solar geometry, not only have scholars been able to pinpoint the exact room and terrace he was painting from, they know the precise times. In fact, his depictions are so accurate that some study them to determine the elements that made up the fog and smog, and changes in the climate by his use of color.\nVisit Monet\nQuestion:\nWhich artist used a terrace at St Thomas' Hospital as a vantage point for his series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament?\nAnswer:\nClaude-Oscar Monet\n\n\nPassage:\nFontanelle\nA fontanelle (or fontanel) (colloquially, soft spot) is an anatomical feature of the infant human skull comprising any of the soft membranous gaps (sutures) between the cranial bones that make up the calvaria of a fetus or an infant. Fontanelles allow for rapid stretching and deformation of the neurocranium as the brain expands faster than the surrounding bone can grow. Premature complete ossification of the sutures is called craniosynostosis.\n\nDuring infancy, the anterior fontanelle is known as the bregma.\n\nStructure\n\nThe skull of a newborn consists of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth.\n\n* Posterior fontanelle is triangle-shaped. It lies at the junction between the sagittal suture and lambdoid suture. At birth, the skull features a small posterior fontanelle with an open area covered by a tough membrane, where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone (at the lambda). The posterior fontanelles ossify within 2 or 3 months of birth. This is called intramembranous ossification.  The mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue.\n* Anterior fontanelle is a diamond-shaped membrane-filled space located between the two frontal and two parietal bones of the developing fetal skull. It persists until approximately 18 months after birth. It is at the junction of the coronal suture and sagittal suture. The fetal anterior fontanelle may be palpated until 18 months. In cleidocranial dysostosis, however, it is often late in closing or may never close.  Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle.\n* Two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head, more anteriorly the sphenoidal or anterolateral fontanelle (between the sphenoid, parietal, temporal, and frontal bones) and more posteriorly the mastoid or posterolateral fontanelle (between the temporal, occipital, and parietal bones).\nDuring birth, fontanelles enable the bony plates of the skull to flex, allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal. The ossification of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close over by 9 to 18 months.  The sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of life. The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium. Other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles, the mastoid fontanelle and the sphenoidal fontanelle are also significant.\n\nClosure\n\nIn humans, the sequence of fontanelle closure is as follows:\n# The posterior fontanelle generally closes 8\u201312 weeks after birth;\n# The sphenoidal fontanelle is the next to close around 6 months after birth;\n# The mastoid fontanelle closes next from 6 to 18 months after birth; and\n# The anterior fontanelle is generally the last to close between 12\u201318 months.\n\nClinical significance\n\nThe fontanelle may pulsate, and although the precise cause of this is not known, it is perfectly normal and seems to echo the heartbeat, perhaps via the arterial pulse within the brain vasculature, or in the meninges. This pulsating action is how the soft spot got its name \u2013 fontanelle is borrowed from the old French word fontenele, which is a diminutive of fontaine, meaning \"spring\". It is assumed that the term spring is used because of the analogy of the dent in a rock or earth where a spring arises. \n\nParents may worry that their infant may be more prone to injury at the fontanelles. In fact, although they may colloquially be called \"soft-spots\", the membrane covering the fontanelles is extremely tough and difficult to penetrate.\n\nFontanelles allow the infant brain to be imaged using ultrasonography. Once they are closed, most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging, because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier.\n\nDisease\n\nFontanelles \u2013 bulging\n\nA very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure. Increased cranial pressure in infants may cause the fontanelles to bulge or the head to begin to enlarge abnormally.  It can occur due to:\n* Encephalitis \u2013 swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections\n* Hydrocephalus \u2013 a buildup of fluid inside the skull\n* Meningitis\u2014infection of the membranes covering the brain\n\nFontanelles \u2013 sunken\n\nA sunken (also called \"depressed\") fontanelle indicates dehydration or malnutrition. \n\nFontanelles \u2013 enlarged\n\nThe fontanelles may be enlarged, may be slow to close or may never close most commonly due to causes like: \n* Down syndrome\n* Hydrocephalus\n* Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)\n* Premature birth\n\nRarer causes include:\n* Achondroplasia\n* Apert syndrome\n* Cleidocranial dysostosis\n* Congenital rubella\n* Neonatal hypothyroidism\n* Osteogenesis imperfecta\n* Rickets\n\nIn other animals\n\nIn apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth. In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age.\n\nIn dogs\n\nNot all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus. In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth, but instead will close slowly over a three- to six-month period. Occasionally these bones fail to close, but the dog is still healthy. In these cases, however, the dog's owners need to be very careful, since any injury or bumps to the animal's head could cause significant brain damage, as well as conditions like epilepsy.\n\nAdditional images\n\n File:Fontanelle.png|Fontanelle.\n File:Anterior fontanelle.jpg|Anterior fontanelle.\n File:Sutures from top.png|Cranial sutures shown from top of head.\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the soft spots on a baby's head which, during birth, enable the bony plates of the skull to flex allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal?\nAnswer:\n", "input": "Passage:\nFontanelle\nA fontanelle (or fontanel) (colloquially, soft spot) is an anatomical feature of the infant human skull comprising any of the soft membranous gaps (sutures) between the cranial bones that make up the calvaria of a fetus or an infant.

Once they are closed, most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging, because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier.\n\nDisease\n\nFontanelles \u2013 bulging\n\nA very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure. Increased cranial pressure in infants may cause the fontanelles to bulge or the head to begin to enlarge abnormally.  It can occur due to:\n* Encephalitis \u2013 swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections\n* Hydrocephalus \u2013 a buildup of fluid inside the skull\n* Meningitis\u2014infection of the membranes covering the brain\n\nFontanelles \u2013 sunken\n\nA sunken (also called \"depressed\") fontanelle indicates dehydration or malnutrition. \n\nFontanelles \u2013 enlarged\n\nThe fontanelles may be enlarged, may be slow to close or may never close most commonly due to causes like: \n* Down syndrome\n* Hydrocephalus\n* Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)\n* Premature birth\n\nRarer causes include:\n* Achondroplasia\n* Apert syndrome\n* Cleidocranial dysostosis\n* Congenital rubella\n* Neonatal hypothyroidism\n* Osteogenesis imperfecta\n* Rickets\n\nIn other animals\n\nIn apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth. In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age.\n\nIn dogs\n\nNot all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus. In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth, but instead will close slowly over a three- to six-month period. Occasionally these bones fail to close, but the dog is still healthy. In these cases, however, the dog's owners need to be very careful, since any injury or bumps to the animal's head could cause significant brain damage, as well as conditions like epilepsy.\n\nAdditional images\n\n File:Fontanelle.png|Fontanelle.\n File:Anterior fontanelle.jpg|Anterior fontanelle.\n File:Sutures from top.png|Cranial sutures shown from top of head.\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the soft spots on a baby's head which, during birth, enable the bony plates of the skull to flex allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe \"Ride of the Valkyries\" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walk\u00fcre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the \"Ride\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Lohengrin, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walk\u00fcre opera, the \"Ride\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Br\u00fcnnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walk\u00fcre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \"Ride\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \"an utter indiscretion\" and forbade \"any such thing\".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. \u2013 requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\"  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe \"Ride\" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe \"Ride\" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the \"Ride\" is included in the recordings of the Walk\u00fcre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the Ride of the Valkyries\nAnswer:\nWagner's\nPassage:\nHow To Measure Horse Height - Cowboy Way\nMeasure Horse Height\nNote: Links with green  underlines are shopping links and will open in a new window\nHow To Measure Horse Height\nIt's easy to measure you horse's height accurately.\nTo determine how tall a horse is measure the horse, in inches, from  the ground in a straight line up to the highest point of the withers.  This is illustrated in the photo below by the yellow line.\nAbove: The height of a horse is properly measured, in inches,  from the ground to the highest point of the withers.\nFor the most accurate measurement the horse should be on firm, level  ground with its front feet even, or close to even.\nCalculating The Results\nAfter you have measured your horse you will need to  convert the results from inches to \"hands.\" Horse height is correctly referred  to by a unit of measurement  known as a \"hand.\" One hand is equal to four inches.\nThe gray mare in the photo above is 58 inches from the ground  to the top of her withers. When 58 is divided by 4, you have 14.5. The 14 is the  number of hands, and the .5 means another half of a hand, or another 2 inches. This means  she is 14 and one-half hands tall.\nCorrectly Writing And Speaking The Results\nThe correct way of writing \"14 and one-half hands\" is to write \"14.2\". It is not correct to write it as \"14.5\". When  correctly written, the number before the period is the  number of hands, and the number after the period is the remaining number of   inches. The number after the period should NOT stand for a fraction. Horseman  usually say a measurement like this one out loud as \"fourteen two\" or \"fourteen  and a half.\"\nA Few Examples\nBelow are a few examples of how to correctly   write down a horse's height. Remember, the number in front of the period is for  hands and the number after the period is the remaining inches.\n15 - This is a correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.0 - Another correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.1 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 1  inch tall\n15.2 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 2  inches tall\n15.3 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 3  inches tall\n15.4 - Wrong! This means that a horse is 15 hands, 4 inches tall. Since  a hand is equal to four inches, this horse is actually 16 hands tall.\n15.5 - Wrong again! Some people incorrectly use the number after the  period to stand for fractions of a hand, but it should stand for inches. So,  some people write \"15.5\" to mean 15 and a half hands, but this should  correctly be written as \"15.2\".\nIf you like, you can add \"hh\" to a measurement, as in \"15.1hh\".  The \"hh\" stands for \"hands high.\"\nHorse Measuring Devices\nThere are measuring devices on the market for horses  that have hand and inches measurements marked on them. Some devices are rigid  poles with short cross bars toward the top that can be raised or lowered to rest on a  horse's withers. These are very handy and give accurate measurements easily.\nAnother common device is a horse height/weight tape , which is a special tape measure  with hands and inches marked on it. These are inexpensive and are accurate if the person doing the measuring  makes sure to run the tape straight up  and down, and to read the measurement at a level angle.\nWhere Did \"Hands\" Come From?\nAs stated above, a horse's height is measured in  hands. The origin of measuring a horse this way is very old, but easy to  understand. In days long ago people did not have the common measuring devices  (like tape measures, etc.) that we do today. To measure a horse, they used what  was handy (no pun intended): Their hands. At various times in history and in  different locales a \"hand\" was defined as the with of a person's hand  using the fingers only, the width of a person's hand using the fingers and the thumb, the  height of a clenched fist, and possibly others. Somewhere along the way, the  measuring unit of a hand was standardized to mean four inches. Though the  origins are ancient, a hand is still the unit of measurement for horses that  modern horse owners use today.\nQuestion:\nHorses are measured in 'hands', what is the equivalent of a hand in inches?\nAnswer:\nfour  distance\nPassage:\nPrivate Walker\nPrivate Joe Walker is a fictional black market spiv (or Wholesales Supplier, as he politely puts it) and Home Guard platoon member portrayed by actor James Beck on the BBC television sitcom Dad's Army. James Beck died suddenly in 1973, and is featured in just under three-quarters of the episodes. Despite this, the character of Walker was possibly one of the most prominent and popular in the show. Following his character's departure (Walker was last mentioned in the episode \"The Recruit\", although he does not appear in this episode) the series attempted to replace him with a war reporter called Private Cheeseman (played by Talfryn Thomas) who had made a previous cameo appearance in My British Buddy.\n\nPersonality\n\nWalker was the second youngest member of the platoon, the youngest being Pike. A pleasant and amiable (if slightly shifty) personality, Walker is nevertheless a constant thorn in Mainwaring's side as he doesn't share his idealism and makes cheeky and witty interruptions during his serious lectures. However, despite this he is good-natured and loyal to his commanding officer and platoon comrades, and is a valuable asset to the platoon, due to his many \"business\" connections and his ability to mysteriously conjure up almost anything that is rationed or no longer in the shops due to the War - and he will also have it in vast supply (for a price). \n\nPrivate Walker also demonstrates keen improvisational skills and cunning; as a result, owing to these attributes and his cheerful willingness to use tactics that Mainwaring might not consider to be 'cricket', he is usually responsible for getting the platoon out of many of the scrapes that they find themselves in. He is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to make a few bob, and can normally be found trying to sell such things as petrol coupons and black market foodstuffs to his platoon comrades, usually at high prices and from dubious sources. His \"business\" activities are not limited to just the members of the platoon, or indeed even to the residents of Walmington-on-Sea, as he has often made reference to acquiring \"essential supplies\" for members of the rival Eastgate platoon and various influential people, military or civilian; at one point, he offers to provide \"a couple of bottles of scotch\" to a high-ranking GHQ officer, when Mainwaring briefly loses his command of the platoon. Indeed, the only time Walker can't find a buyer for his \"essential supplies\" is when the American Army arrives at Walmington-on-Sea (with the comparatively well-off American troops already having plenty of liquor and other items normally provided by Walker).\n\nWalker considers himself a ladies' man, and his recurring girlfriend Shirley (played by Wendy Richard) is seen in several episodes. In the platoon, he mostly associates with Jones, Pike and Frazer. Despite merely being a Private, Walker clearly has some form of influence over the platoon, not least due to his black-market dealings which have got them out of (and into) numerous scrapes. Moreover, when Frazer is temporarily promoted to Captain in If the Cap Fits..., he selects Walker as his Sergeant. Walker has friendly relationships with all the men in the platoon, jokingly referring to the Scottish Frazer as \"Taffy\", and occasionally calling Jones a \"silly old duffer\" when they have the odd disagreement.\n\nHe is supposedly allergic to corned beef, and this is given as the reason why he has not been called up for the regular army, although it is generally assumed that he has found a way to dodge the rules. This allergy was exposed in the episode The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker, which has since been lost from the BBC's archives. He was conscripted, only to be discharged when it was found that corned beef fritters were the only rations left for the soldiers to eat.  Although a superficially implausible explanation for Walker's discharge it is actually possible to have an [http://www.livestrong.com/article/525254-corned-beef-allergy/ allergy to certain types of corned beef] but not beef itself as a result of various antioxidants that may be used in the curing process.\n\nWalker's final appearance was in the episode Things That Go Bump in the Night, where the platoon spent the night in a mysterious house. In fact he is only seen in the location shots, filmed some time before the studio recording. Beck was ill for the recordings of both this episode and the next, The Recruit, in which the story suggested that Walker had \"gone to the smoke\" (a slang term for London) to \"do a deal\". After Beck's death, Walker was never mentioned in the show (though the character survived the war; the very first episode begins with a scene set in 1968, as Mainwaring, now an alderman, launches his \"I'm Backing Britain\" campaign - Walker is seen as one of the town worthies present at the launch).\n \nIn the radio adaptations of the series, Graham Stark stood in until Larry Martyn gave his portrayal of Walker for subsequent shows. In 1976 John Bardon played Walker in the stage production. Scriptwriter Jimmy Perry originally intended to play the part himself, but was advised against it by his co-writer David Croft. Walker was based on a spiv character created and performed by British comedian and actor Arthur English (English was in the controversial episode Absent Friends and starred in Are You Being Served?).\nQuestion:\nWho played Private Joe Walker in Dad\u2019s Army?\nAnswer:\nJimmy Beck\nPassage:\nJenny Pitman\nJenny Pitman (born 11 June 1946ISBN 1-85225-254-5 \"Jenny Pitman, The Autobiography\" ) is a former British racehorse trainer and author. She became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere won the race in 1983. She went on to win a second Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995. Following her retirement from horse training in 1998 she became a writer of novels, principally with a racing theme.\n\nChildhood\n\nPitman was born as Jenny Harvey on her family's farm near Hoby, Leicestershire, one of seven children. She was brought up assisting in manual farm work, where horse powered equipment was a novelty, and learned to ride a pony \"so young that being on horseback seemed as natural as walking\". In 1957 she left the Hoby village school to attend Sarson Secondary Modern Girls' School in Melton Mowbray. She sustained a fractured skull when a showjumping pole fell on her head during a gymkhana at Syston, it was many months before resultant convulsions were diagnosed. At the age of 14, she obtained a weekend and school holiday job at Brooksby Grange horse racing yard.\n\nPitman left school two weeks before her 15th birthday, taking up a position as a stable girl, at Brooksby Grange for a weekly wage of \u00a33\u00a04s\u00a05d. Her first overnight stop was at Manchester where her filly, Star Princess, won the 1962 Diomedes Handicap. Two years later she changed jobs, moving to a stable in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, the first time she had lived away from her Leicestershire home.\n\nAdult life\n\nPitman worked at Bishop's Cleeve for two years. One day there, she was returning from a workout on the local gallops when her horse was spooked by a cyclist travelling around a corner too fast and on the wrong side of the road. The cyclist in question was jockey Richard Pitman. Jenny's initial reaction to Richard was unfavourable, but later, when Richard obtained a job in Lambourn at Fred Winter's training stables 50 mi from Bishop's Cleeve, Jenny was persuaded to apply for a job in Lambourn with Major Champneys at Church Farm Stables. She moved in 1964.\n\nAged 19, she married Richard Pitman. In August 1966, their son Mark Pitman was born and Jenny became a full-time housewife. Son Paul was born in October 1967. In the next winter, missing the world of horses, they bought a 6 acre property with stables and an indoor school in Hinton Parva to provide a service to other trainers for recuperating injured horses. In 'Parva Stud', the family struggled to live in an unheated caravan. By the end of 1968 Pitman had 8 horses at the yard. With Richard's second place prize from the 1969 Grand National, the Pitmans were able to commission a bungalow on the premises to escape the poor condition caravan. In 1969 she employed a 'lad' to assist at the yard, Melvyn Saddler, who became her right-hand man as her success grew.\n\nIn February 1974, Pitman was able to enter a horse she had trained in her first point-to-point race. Ridden by stable lad Bryan Smart, Road Race didn't figure in the race betting, but amazingly managed to pass the favourite after the last fence to win.\n\nIn 1977 Jenny and Richard divorced and Jenny left Wiltshire and moved to Lambourn, Berkshire. She is now married to businessman, David Stait. In 1975 she was successful in getting her first horse training licence and her first winner came in the very same year.\n\nIn 1983 she became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere was the victor.  She was to win one other Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995 although her horse Esha Ness was first past the post in the void National of 1993. \n \nIn 1998 she was awarded the OBE for services to horseracing  and subsequently retired from training racehorses in 1999, handing over the reins to son, Mark. Pitman was the first winner of the Helen Rollason award at the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year Awards.\n\nAlthough still seen at the races, she is now a prolific writer of novels, principally with a racing spin. \n\nA survivor of thyroid cancer, she is a patron of the British Thyroid Foundation.\nQuestion:\nJenny Pitman was the trainer of which 1995 Grand National winning horse?\nAnswer:\nRoyal Athlete\nPassage:\nDunkery Hill\nDunkery Beacon at the summit of Dunkery Hill is the highest point on Exmoor and in Somerset, England. It is also the highest point in southern England outside of Dartmoor.\n\nThe sandstone hill rises to 1705 ft and provides views over the surrounding moorland, the Bristol Channel and hills up to 86 mi away. The site has been visited by humans since the Bronze Age, and contains several burial mounds in the form of cairns and bowl barrows. Sweetworthy on the lower slopes is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures and a deserted medieval settlement. The hill is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and National nature reserve. It was in private ownership until the 20th century, when it was donated to the National Trust by Sir Thomas Acland, Colonel Wiggin and Allan Hughes; a stone cairn was erected at the summit to commemorate the event.\n\nLocation\n\nDunkery is composed of Middle Devonian sedimentary rock, () known as the Hangman Sandstone Formation.  This supports acidic soils. \nThe ridge along the top of the hill is  long.\n\nAt 1705 ft ordnance datum (OD), the mean height above sea level,  Dunkery Beacon is the highest natural point in Somerset,  although the tip of the Mendip TV Mast is higher at  OD. Dunkery is ranked 23rd in the UK in terms of dominance and is a Marilyn, meaning that it is a peak with 150 m or more of relative height. The nearest higher hill is Yes Tor, 37 mi away. John Fry, a character in R. D. Blackmore's 1869 novel Lorna Doone, calls it the \"haighest place of Hexmoor\". \n\nDunkery lies just 4 mi from the Bristol Channel at Porlock. The shortest route of ascent goes from the car park at Dunkery Gate, and is just  long. There are extensive views from the summit, from where the Bristol and English Channel coasts, the Brecon Beacons including Pen Y Fan, Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor, the Severn Bridges and Cleeve Hill 86 mi away in Gloucestershire are visible. \n\nHistory\n\nDunkery Hill was part of the \"Royal Forest of Exmoor\", established by Henry II according to the late 13th-century Hundred Rolls. There has been some debate about the origin of the name \"Dunkery\" and its predecessors \"Duncrey\" and \"Dunnecray\".  Eilert Ekwall suggests that it comes from the Welsh din meaning hillfort and creic or creag meaning rock.  \n\nThere are several Bronze Age burial mounds at or near the summit.  Two of the largest are Joaney How and Robin How, which have been damaged over many years, although plans have been made to restore and protect them.  \"How\" comes from the Norse for burial mound.  Joaney How on the northern slope, is more than 22 m in diameter.   On the southeastern slopes are four more cairns,  and there are a further two round cairns 390 m and 420 m southeast of Rex Stile Head.  In addition to the cairns are barrows, which also date from the Bronze Age. One bowl barrow on the southeastern spur of the Chains is  in diameter.  A circular funerary stone mound 850 m north of Dunkery Bridge, which is a  walk from the summit, dates from the Neolithic or Bronze Age. It is approximately  high and 14 m in diameter.  \n\nSweetworthy, on Dunkery Hill's north-facing slope, is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures;   one has a single rampart and external ditch, enclosing .  The rampart is still visible, and the ditch on the east side is used as a trackway.   There was a defended settlement above the main site.  It is also the site of a deserted medieval settlement, which has been designated an ancient monument.   It has been added to the Heritage at Risk register because of the vulnerability to plant growth. \n\nIn 1918 Sir Thomas Acland leased part of the land.along with a large part of the Holnicote Estate, for 500 years. Dunkery Hill was put up for sale in 1928. Labour Party activist and Member of Parliament Margaret Bondfield asked in the House of Commons if the government was willing to have it designated an ancient monument, to preserve it for future generations. She received the reply that although the government was agreeable to having the hill listed there were no funds available for its purchase;  the beacon and surrounding mounds were subsequently designated an ancient monument.  The beacon itself, and 960 acre of surrounding land, was donated in 1932 by Colonel W.W. Wiggin. A further 945 acre of nearby land was donated in 1934 by Mrs Hughes in memory of her husband Alan Hughes of Lynch Allerford, Minehead. The donations were commemorated in 1935 with an event when a plaque was attached to the summit memorial cairn. Further parts of the Holnicote Estate, which includes other land donated by the Acland family and others, was given in subsequent years.   \n\nEcology\n\nThe site is part of the North Exmoor Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), part of the Dunkery & Horner Woods National Nature Reserve  and part of the Exmoor Coastal Heaths Special Area of Conservation. \n\nThe hill is blanketed in heather, which gives it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, as well as some unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.\nQuestion:\nDunkery Beacon is the highest point in which English National Park?\nAnswer:\nExmoor National Park\nPassage:\nLicence to Kill (soundtrack)\nThe soundtrack to Licence to Kill, the 16th James Bond film of the same name, was released by MCA Records in 1989.\n\nBecause the usual James Bond composer John Barry (who had scored almost every film from From Russia with Love onwards) was not available at the time as he was undergoing throat surgery, the soundtrack's more upbeat and suspenseful score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen.\n\nInitially Eric Clapton and Vic Flick were asked to write and perform the theme song to Licence to Kill. The theme was said to have been a new version based on the James Bond Theme. The guitar riff heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Flick. \n\nThe prospect, however, fell apart and Gladys Knight's song and performance was chosen, later becoming a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. The song was composed by Narada Michael Walden, Jeffrey Cohen and Walter Afanasieff, based on the \"horn line\" from Goldfinger, which required royalty payments to the original writers.  At five-minutes twelve seconds it is the longest Bond theme. The music video of \"Licence to Kill\" was directed by Daniel Kleinman, who later took over the reins of title designer from Maurice Binder for the 1995 Bond film, GoldenEye.\n\nAll the instrumental tracks are amalgams of various sequences and musical cues from the film rather than straight score excerpts. The end credits of the film feature the song \"If You Asked Me To\" sung by Patti LaBelle. Though the song was a top ten R&B charter and a minor pop hit for LaBelle, in 1992, the song was covered by and became a much bigger hit for singer C\u00e9line Dion. The track \"Wedding Party\", used during the wedding of Felix Leiter to Della Churchill, makes reference to the track \"Jump Up\" from the first Bond film, Dr. No.\n\nTrack listing\n\n# \"Licence to Kill\" \u2013 Gladys Knight\n# \"Wedding Party\" \u2013 Ivory\n# \"Dirty Love\" \u2013 Tim Feehan\n# \"Pam\"\n# \"If You Asked Me To\" \u2013 Patti LaBelle\n# \"James & Felix on Their Way to Church\"contains the James Bond Theme, originally composed for the Dr. No soundtrack\n# \"His Funny Valentine\"\n# \"Sanchez Is in the Bahamas/Shark Fishing\"\n# \"Ninja\"\n# \"Licence Revoked\"\nQuestion:\nCan you name the singer of the title track for '1989 - Licence to Kill'?\nAnswer:\nGladys Knight\nPassage:\nHouses of Parliament | Monet Gallery\nHouses of Parliament | Monet Gallery\nMonet \u2022 Paintings \u2022 Houses of Parliament\nHouses of Parliament\nClaude Monet first went to London in 1870 to escape the Franco-Prussian War. While there he would have seen and been inspired by painters like Turner and began to develop his use of bright colors that would become a defining element of Impressionist painting.\nAfter traveling and moving to Giverny, where he would have his famous gardens, Monet returned to London in 1899 and began work on a series of paintings depicting the Palace of Westminster, also called The House of Parliament, or simply Parliament. His Houses of Parliament series contains 19 canvases all exactly the same size and depicting the same scene from the same vantage point.\nStarting in February 1900, Monet began painting a view of Parliament from across the river Thames. From a terrace on the second floor of the St. Thomas Hospital, Monet could see the Houses of Parliament, including Big Ben, sitting on the edge of the river. In each canvas Parliament is on the right, with water to the left and in front and sky above. As in previous works, these paintings are studies in showing the changing landscape. Because his subject, the light, changes so quickly Monet would sketch out the\nbuilding of Parliament before hand and then paint, adding the color and detail, while looking out his terrace over the river.\nIn previous Series paintings, Haystacks and Rouen Cathedral , Monet showed the effect light and the atmosphere has on objects. While the Parliament series has the building, Westminster Palace is so distorted and obscured by the fog and smog it becomes secondary as the subject. For the Parliament series, we are not just seeing the effect of light on objects we see, Monet is showing the effect of light on the atmosphere itself. Even today London is famous for its fog, and in the 1880\u2019s the Fog was at its peak being heavy and frequent. By 1900, the fog had been decreasing, but was still apparent and being thickened by the smog a result of London\u2019s growing industry.\nThroughout the series of paintings Monet shows the river change from blue and green to bright orange and red lit by the afternoon sun. Monet\u2019s brushstrokes create depth and layers within the fog showing the thickness and weight of the atmosphere. In one painting Parlement, coucher du soleil, 1902, the sun is setting behind the clouds creating highlights and shadows high within the sky turning the river into a mirror reflecting Westminster Palace. In another Houses of Parliament, stormy sky, 1904, almost the entire canvas is orange; as the storm, lit by the high sun, hangs over London darkening Parliament. A few of his canvases show the disc of the sun, visible through the fog and reflecting on the water, while others show a dark sky, the sun hidden behind a thick fog.\nMonet made two trips to London to work on the Houses of Parliament series, in 1900 and 1901. While he painted them from the St. Thomas Hospital, he returned to France with canvases and worked on them for the next three years not showing them until 1904. It may be thought by some viewers that their apparent lack of detail and the years spent working on them by memory may result in a different scene than what he saw, but modern researchers have been able to analyze his works showing his accuracy. By tracing known astrological patterns and solar geometry, not only have scholars been able to pinpoint the exact room and terrace he was painting from, they know the precise times.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nKevin Lloyd\nKevin Reardon Lloyd (28 March 1949 \u2013 2 May 1998) was an English actor, best known for portraying DC Alfred \"Tosh\" Lines in Thames Television's The Bill.\n\nBorn in Derby, Lloyd trained at East 15 Acting School in Loughton, Essex. Prior to appearing in The Bill he had already played the high-profile role of nightclub owner, Don Watkins, in the soap opera Coronation Street. He also made appearances in a number of other TV shows, including the first series of Starting Out, Boon, Minder, Dear John, Farrington of the F.O., Dempsey and Makepeace, Z-Cars, Andy Capp, Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Blake's 7 and Casualty. His film credits included roles in Trial by Combat (1976), Britannia Hospital (1982), Don't Open till Christmas (1984) and Link (1986).\n\nLloyd was one of the most popular members of the television show, The Bill. In 1996, the show won the award for \"Best TV Drama\" at the National Television Awards and it was Lloyd who collected it on behalf of the cast and crew. His Welsh-born father, Ellis Aled Lloyd, was himself a police officer who was killed in an accident while answering an emergency call aged 46 in 1970. \n\nA chronic alcoholic, he played \"Tosh\" continuously from 1988 until he was sacked from The Bill in 1998 for his lack of punctuality and failing to learn his lines. Within days, he was admitted to a clinic in Burton upon Trent for detoxification and was administered Antabuse (Disulfiram), but then left the premises to drink alcohol. He returned to the clinic in an intoxicated state, retired to bed, fell asleep, then choked on his vomit. Lloyd died just one week after recording his last scenes for The Bill, and the character of Tosh was still appearing on screen for more than a month after Lloyd's death.\n\nHe had been so popular on The Bill that on 26 February 1992, within four years of joining the show, he was selected as special guest for the TV guest show This Is Your Life. \n\nHe was the brother of ITN reporter Terry Lloyd who was killed in the Iraq War in 2003.   His son, James Lloyd, is an actor who also appeared on The Bill between 2004 and 2006.\nQuestion:\nWhat part did the late Kevin Lloyd play in \u2018The Bill\u2019?\nAnswer:\nAlfred \u2018TOSH\u2019 LINES\nPassage:\nThe Bartender and the Thief\n\"The Bartender and the Thief\" is a 1998 single by Welsh rock band Stereophonics. It was the first single taken from their second album Performance and Cocktails. It was released on 9 November 1998 and reached #3 in the UK charts.\n\nThe song is the second track on the Performance and Cocktails album. A live version from Cardiff Castle is available on CD2 of the single. Another live version from Sheffield Arena is on the \"Moviestar\" single. A bar version of the song is on CD 1 of the \"I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio\" single.\n\nThe music video features the band playing at Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand and is based on the Francis Ford Coppola movie, Apocalypse Now.\n\nThe song, which is one of their heavier tracks, is frequently played amongst their live sets. During live performances, vocalist Kelly Jones has been known to utilise the two bars without vocals before the final chorus to reference the Mot\u00f6rhead song \"Ace of Spades\". The lyrics therefore are \"The ace of spades, the ace of spades. The bartender and the thief were lovers...\"\n\nStrangely, the song's full length intro only featured on the CD1 single (and in the music video), but was edited off the Performance & Cocktails album.\n\nWelsh PDC Darts player Mark Webster uses this track as his entrance music.

In A Collection of English Words not generally used, with their Significations and Original, in two Alphabetical Catalogues, the one of such as are proper to the Northern, the other to the Southern Counties (1691), John Ray (1627-1705) recorded, in North Country Words:\nA Hog; a Sheep of a year old; used also in Northampton and Leicester shires, where they also call it a Hoggrel.\nAnd, in South and East Country Words, he wrote:\nHogs; Young Sheep, Northamptonshire. Used also in the same sense in Yorkshire.\nJohn Ray, however, understood hog as meaning domestic pig in A Collection of English Proverbs (1678):\nNe\u2019re lose a hog for an half-penny-worth of tarr.\nA man may spare in an ill time: as some who will rather die, then [= than] spend ten groats in Physick. Some have it, lose not a sheep, &c. Indeed tarr is more used about sheep then swine.\nThe current form of the proverb is first recorded in English Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases (1869), by William Carew Hazlitt (1834-1913):\nTo spoil the ship for a half-pennyworth of tar.\nHowever, the author adds:\nBut, in Cornwall, I heard a different version, which appeared to me to be more consistent with probability: \u201cDon\u2019t spoil the sheep for a ha\u2019porth of tar;\u201d and this agrees with a third variation: \u201cDon\u2019t spoil the hog for, &c.,\u201d a hog in some counties (Lincolnshire, for instance,) standing for a sheep of a year old. But, as Mr. Dyce (A General Glossary to Shakespeare\u2019s Works, article ship*) observes, the two words, sheep and ship, seem formerly to have been pronounced very much alike.\n(* In fact, this observation appears under sheep: \u201csheep formerly often pronounced (as it still is in certain counties) ship, and even so written: hence the quibbles\u201d)\nIn A Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (1993), B. A. Phythian explains that, because of this similarity in pronunciation,\nnon-countryfolk obviously assumed that the expression referred to a ship, the assumption being reinforced by the reference to tar, which was widely used on wooden ships to coat and preserve the timbers. To complete this transformation of a rustic expression into a nautical-sounding one, the rather extravagant and unconvincing idea of \u2018losing\u2019 an entire ship for the sake of a small economy was changed to \u2018spoiling\u2019.\nQuestion:\n\"What usually completes the phrase \"\"to spoil the ship for a ha'porth of ...\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nTar-based shampoo\nPassage:\nDashiki\nThe dashiki is a colorful garment for men widely worn in West Africa and also worn in other parts of Africa. It covers the top half of the body. It has formal and informal versions and varies from simple draped clothing to fully tailored suits. A common form is a loose-fitting pullover garment, with an ornate V-shaped collar, and tailored and embroidered neck and sleeve lines.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name dashiki is derived from the Hausa word ', which means shirt. It is usually worn with a brimless Kufi cap which is worn in Islamic communities in Africa and the African diaspora, and a pair of pants. In Ghana, the fabric is commonly known by people as \"Angelina\".\n\nHistory in the West \n\nThe dashiki was made popular in the western parts of the world by Oba (Yoruba word for king) Ofuntola Oseijeman Adelabu Adefunmi, who was born Walter Eugene in Detroit, Michigan, USA in 1928. He became interested in African Studies at the age of 16, and traveled to Haiti at the age of 20 in order to be exposed to African religion from indigenous Africans. Soon after, he returned to the U.S. and began a small scale manufacturing business which included African attire, most notably dashikis.\n\nVersions \n\nThe informal version is a traditional print or embroidered dashiki. Three formal versions exist. The first type consists of a dashiki, sokoto (drawstring trousers), and a matching kufi. This style is called a dashiki suit or dashiki trouser set and it is the attire worn by most grooms during wedding ceremonies. The second version consists of an ankle-length shirt, matching kufi, and sokoto and is called a Senegalese kaftan. The third type consists of a dashiki and matching trousers. A flowing gown is worn over these. This type is called a grand boubou or an agbada.\n\nThere are several different styles of dashiki suits available from clothing stores. The type of shirt included in the set determines the name. The traditional dashiki suit includes a thigh-length shirt. The short sleeve, traditional style is preferred by purists. A long dashiki suit includes a shirt that is knee-length or longer. However, if the shirt reaches the ankles, it is a Senegalese kaftan. Finally, the lace dashiki suit includes a shirt made of lace. A hybrid of the dashiki and caftan worn by females is a traditional male dashiki with a western skirt.\n\nWedding colors \n\nWhite is the traditional color for West African weddings.   Most grooms wear white dashiki suits during wedding ceremonies.  Some couples wear non-traditional colours. The most common non-traditional colors are purple and blue.\n* Purple and lavender: the color of African royalty. \n* Blue: blue is the color of love, peace, and harmony.\n\nFuneral colors\n\nBlack and red are the traditional colors of mourning. \n\nDashiki in the United States \n\nThe dashiki found a market in America during the black cultural and political struggles in the 1960s. The dashiki was featured in the movies Uptight (1968), Putney Swope (1969), and the weekly television series Soul Train (1971). Jim Brown, Wilt Chamberlain, Sammy Davis Jr., and Bill Russell were among the well-known African-American athletes and entertainers who wore the dashiki on talk shows. Hippies also adopted dashikis into their wardrobe as a means to express counterculture values.  Former District of Columbia mayor and council member Marion Barry was known for wearing a dashiki leading up to elections.\n\nThe term dashiki began appearing in print at least as early as 1967. Reporting on the 1967 Newark riots in the Amsterdam News on July 22, 1967, George Barner refers to a new African garment called a \"danshiki\". An article by Faith Berry in the New York Times Magazine includes it on July 7, 1968.\n\n\"Dashiki\" formally appeared in the Webster's New World Dictionary, 1st College Edition 1970/72.  It cites J. Benning as having coined the word in 1967.  J. Benning, M. Clarke, H. Davis and W. Smith were founders of New Breed, the first manufacturer of the garment in the United States, Harlem, New York. York Wong joined the company as Financial Vice President in 1971.\n\nDashiki has been found on many musicians mostly the African-American musicians including famous ones like Chris Brown ,  Beyonce, Rihanna, Zendaya, ScHoolboy Q,Jhene Aiko,  Q-Tip and many more\nQuestion:\nWhat item of clothing is a 'Dashiki'?\nAnswer:\nString vest\n\n\nPassage:\nWellington College, Berkshire\nHome - Wellington College\nIn\nThe Master's Welcome\n\"Hard to imagine it done better.

A long dashiki suit includes a shirt that is knee-length or longer. However, if the shirt reaches the ankles, it is a Senegalese kaftan. Finally, the lace dashiki suit includes a shirt made of lace. A hybrid of the dashiki and caftan worn by females is a traditional male dashiki with a western skirt.\n\nWedding colors \n\nWhite is the traditional color for West African weddings.   Most grooms wear white dashiki suits during wedding ceremonies.  Some couples wear non-traditional colours. The most common non-traditional colors are purple and blue.\n* Purple and lavender: the color of African royalty. \n* Blue: blue is the color of love, peace, and harmony.\n\nFuneral colors\n\nBlack and red are the traditional colors of mourning. \n\nDashiki in the United States \n\nThe dashiki found a market in America during the black cultural and political struggles in the 1960s. The dashiki was featured in the movies Uptight (1968), Putney Swope (1969), and the weekly television series Soul Train (1971). Jim Brown, Wilt Chamberlain, Sammy Davis Jr., and Bill Russell were among the well-known African-American athletes and entertainers who wore the dashiki on talk shows. Hippies also adopted dashikis into their wardrobe as a means to express counterculture values.  Former District of Columbia mayor and council member Marion Barry was known for wearing a dashiki leading up to elections.\n\nThe term dashiki began appearing in print at least as early as 1967. Reporting on the 1967 Newark riots in the Amsterdam News on July 22, 1967, George Barner refers to a new African garment called a \"danshiki\". An article by Faith Berry in the New York Times Magazine includes it on July 7, 1968.\n\n\"Dashiki\" formally appeared in the Webster's New World Dictionary, 1st College Edition 1970/72.  It cites J. Benning as having coined the word in 1967.  J. Benning, M. Clarke, H. Davis and W. Smith were founders of New Breed, the first manufacturer of the garment in the United States, Harlem, New York. York Wong joined the company as Financial Vice President in 1971.\n\nDashiki has been found on many musicians mostly the African-American musicians including famous ones like Chris Brown ,  Beyonce, Rihanna, Zendaya, ScHoolboy Q,Jhene Aiko,  Q-Tip and many more\nQuestion:\nWhat item of clothing is a 'Dashiki'?\nAnswer:\nString vest\n", "answers": ["Berkshire, England", "Highway, Berkshire", "Royal Country of Berkshire", "Berkshire", "Royal Berkshire", "County of Berkshire", "Royal County of Berkshire", "County of Berks"], "pred": "In which county is Wellington College?

Competing martial artists generally practice their skills and train for hundreds of hours longer than their matches ever last, and the number of different training modalities necessary to be successful can be overwhelming. Conditioning the martial arts athlete might not be as easy as it seems at first and there are many schools of thought.\n\u00a0\nThe martial arts athlete should be very wise when implementing any strength and conditioning training that does not directly involve enhancing specific combat skills. As a strength and conditioning coach for several MMA fighters, I have always lived by the philosophy that the training I do with these athletes should only enhance all of their other training. Most competitive combat sport athletes train at least twice a day and I have found that too many strength coaches overwork these athletes, as if it was another 10-round sparring session. Or, even worse, coaches implement ineffective conditioning programs that do not benefit the athlete or add to their overall training. I am not here to break down my athletes, or even more importantly, waste their time. I have to give them exactly what they need to complement their skills to be successful in competition.\n\u00a0\nConditioning for the combat athlete is not exactly simple. These athletes need to have a balance between quick, explosive, and repetitive strength production, as well as have the endurance capacity to maintain these qualities over a match lasting anywhere from 5 to 25 minutes. Some coaches like implementing long runs. Though these runs might be effective for a completely unconditioned athlete who needs to create a foundation, if used too much you will have a weak and non-explosive athlete. On the other hand, if you solely concentrate on explosive work, such as Olympic lifting, you have an explosive athlete with little stamina, who better connect with the first couple of punches or else he/she is going to gas out and become a human punching bag for the opponent.\n\u00a0\nSo, it sounds like an impossible task to train for both explosive strength and endurance and to do it without running your athlete to the ground. It can be accomplished, though, and one of the best tools I have found for the job is using the kettlebell for training circuits. By manipulating different weights, using dynamics exercises, and varying time intervals, kettlebells allow the combat athlete to be strong, explosive, and have a high level of endurance to maintain those qualities over the course of their match.\n\u00a0\nIn this article I am going to show you how I use kettlebell circuits with my athletes. You do not need to train or even be a combat athlete to enjoy the benefits of these circuits. All you need is a kettlebell or two and the desire to get better.\n\u00a0\nWhen I create and customize kettlebell circuits for combat athletes there are a few concepts I consider when incorporating them into the athlete\u2019s overall program:\n\u00a0\nKettlebell exercises should be multi-joint movements that enhance athletic movements, like squats, lunges, and swings.\nCircuit times should be around a 2:1 work to rest ratio. I prefer 20-60 seconds of work and 10-30 seconds of rest. I also like to make the total circuit times replicate the rounds for their competition. For example, if a round in competition is 3 minutes then the circuit total time should be around 3 minutes of work as well.\nEach exercise should be safe to perform at a continuous and fast rate.\nThe exercise selection should be balanced and organized properly. You want to incorporate double joint movements (squats, deadlifts, 2-arm swings) with unilateral (single-sided) movements as well (lunges, Romanian deadlifts, and 1-arm swings).\n\u00a0\nBelow are some examples of strength and conditioning circuits I use to get my athletes in shape and performing at their best.\nQuestion:\nLasting anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes, what are the intervals that make up a boxing match called?\nAnswer:\nRounded\nPassage:\nChild Is Father of the Man\n\"Child Is Father of the Man\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks. Originally recorded by the American rock band the Beach Boys, it was to be included on their projected album Smile. Due to the project's abandonment, the intended nature of the piece is mostly unknown. The result left is a nearly instrumental piece with the words \"child\" and \"father of the man\" sung over the chorus. Biographer Jon Stebbins describes the track: \"a brooding and expansive aura, with a plaintive harmonica line not dissimilar to those heard on Ennio Morricone spaghetti western soundtracks.\" \n\nIn 2004, Wilson completed the track for his album Brian Wilson Presents Smile. This rerecorded version incorporated an additional set of lyrics penned by Parks. In 2011, the Beach Boys' version was released for the first time as part of The Smile Sessions box set.\n\nComposition\n\n\"Child is father of the man\" is an idiom originating from the poem \"My Heart Leaps Up\" by William Wordsworth. In a 1966 interview, Wilson mistakenly attributed it to Karl Menninger, and added that the saying had fascinated him.  There exist many different interpretations of the phrase, the most popular of which is man being the product of habits and behavior developed in youth. According to collaborator Van Dyke Parks, he brought up the idiom to Wilson.\n\nRecording\n\nSeveral sections of the song were recorded, but aside from a group piano demo, only one variation of the chorus's backing track was overdubbed with vocals sung in elaborate musical rounds. The structure was never finalized. According to The Smile Sessions compiler Mark Linett, \"When he's not singing, you can hear faint background vocal parts that no longer exist on the multitrack. They must have been in his headphones, and were picked up by the vocal mic. It could be that Brian decided he didn't need them, or that he was going to re-record them, but never did. You hear this sort of stuff throughout the tapes.\"  The song was worked on between October and December 1966. After one more revisit in April 1967, the track was abandoned forever by the group.\n\nDecades later in both The Smile Sessions and Brian Wilson Presents Smile, the song was included as the third track of the second movement. \"Child Is Father of the Man\" precedes \"Surf's Up\" and follows \"Look (Song for Children)\". On The Smile Sessions, some vocals from \"Surf's Up\" were digitally inserted into the instrumental track. When rerecorded by Wilson in 2004, he sang newly written lyrics by Parks (Easy, my child / It's just enough to believe / Out of the wild / into what you can conceive / You'll achieve).   \n\nLegacy\n\nThe song's chorus was later rewritten and rerecorded as the chorus for \"Little Bird\", a song on the band's 1968 Friends album released as a single.  It was then quoted within the closing section of \"Surf's Up\", which ended up appearing on their 1971 album of the same name.\nPersonnel\n\n;The Beach Boys\n* Carl Wilson \u2013 vocals (The Smile Sessions)\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the line 'The Child is Father of the Man'?\nAnswer:\nWORDSWORTH\nPassage:\nPeter Andre\nPeter Andre (born Peter James Andrea; 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London) is an English-Australian singer, songwriter, businessman, presenter and television personality of Greek Cypriot descent.\n\nHe gained popularity as a singer, best known for his successful singles \"Mysterious Girl\" and \"Flava\". He is also known for appearing on the third series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, and the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing, in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara.\n\nDuring his time on I'm A Celebrity, Andre developed an on-screen romantic relationship with fellow contestant, Katie Price.

During this time, Andre attended Benowa State High School on the Gold Coast. He was raised as a Jehovah's Witness, but is now lapsed.  \n\nTelevision\n\nDuring their marriage, Andre and Katie Price launched the Katie & Peter franchise on ITV2 which documented their life together.

They have two children together: son Junior Savva, born on 13 June 2005, and daughter Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther, born on 29 June 2007.  While married to Price, Andre was stepfather to her son Harvey, a blind and autistic child from Price's earlier relationship with football player Dwight Yorke. \n\nIn May 2009, it was announced that Andr\u00e9 and Price had separated after 3\u00bd years of marriage.  They were officially divorced on 8 September 2009. \n\nSince July 2012, Andre has been in a relationship with medical student Emily MacDonagh, who is 16 years his junior.

These athletes need to have a balance between quick, explosive, and repetitive strength production, as well as have the endurance capacity to maintain these qualities over a match lasting anywhere from 5 to 25 minutes. Some coaches like implementing long runs. Though these runs might be effective for a completely unconditioned athlete who needs to create a foundation, if used too much you will have a weak and non-explosive athlete. On the other hand, if you solely concentrate on explosive work, such as Olympic lifting, you have an explosive athlete with little stamina, who better connect with the first couple of punches or else he/she is going to gas out and become a human punching bag for the opponent.\n\u00a0\nSo, it sounds like an impossible task to train for both explosive strength and endurance and to do it without running your athlete to the ground. It can be accomplished, though, and one of the best tools I have found for the job is using the kettlebell for training circuits. By manipulating different weights, using dynamics exercises, and varying time intervals, kettlebells allow the combat athlete to be strong, explosive, and have a high level of endurance to maintain those qualities over the course of their match.\n\u00a0\nIn this article I am going to show you how I use kettlebell circuits with my athletes. You do not need to train or even be a combat athlete to enjoy the benefits of these circuits. All you need is a kettlebell or two and the desire to get better.\n\u00a0\nWhen I create and customize kettlebell circuits for combat athletes there are a few concepts I consider when incorporating them into the athlete\u2019s overall program:\n\u00a0\nKettlebell exercises should be multi-joint movements that enhance athletic movements, like squats, lunges, and swings.\nCircuit times should be around a 2:1 work to rest ratio. I prefer 20-60 seconds of work and 10-30 seconds of rest. I also like to make the total circuit times replicate the rounds for their competition. For example, if a round in competition is 3 minutes then the circuit total time should be around 3 minutes of work as well.\nEach exercise should be safe to perform at a continuous and fast rate.\nThe exercise selection should be balanced and organized properly. You want to incorporate double joint movements (squats, deadlifts, 2-arm swings) with unilateral (single-sided) movements as well (lunges, Romanian deadlifts, and 1-arm swings).\n\u00a0\nBelow are some examples of strength and conditioning circuits I use to get my athletes in shape and performing at their best.\nQuestion:\nLasting anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes, what are the intervals that make up a boxing match called?\nAnswer:\nRounded\nPassage:\nChild Is Father of the Man\n\"Child Is Father of the Man\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks. Originally recorded by the American rock band the Beach Boys, it was to be included on their projected album Smile. Due to the project's abandonment, the intended nature of the piece is mostly unknown. The result left is a nearly instrumental piece with the words \"child\" and \"father of the man\" sung over the chorus. Biographer Jon Stebbins describes the track: \"a brooding and expansive aura, with a plaintive harmonica line not dissimilar to those heard on Ennio Morricone spaghetti western soundtracks.\" \n\nIn 2004, Wilson completed the track for his album Brian Wilson Presents Smile. This rerecorded version incorporated an additional set of lyrics penned by Parks. In 2011, the Beach Boys' version was released for the first time as part of The Smile Sessions box set.\n\nComposition\n\n\"Child is father of the man\" is an idiom originating from the poem \"My Heart Leaps Up\" by William Wordsworth. In a 1966 interview, Wilson mistakenly attributed it to Karl Menninger, and added that the saying had fascinated him.  There exist many different interpretations of the phrase, the most popular of which is man being the product of habits and behavior developed in youth. According to collaborator Van Dyke Parks, he brought up the idiom to Wilson.\n\nRecording\n\nSeveral sections of the song were recorded, but aside from a group piano demo, only one variation of the chorus's backing track was overdubbed with vocals sung in elaborate musical rounds. The structure was never finalized. According to The Smile Sessions compiler Mark Linett, \"When he's not singing, you can hear faint background vocal parts that no longer exist on the multitrack. They must have been in his headphones, and were picked up by the vocal mic. It could be that Brian decided he didn't need them, or that he was going to re-record them, but never did. You hear this sort of stuff throughout the tapes.\"  The song was worked on between October and December 1966. After one more revisit in April 1967, the track was abandoned forever by the group.\n\nDecades later in both The Smile Sessions and Brian Wilson Presents Smile, the song was included as the third track of the second movement. \"Child Is Father of the Man\" precedes \"Surf's Up\" and follows \"Look (Song for Children)\". On The Smile Sessions, some vocals from \"Surf's Up\" were digitally inserted into the instrumental track. When rerecorded by Wilson in 2004, he sang newly written lyrics by Parks (Easy, my child / It's just enough to believe / Out of the wild / into what you can conceive / You'll achieve).   \n\nLegacy\n\nThe song's chorus was later rewritten and rerecorded as the chorus for \"Little Bird\", a song on the band's 1968 Friends album released as a single.  It was then quoted within the closing section of \"Surf's Up\", which ended up appearing on their 1971 album of the same name.\nPersonnel\n\n;The Beach Boys\n* Carl Wilson \u2013 vocals (The Smile Sessions)\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the line 'The Child is Father of the Man'?\nAnswer:\nWORDSWORTH\nPassage:\nPeter Andre\nPeter Andre (born Peter James Andrea; 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London) is an English-Australian singer, songwriter, businessman, presenter and television personality of Greek Cypriot descent.\n\nHe gained popularity as a singer, best known for his successful singles \"Mysterious Girl\" and \"Flava\". He is also known for appearing on the third series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, and the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing, in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara.\n\nDuring his time on I'm A Celebrity, Andre developed an on-screen romantic relationship with fellow contestant, Katie Price. Andre and Price got married two years after the show's finale; they had two children, and released the 2006 album A Whole New World together, before divorcing in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Andre released the album Revelation with the single \"Behind Closed Doors\", which reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. He followed it up with his sixth studio album Accelerate in 2010.\n\nEarly life\n\nPeter Andre was born on 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London. The family lived on the Gold Coast in Queensland during Andre's teenage years. In 1989, 16-year-old Andre became a contestant on the show New Faces, on which he was offered a recording contract for $146,000. During this time, Andre attended Benowa State High School on the Gold Coast. He was raised as a Jehovah's Witness, but is now lapsed.  \n\nTelevision\n\nDuring their marriage, Andre and Katie Price launched the Katie & Peter franchise on ITV2 which documented their life together. The franchise included several fly-on-the-wall reality series which comprised When Jordan Met Peter, Jordan & Peter: Laid Bare and Jordan & Peter: Marriage and Mayhem (2004\u201305); Katie & Peter: The Next Chapter, Katie & Peter: The Baby Diaries and Katie & Peter: Unleashed (2007); Katie & Peter: Down Under; and Katie & Peter: African Adventures (2008); and Katie & Peter: Stateside in 2009. Their 2009 separation resulted in their individual shows being recorded: Peter Andre: The Next Chapter continued on ITV2 until 2011, followed by Peter Andre: Here 2 Help (2011) and Peter Andre: My Life (2011\u201313).\n\nIn July 2010, Andre and Jason Manford were team captains on the ITV series Odd One In.\n\nIn 2013, Andre was a guest judge on the ITV entertainment series Your Face Sounds Familiar.\n\nIn 2013, he guest-presented five episodes of Sunday Scoop on ITV. Since 11 November 2013, Andre has presented 60 Minute Makeover, which has been re-branded as Peter Andre's 60 Minute Makeover.\n\nIn 2014, Andre released the song \"Kid\" for the film Mr. Peabody & Sherman which is the lead single from his album Big Night. \n\nOn 8 October 2014, Andre co-hosted the ITVBe opener with Jamelia.  In 2014, Andre became the new face to feature in supermarket Iceland's television commercials.\n\nAndre is currently starring in the ITV weekly show Give a Pet a Home which works alongside the RSPCA in Birmingham. \nIn August 2015, he was announced as a contestant for the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing which began in September 2015 in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara. They went out just before the quarter final; on week 10, and therefore finished seventh place.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAndre began dating glamour model Katie Price after they met on reality show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in early 2004. The couple got engaged secretly in May of the same year but it wasn't announced publicly until months later. Andre married Price on 10 September 2005 in Highclere Castle, Hampshire. They have two children together: son Junior Savva, born on 13 June 2005, and daughter Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther, born on 29 June 2007.  While married to Price, Andre was stepfather to her son Harvey, a blind and autistic child from Price's earlier relationship with football player Dwight Yorke. \n\nIn May 2009, it was announced that Andr\u00e9 and Price had separated after 3\u00bd years of marriage.  They were officially divorced on 8 September 2009. \n\nSince July 2012, Andre has been in a relationship with medical student Emily MacDonagh, who is 16 years his junior.  MacDonagh gave birth to Andre's third child, a girl named Amelia, on 7 January 2014.  Andre and MacDonagh married on 11 July 2015 in Exeter at Mamhead House.\nOn 26 May 2016, Andre announced that his wife MacDonagh is pregnant with the second child for the couple.   \n\nDiscography\n\n* Peter Andre (1993)\n* Natural (1996)\n* Time (1997)\n* The Long Road Back (2004)\n* A Whole New World (with Katie Price) (2006)\n* Revelation (2009)\n* Unconditional: Love Songs (2010)\n* Accelerate (2010)\n* Angels & Demons (2012)\n* Big Night (2014)\n* Come Fly with Me (2015)\n* White Christmas (2015)\n\nFilmography\n\nTelevision\n\n*I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nClun Forest\nClun Forest is a remote, rural area of open pastures, moorland and mixed deciduous/coniferous woodland in the southwest part of the English county of Shropshire and also just over the border into Powys, Wales.\n\nIt was once a large forest covering an area that stretched from Ludlow up the Clun Valley. It now is only forested in some wooded areas, such as Radnor Wood, though a fairly large area of forest exists on the Wales\u2013England border north of Anchor (the planted Ceri Forest).\n\nThe ancient Offa's Dyke runs north-south through the area (and can be walked by the Offa's Dyke Path).\n\nIt is a deanery of the Church of England's Diocese of Hereford. \n\nA Shropshire Lad \n\nA. E. Housman wrote as part of his series of poems A Shropshire Lad:\n\n    \"In valleys of springs of rivers      \n       By Ony and Teme and Clun,          \n    The country for easy livers,          \n       The quietest under the sun...\n\n    'Tis a long way further than Knighton,\n       A quieter place than Clun,         \n    Where doomsday may thunder and lighten\n       And little 'twill matter to one.\"\nQuestion:\nClun Forest lies in which English county?\nAnswer:\nSalopia\nPassage:\nTongue and groove\nA strong joint, the tongue and groove joint is widely used for re-entrant angles. The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded.  In expensive cabinet work, glued dovetail and multiple tongue and groove are used.\n\nTongue and groove is a method of fitting similar objects together, edge to edge, used mainly with wood, in flooring, parquetry, panelling, and similar constructions. Tongue and groove joints allow two flat pieces to be joined strongly together to make a single flat surface. Before plywood became common, tongue and groove boards were also used for sheathing buildings and to construct concrete formwork.\n\nEach piece has a slot (the groove) cut all along one edge, and a thin, deep ridge (the tongue) on the opposite edge. The tongue projects a little less than the depth of the groove. Two or more pieces thus fit together closely. The joint is not normally glued, as shrinkage would then pull the tongue off.\n\nIn another assembly method, the pieces are end-matched. This method eliminates the need for mitre joints, face nailing, and the use of joints on 16 inch or 24 inch centres of conventional framing.\n\nFor many uses, tongue and groove boards have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of plywood and later composite wood boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality.  Plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for sub-floors used in platform framing is often supplied with tongue and groove edges.\n\nWhen joining thicker materials, several tongue and groove joints may be used one above the other.\n\nMethods\n\nOne of the following woodworking tools may be used to produce the tongue and groove:\n* A four- or six-head moulder (for large quantities)\n* A wood shaper (spindle moulder)\n* A circular saw bench\n* Suitable hand planes: a plough plane for the groove and a tongue plane for the tongue, or a combination plane\n* A spindle router\n\nTongue-in-groove\n\nTongue-in-groove is similar to tongue and groove, but instead of the tongue forming part of one of the edges, it is a separate, loose piece that fits between two identically grooved edges. The tongue may or may not be of the same material as the grooved pieces joined by the tongue. For example, plywood flooring is commonly grooved at the edges, and plastic tongues are used to form the joint.\nQuestion:\nA tongue and groove joint is used when working with what material?\nAnswer:\nDiffuse-porous wood\nPassage:\nSenegal\nSenegal (;   ), officially the Republic of Senegal (), is a country located in West Africa. Senegal is bordered by the North African country of Mauritania in the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast, and Guinea-Bissau to the southwest. Senegal further borders the country of The Gambia, a sovereign enclave occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the Gambia river, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with the country of Cape Verde. Senegal's economical and political capital is Dakar. It is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia,  and owes its name to the Senegal River, which borders it to the east and north. The name \"Senegal\" comes from the Wolof \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"Our Boat.\" Senegal covers a land area of almost 197000 km2}} and has an estimated population of about 13 million. The climate is Sahelian, but there is a rainy season.\n\nCultures and influences \n\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since the Prehistory. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the Jolof Empire. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, phosphate mining, fertilizer production, petroleum refining, construction materials, ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including peanuts, sugarcane, cotton, green beans, tomatoes, melons, and mangoes.Ndiaye, Mbalo.

Like the advertising posters which came before them, posters from the First World War were designed to motivate the viewer to enlist in the army, or to buy a war bond.\u00a0 They also had a secondary imperative: to inspire the viewer.\u00a0 In fact, in the United States, posters were part of a campaign of salesmanship to get the American public behind the war.\u00a0 American Posters used figures like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and Lady Liberty allegorically.\u00a0 French Bond Posters used Marianne.\nSilver coin featuring Marianne\nMarianne is the personification of the Republique Francaise and a symbol of liberty and freedom.\u00a0 Images of Marianne first appear in 1775 and depict her standing, young and determined, sometimes bare breasted as she leads soldiers into battle.\u00a0 Her image is allegorical, and is inspired by another allegorical figure, that of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and war.\nThe figure was used on the French postage stamp in 1849, and also on the franc.\u00a0 Today she appears on the French Euro coin.\u00a0 We encounter Marianne occasionally in the advertising poster.\nAdvertising poster for Saponite Laundry Soap, featuring Marianne berating a seated Napoleon\nShe is, however, best enjoyed in the poster in French World War One Bond and Reconstruction posters.\nM.

The intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian (zero degrees latitude and longitude) is in the gulf.\n\nAmong the many rivers that drain into the Gulf of Guinea are the Niger and the Volta. The coastline on the gulf includes the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny.\n\nThe Niger River in particular deposited organic sediments out to sea over millions of years which became crude oil. The Gulf of Guinea region, along with the Congo River delta and Angola further south, are expected to provide around a quarter of the United States' oil imports by 2015. This region is now regarded as one of the world's top oil and gas exploration hotspots.\n\nName\n\nThe origin of the name Guinea is thought to be an area in the region, although the specifics are disputed. Bovill (1995) gives a thorough description: \n\nThe name Guinea is usually said to have been a corrupt form of the name Ghana, picked up by the Portuguese in the Maghrib. The present writer finds this unacceptable. The name Guinea has been in use both in the Maghrib and in Europe long before Prince Henry's time. For example, on a map dated about 1320 by the Genoese cartographer Giovanni di Carignano, who got his information about Africa from a fellow-countryman in Sijilmas [ancient trading city in North Africa], we find Gunuia, and in the Catalan atlas of 1375 as Ginyia. A passage in Leo [Africanus] (vol. III, 822) points to Guinea having been a corrupt form of Jenne [2,000-year-old city in central Mali on Niger river], less famous than Ghana but nevertheless for many centuries famed in the Maghrib as a great market and a seat of learning. The relevant passage reads: \"The Kingdom of Ghinea . . . called by the merchants of our nation Gheneoa, by the natural inhabitants thereof Genni and by the Portugals and other people of Europe Ghinea.\" But it seems more probable that Guinea derives from aguinaou, the Berber for Negro. Marrakech [city in southeastern Morocco] has a gate, built in the twelfth century, called the Bab Aguinaou, the Gate of the Negro (Delafosse, Haut-S\u00e9n\u00e9gal-Niger, II, 277-278). The modern application of the name Guinea to the coast dates only from 1481. In that year the Portuguese built a fort, S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina (modern day Elmina), on the Gold Coast region, and their king, John II, was permitted by the Pope [Sixtus II or Innocent VIII] to style himself Lord of Guinea, a title that survived until the recent extinction of the monarchy.\n\nThe name \"Guinea\" was also applied to south coast of West Africa, north of the Gulf of Guinea, which became known as \"Upper Guinea\", and the west coast of Southern Africa, to the east, which became known as \"Lower Guinea.\" The name \"Guinea\" is still attached to the names of three countries in Africa: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea, as well as New Guinea in Melanesia.\n\nGeography\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southwest extent of the Gulf of Guinea as \"A line running Southeastward from Cape Three Points in Western region Ghana () to Cape Lopez in Gabon ()\". \n\nIslands in the Gulf of Guinea\n\nThe Gulf of Guinea contains a number of islands, the largest of which are in a southwest-northeast chain, forming part of the Cameroon line of volcanoes.\n\nAnnob\u00f3n\n\nAnnob\u00f3n, also known as Pagalu or Pigalu, is an island that is part of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nBobowasi Island\n\nBobowasi Island is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Western region Ghana.\n\nBioko\n\nBioko is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nCorisco\n\nCorisco is an island belonging to Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThe Elobeys\n\nElobey Grande and Elobey Chico are two small islands belonging to Equatorial Guinea.\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (officially the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe) is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea that became independent from Portugal in 1975. It is located off the western equatorial coast of Africa and consists of two islands, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. They are located about 140 km apart and about 250 and, respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon. Both islands are part of an extinct volcanic mountain range. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, the sizeable southern island, is situated just north of the Equator.\nQuestion:\nWhich major river empties into the Gulf of Guinea?\nAnswer:\nNiger Republic\nPassage:\nMar Chiquita Lake (C\u00f3rdoba)\nMar Chiquita (in Spanish literally \"Little Sea\") or Mar de Ansenuza is an endorheic salt lake located in the northeast of the province of C\u00f3rdoba, in central Argentina. The northeast corner of the lake also extends into southeastern Santiago del Estero Province. It is the largest of the naturally occurring saline lakes in Argentina. The lake is located in parts of five departments in the two provinces.\n\nThe lake occupies the southern part of a depression that measures about 50 miles/80\u00a0km (north\u2013south) by 28 miles/45\u00a0km (east\u2013west). Its surface area varies considerably, given its shallow depth (about 10 m), and ranges between 2000 and 6000\u00a0km\u00b2 (1242 and 3728\u00a0mi\u00b2).\n\nMar Chiquita is fed primarily by the saline waters of the Dulce River, coming from Santiago del Estero in the north after being joined by the Saladillo River. The lands around the lower course of the Dulce and Mar Chiquita are wetlands, populated by a large biodiversity (especially aquatic birds). From the southwest the lake receives the flow of the Primero/Suqu\u00eda and the Segundo/Xanaes rivers, as well as several streams; these inflows vary greatly from dry to rainy seasons. The salinity of Mar Chiquita is quite variable, with measured extremes ranging from 250 g/l in times of low water levels to around 40 g/l in very humid years, such as in the decade following 1977, when record rainfall flooded much of Miramar, C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nThere are several islands in the lake, the most important one being the M\u00e9dano Island. Mar Chiquita is slowly diminishing in volume due to increased evaporation and elevation of its bottom, and is ultimately bound to turn into a salt flat. The lake was formerly home to a growing tourism industry, and was the site of the Gran Hotel Vienna, a luxurious, lakefront establishment which functioned from 1945 to 1980, and has been the center of numerous mysteries and controversies.\nQuestion:\nMar Chiquita (Cordoba) is the largest natural salt lake in which South American country?\nAnswer:\nArxintina\nPassage:\nFanta\nFanta is a global brand of fruit-flavored carbonated soft drinks created by The Coca-Cola Company. There are over 100 flavors worldwide. The drink originated in Nazi Germany under trade embargo for Coca-Cola ingredients in 1940.\n\nHistory \n\nFanta originated as a result of difficulties importing Coca-Cola syrup into Nazi Germany during World War II due to a trade embargo. To circumvent this, Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola Deutschland (Coca-Cola GmbH) during the Second World War, decided to create a new product for the German market, using only ingredients available in Germany at the time, including whey and apple pomace\u00a0\u2013 the \"leftovers of leftovers\", as Keith later recalled.  The name was the result of a brief brainstorming session, which started with Keith's exhorting his team to \"use their imagination\" (Fantasie in German), to which one of his salesmen, Joe Knipp, immediately retorted \"Fanta!\"\n\nThe plant was effectively cut off from Coca-Cola headquarters during the war. After the war, the Coca-Cola corporation regained control of the plant, formula and the trademarks to the new Fanta product\u2014as well as the plant profits made during the war.\n\nFanta was discontinued when the parent company was reunited with the German branch.  Following the launch of several drinks by the Pepsi corporation in the 1950s, Coca-Cola competed by relaunching Fanta in 1955.  The drink was heavily marketed in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. \n\nMarketing \n\nUnited States \n\nFanta is known for its upbeat advertising; in the United States, it showcases The Fantanas, a group of young female models, each of whom promotes an individual Fanta flavor. For the re-introduction of Fanta in the United States, Coca-Cola worked with the ad agency Ogilvy (NYC) in 2001. After a brainstorming session, the Ogilvy creative team of Andrea Scaglione, Andrew Ladden and Bill Davaris, created the tagline \"Wanta Fanta!\" which became the jingle for the Fantanas in the broadcast campaign. The campaign lasted from summer 2001, in the form of a successful trial run, to October 1, 2006. Three years later, in June 2009, Fanta re-launched the campaign. They also held a talent search to find the pineapple Fantana, and, in September selected Shakira Barrera to become the fourth Fantana.  After Barrera won the search, she spent a year at her post, with the latter six months as an actual Fantana called Lily.\n\nInternational availability \n\nThere are over 90 different flavors worldwide. In Serbia, Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and some other countries, there is \"Fanta Shokata\" (a wordplay between \"soc\" -elderberry in Romanian- and \"shock\") based on an elderflower blossom extract drink, traditional in Romania (where it is called Socat\u0103), Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and other Balkan countries.\n\nOrange Fanta is also available in Canada; however, the formula for Canada's Orange variant differs from its American and German/European counterparts, notably in that the German contains orange juice,  the Canadian contains tangerine juice  and the American contains neither.  The other variants available in Canada are Grape and Cream Soda, both made with real grapes. \n\nPrimary competitors to Fanta have included Tango, Mirinda, Slice, Sumol, Crush, Tropicana Twister and Orangina. Fanta was the second drink to be produced by Coca-Cola, after the original Coca-Cola.\n\nInternational popularity \n\n*In Australia, there are Fanta Labs in many shopping malls. Fanta Lab provides 2 identical \"Labs\" where there is a set of water filter cups to the side and a touch screen, which shows the four available Australian flavors, Mango-Passionfruit, Orange, Grape, and Raspberry, and can choose 4 flavors to be mixed. Therefore, can mix 2 flavors twice, 3 flavors, 4 flavors, or just get a free cup of original Fanta.\n* In Japan, the market often issues seasonal rare flavours like yuzu.\n* In Greece you can find a non-carbonated version of the original Orange Fanta, called Fanta Blue\n\nControversy \n\nA 2005 British television advertisement for Fanta Z showed a couple enjoying a picnic on a beach and drinking from their cans of Fanta Light, but then calmly spitting the drink out. Others were also shown spitting the drink out in similar ways. The viewers complained that the ad condoned spitting and that children were reported to have copied the ad. A head teacher said that children in the playground had mimicked the commercial. The majority of complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the images were disgusting and thought it was inappropriate because spitting posed a health risk. The ad became restricted to the post-9pm broadcasts. The ASA agreed that viewers would not want children to see something perceived as anti-social, but did not consider that the images showing people spitting would cause widespread offense or pose a significant health risk. \n\n75th anniversary advertisement \n\nIn February 2015, a 75th anniversary version of Fanta was released in Germany. Packaged in glass bottles evoking the original design and with an authentic original war-time flavor including 30% whey and pomace, it is described on the packaging as \"less sweet\" and a German original. An associated television ad referenced the history of the drink and said the Coca-Cola company wanted to bring back \"the feeling of the Good Old Times\" which was interpreted by many to mean Nazi rule. The ad was subsequently replaced.\nQuestion:\nFanta Four are one of what country's top hip hop bands?\nAnswer:\nUnited States of Germany\nPassage:\nCyclades\nThe Cyclades (; ,) are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece. They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean archipelago. The name refers to the islands around (\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2) the sacred island of Delos. The Cyclades is where the native Greek breed of cat (the Aegean cat) originated.\n\nHistory\n\nThe significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age (\"Minoan\") culture arose in Crete, to the south: these figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.\n\nA distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer wheat and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Saliagos and Kephala (on Keos) with signs of copper-working, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.\n\nArchaeology\n\nThe first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898\u20131899 and coined the term \"Cycladic civilization\". Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by Jean Arp or Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these Cycladic figurines has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic frying pans. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from Asia Minor c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.\u00a0 3300 \u2013 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is called Helladic culture.\n\nIn recent decades the Cyclades islands have become popular with European and other tourists, and as a result there have been problems with erosion, pollution, and water shortages.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being Amorgos, Anafi, Andros, Antiparos, Delos, Eschati, Ios, Kea, Kimolos, Kythnos, Milos, Mykonos, Naxos, Paros, Folegandros, Serifos, Sifnos, Sikinos, Syros, Tinos, and Thira or Santor\u00edni. The name \"Cyclades\" refers to the islands forming a circle (\"circular islands\") around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.\n\nErmoupolis, on Syros, is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.\n\nThe islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two volcanic islands, Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes wine, fruit, wheat, olive oil, and tobacco.  Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather.\n\nThe Cyclades are bounded to the south by the Sea of Crete. \n\nAdministration\n\nThe Cyclades Prefecture () was one of the prefectures of Greece. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine regional units of the South Aegean region:\n* Andros\n* Kea-Kythnos\n* Milos\n* Mykonos\n* Naxos\n* Paros\n* Santorini\n* Syros\n* Tinos\n\nMunicipalities and communities\n\nThe prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well. \n \n\nProvinces\n\n* Province of Amorgos: Amorgos\n* Province of Andros: Andros\n* Province of Kea: Ioulis\n* Province of Milos: Milos\n* Province of Naxos: Naxos\n* Province of Paros: Paroikia\n* Province of Syros: Ermoupoli\n* Province of Tinos: Tinos\n* Province of Thera: Thera\n\nNote: Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.\n\nCuisine\n\nLocal specialities of the Cyclades include:\n\n* Brantada\n* Fava Santorinis\n* Fourtalia (Andros)\n* Kalasouna (Naxos)\n* Kalogeros (Naxos)\n* Kakavia (soup)\n* Ladopita\n* Louza, similar to the Cypriot lountza\n* Mastelo (Sifnos)\n* Strapatsada\n* Lazarakia (dessert)\n* Melopita (dessert)\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephone\n\n* 22810: Syros, including Kythnos, Serifos and Syros islands\n* 22820: Andros\n* 22830: Tinos\n* 22840: Paros and Sifnos islands\n* 22850: Amorgos and Naxos islands\n* 22860: Folegandros, Ios, Santorini and Sikinos islands\n* 22870: Kimolos and Milos\n* 22880: Kea Island\n* 22890: Mykonos\nQuestion:\nThe Cyclades are an eastern island group of which nation?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nSpinach - Produce Depot\n\u2022 Excellent source of vitamin K.\n\u2022 Great source of Vitamin A\n\u2022 Good source of manganese, folate, and vitamin C\n\u2022 Source of Iron, Magnesium and Potassium\nIn animal studies, researchers have found that spinach may help protect the brain from oxidative stress and may reduce the effects of age-related related declines in brain function. Research indicates that eating a spinach rich diet significantly improved learning capacity and motor skills in adults.\nChoosing & Storing:\nChoose spinach that has vibrant deep green leaves and stems with no signs of yellowing. The leaves should look fresh and tender, and not be wilted or bruised. Store fresh spinach loosely packed in a plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper where it will keep fresh for about five days. Do not wash it before storing as the moisture will cause it to spoil. Avoid storing cooked spinach as it will not keep very well.\n\u00a0\nTips for Preparing Spinach:\u00a0\nSpinach should be washed very well since the leaves and stems tend to collect sand and soil. Before washing, trim off the roots and separate the leaves. Cut away any overly thick stems to ensure for more even cooking.\nSpinach can be quick boiled for one minute. Boiling will help to reduce the amount of oxalic acids found in spinach, resulting in a sweeter taste.\nAdd layers of steamed spinach to your next lasagna recipe.\nToss steamed spinach with pressed garlic, fresh lemon juice and olive oil.\nSprinkle with a little Parmesan cheese.\nReplace spinach for basil in pesto recipes and make spinach pesto.\nSpinach salads are a classic easy and delicious meal or side dish.\nfooter.php\nQuality and Variety\nAt Produce Depot we take pride in providing our                      customers with the freshest fruit and vegetables available.

It now is only forested in some wooded areas, such as Radnor Wood, though a fairly large area of forest exists on the Wales\u2013England border north of Anchor (the planted Ceri Forest).\n\nThe ancient Offa's Dyke runs north-south through the area (and can be walked by the Offa's Dyke Path).\n\nIt is a deanery of the Church of England's Diocese of Hereford. \n\nA Shropshire Lad \n\nA. E. Housman wrote as part of his series of poems A Shropshire Lad:\n\n    \"In valleys of springs of rivers      \n       By Ony and Teme and Clun,          \n    The country for easy livers,          \n       The quietest under the sun...\n\n    'Tis a long way further than Knighton,\n       A quieter place than Clun,         \n    Where doomsday may thunder and lighten\n       And little 'twill matter to one.\"\nQuestion:\nClun Forest lies in which English county?\nAnswer:\nSalopia\nPassage:\nTongue and groove\nA strong joint, the tongue and groove joint is widely used for re-entrant angles. The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded.  In expensive cabinet work, glued dovetail and multiple tongue and groove are used.\n\nTongue and groove is a method of fitting similar objects together, edge to edge, used mainly with wood, in flooring, parquetry, panelling, and similar constructions. Tongue and groove joints allow two flat pieces to be joined strongly together to make a single flat surface. Before plywood became common, tongue and groove boards were also used for sheathing buildings and to construct concrete formwork.\n\nEach piece has a slot (the groove) cut all along one edge, and a thin, deep ridge (the tongue) on the opposite edge. The tongue projects a little less than the depth of the groove. Two or more pieces thus fit together closely. The joint is not normally glued, as shrinkage would then pull the tongue off.\n\nIn another assembly method, the pieces are end-matched. This method eliminates the need for mitre joints, face nailing, and the use of joints on 16 inch or 24 inch centres of conventional framing.\n\nFor many uses, tongue and groove boards have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of plywood and later composite wood boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality.  Plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for sub-floors used in platform framing is often supplied with tongue and groove edges.\n\nWhen joining thicker materials, several tongue and groove joints may be used one above the other.\n\nMethods\n\nOne of the following woodworking tools may be used to produce the tongue and groove:\n* A four- or six-head moulder (for large quantities)\n* A wood shaper (spindle moulder)\n* A circular saw bench\n* Suitable hand planes: a plough plane for the groove and a tongue plane for the tongue, or a combination plane\n* A spindle router\n\nTongue-in-groove\n\nTongue-in-groove is similar to tongue and groove, but instead of the tongue forming part of one of the edges, it is a separate, loose piece that fits between two identically grooved edges. The tongue may or may not be of the same material as the grooved pieces joined by the tongue. For example, plywood flooring is commonly grooved at the edges, and plastic tongues are used to form the joint.\nQuestion:\nA tongue and groove joint is used when working with what material?\nAnswer:\nDiffuse-porous wood\nPassage:\nSenegal\nSenegal (;   ), officially the Republic of Senegal (), is a country located in West Africa. Senegal is bordered by the North African country of Mauritania in the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast, and Guinea-Bissau to the southwest. Senegal further borders the country of The Gambia, a sovereign enclave occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the Gambia river, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with the country of Cape Verde. Senegal's economical and political capital is Dakar. It is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia,  and owes its name to the Senegal River, which borders it to the east and north. The name \"Senegal\" comes from the Wolof \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"Our Boat.\" Senegal covers a land area of almost 197000 km2}} and has an estimated population of about 13 million. The climate is Sahelian, but there is a rainy season.\n\nCultures and influences \n\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since the Prehistory. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the Jolof Empire. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, phosphate mining, fertilizer production, petroleum refining, construction materials, ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including peanuts, sugarcane, cotton, green beans, tomatoes, melons, and mangoes.Ndiaye, Mbalo.

Like the advertising posters which came before them, posters from the First World War were designed to motivate the viewer to enlist in the army, or to buy a war bond.\u00a0 They also had a secondary imperative: to inspire the viewer.\u00a0 In fact, in the United States, posters were part of a campaign of salesmanship to get the American public behind the war.\u00a0 American Posters used figures like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and Lady Liberty allegorically.\u00a0 French Bond Posters used Marianne.\nSilver coin featuring Marianne\nMarianne is the personification of the Republique Francaise and a symbol of liberty and freedom.\u00a0 Images of Marianne first appear in 1775 and depict her standing, young and determined, sometimes bare breasted as she leads soldiers into battle.\u00a0 Her image is allegorical, and is inspired by another allegorical figure, that of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and war.\nThe figure was used on the French postage stamp in 1849, and also on the franc.\u00a0 Today she appears on the French Euro coin.\u00a0 We encounter Marianne occasionally in the advertising poster.\nAdvertising poster for Saponite Laundry Soap, featuring Marianne berating a seated Napoleon\nShe is, however, best enjoyed in the poster in French World War One Bond and Reconstruction posters.\nM.

The intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian (zero degrees latitude and longitude) is in the gulf.\n\nAmong the many rivers that drain into the Gulf of Guinea are the Niger and the Volta. The coastline on the gulf includes the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny.\n\nThe Niger River in particular deposited organic sediments out to sea over millions of years which became crude oil. The Gulf of Guinea region, along with the Congo River delta and Angola further south, are expected to provide around a quarter of the United States' oil imports by 2015. This region is now regarded as one of the world's top oil and gas exploration hotspots.\n\nName\n\nThe origin of the name Guinea is thought to be an area in the region, although the specifics are disputed. Bovill (1995) gives a thorough description: \n\nThe name Guinea is usually said to have been a corrupt form of the name Ghana, picked up by the Portuguese in the Maghrib. The present writer finds this unacceptable. The name Guinea has been in use both in the Maghrib and in Europe long before Prince Henry's time. For example, on a map dated about 1320 by the Genoese cartographer Giovanni di Carignano, who got his information about Africa from a fellow-countryman in Sijilmas [ancient trading city in North Africa], we find Gunuia, and in the Catalan atlas of 1375 as Ginyia. A passage in Leo [Africanus] (vol. III, 822) points to Guinea having been a corrupt form of Jenne [2,000-year-old city in central Mali on Niger river], less famous than Ghana but nevertheless for many centuries famed in the Maghrib as a great market and a seat of learning. The relevant passage reads: \"The Kingdom of Ghinea . . . called by the merchants of our nation Gheneoa, by the natural inhabitants thereof Genni and by the Portugals and other people of Europe Ghinea.\" But it seems more probable that Guinea derives from aguinaou, the Berber for Negro. Marrakech [city in southeastern Morocco] has a gate, built in the twelfth century, called the Bab Aguinaou, the Gate of the Negro (Delafosse, Haut-S\u00e9n\u00e9gal-Niger, II, 277-278). The modern application of the name Guinea to the coast dates only from 1481. In that year the Portuguese built a fort, S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina (modern day Elmina), on the Gold Coast region, and their king, John II, was permitted by the Pope [Sixtus II or Innocent VIII] to style himself Lord of Guinea, a title that survived until the recent extinction of the monarchy.\n\nThe name \"Guinea\" was also applied to south coast of West Africa, north of the Gulf of Guinea, which became known as \"Upper Guinea\", and the west coast of Southern Africa, to the east, which became known as \"Lower Guinea.\" The name \"Guinea\" is still attached to the names of three countries in Africa: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea, as well as New Guinea in Melanesia.\n\nGeography\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southwest extent of the Gulf of Guinea as \"A line running Southeastward from Cape Three Points in Western region Ghana () to Cape Lopez in Gabon ()\". \n\nIslands in the Gulf of Guinea\n\nThe Gulf of Guinea contains a number of islands, the largest of which are in a southwest-northeast chain, forming part of the Cameroon line of volcanoes.\n\nAnnob\u00f3n\n\nAnnob\u00f3n, also known as Pagalu or Pigalu, is an island that is part of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nBobowasi Island\n\nBobowasi Island is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Western region Ghana.\n\nBioko\n\nBioko is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nCorisco\n\nCorisco is an island belonging to Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThe Elobeys\n\nElobey Grande and Elobey Chico are two small islands belonging to Equatorial Guinea.\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (officially the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe) is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea that became independent from Portugal in 1975. It is located off the western equatorial coast of Africa and consists of two islands, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. They are located about 140 km apart and about 250 and, respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon. Both islands are part of an extinct volcanic mountain range. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, the sizeable southern island, is situated just north of the Equator.\nQuestion:\nWhich major river empties into the Gulf of Guinea?\nAnswer:\nNiger Republic\nPassage:\nMar Chiquita Lake (C\u00f3rdoba)\nMar Chiquita (in Spanish literally \"Little Sea\") or Mar de Ansenuza is an endorheic salt lake located in the northeast of the province of C\u00f3rdoba, in central Argentina. The northeast corner of the lake also extends into southeastern Santiago del Estero Province. It is the largest of the naturally occurring saline lakes in Argentina. The lake is located in parts of five departments in the two provinces.\n\nThe lake occupies the southern part of a depression that measures about 50 miles/80\u00a0km (north\u2013south) by 28 miles/45\u00a0km (east\u2013west). Its surface area varies considerably, given its shallow depth (about 10 m), and ranges between 2000 and 6000\u00a0km\u00b2 (1242 and 3728\u00a0mi\u00b2).\n\nMar Chiquita is fed primarily by the saline waters of the Dulce River, coming from Santiago del Estero in the north after being joined by the Saladillo River. The lands around the lower course of the Dulce and Mar Chiquita are wetlands, populated by a large biodiversity (especially aquatic birds). From the southwest the lake receives the flow of the Primero/Suqu\u00eda and the Segundo/Xanaes rivers, as well as several streams; these inflows vary greatly from dry to rainy seasons. The salinity of Mar Chiquita is quite variable, with measured extremes ranging from 250 g/l in times of low water levels to around 40 g/l in very humid years, such as in the decade following 1977, when record rainfall flooded much of Miramar, C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nThere are several islands in the lake, the most important one being the M\u00e9dano Island. Mar Chiquita is slowly diminishing in volume due to increased evaporation and elevation of its bottom, and is ultimately bound to turn into a salt flat. The lake was formerly home to a growing tourism industry, and was the site of the Gran Hotel Vienna, a luxurious, lakefront establishment which functioned from 1945 to 1980, and has been the center of numerous mysteries and controversies.\nQuestion:\nMar Chiquita (Cordoba) is the largest natural salt lake in which South American country?\nAnswer:\nArxintina\nPassage:\nFanta\nFanta is a global brand of fruit-flavored carbonated soft drinks created by The Coca-Cola Company. There are over 100 flavors worldwide. The drink originated in Nazi Germany under trade embargo for Coca-Cola ingredients in 1940.\n\nHistory \n\nFanta originated as a result of difficulties importing Coca-Cola syrup into Nazi Germany during World War II due to a trade embargo. To circumvent this, Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola Deutschland (Coca-Cola GmbH) during the Second World War, decided to create a new product for the German market, using only ingredients available in Germany at the time, including whey and apple pomace\u00a0\u2013 the \"leftovers of leftovers\", as Keith later recalled.  The name was the result of a brief brainstorming session, which started with Keith's exhorting his team to \"use their imagination\" (Fantasie in German), to which one of his salesmen, Joe Knipp, immediately retorted \"Fanta!\"\n\nThe plant was effectively cut off from Coca-Cola headquarters during the war. After the war, the Coca-Cola corporation regained control of the plant, formula and the trademarks to the new Fanta product\u2014as well as the plant profits made during the war.\n\nFanta was discontinued when the parent company was reunited with the German branch.  Following the launch of several drinks by the Pepsi corporation in the 1950s, Coca-Cola competed by relaunching Fanta in 1955.  The drink was heavily marketed in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. \n\nMarketing \n\nUnited States \n\nFanta is known for its upbeat advertising; in the United States, it showcases The Fantanas, a group of young female models, each of whom promotes an individual Fanta flavor. For the re-introduction of Fanta in the United States, Coca-Cola worked with the ad agency Ogilvy (NYC) in 2001. After a brainstorming session, the Ogilvy creative team of Andrea Scaglione, Andrew Ladden and Bill Davaris, created the tagline \"Wanta Fanta!\" which became the jingle for the Fantanas in the broadcast campaign. The campaign lasted from summer 2001, in the form of a successful trial run, to October 1, 2006. Three years later, in June 2009, Fanta re-launched the campaign. They also held a talent search to find the pineapple Fantana, and, in September selected Shakira Barrera to become the fourth Fantana.  After Barrera won the search, she spent a year at her post, with the latter six months as an actual Fantana called Lily.\n\nInternational availability \n\nThere are over 90 different flavors worldwide. In Serbia, Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and some other countries, there is \"Fanta Shokata\" (a wordplay between \"soc\" -elderberry in Romanian- and \"shock\") based on an elderflower blossom extract drink, traditional in Romania (where it is called Socat\u0103), Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and other Balkan countries.\n\nOrange Fanta is also available in Canada; however, the formula for Canada's Orange variant differs from its American and German/European counterparts, notably in that the German contains orange juice,  the Canadian contains tangerine juice  and the American contains neither.  The other variants available in Canada are Grape and Cream Soda, both made with real grapes. \n\nPrimary competitors to Fanta have included Tango, Mirinda, Slice, Sumol, Crush, Tropicana Twister and Orangina. Fanta was the second drink to be produced by Coca-Cola, after the original Coca-Cola.\n\nInternational popularity \n\n*In Australia, there are Fanta Labs in many shopping malls. Fanta Lab provides 2 identical \"Labs\" where there is a set of water filter cups to the side and a touch screen, which shows the four available Australian flavors, Mango-Passionfruit, Orange, Grape, and Raspberry, and can choose 4 flavors to be mixed. Therefore, can mix 2 flavors twice, 3 flavors, 4 flavors, or just get a free cup of original Fanta.\n* In Japan, the market often issues seasonal rare flavours like yuzu.\n* In Greece you can find a non-carbonated version of the original Orange Fanta, called Fanta Blue\n\nControversy \n\nA 2005 British television advertisement for Fanta Z showed a couple enjoying a picnic on a beach and drinking from their cans of Fanta Light, but then calmly spitting the drink out. Others were also shown spitting the drink out in similar ways. The viewers complained that the ad condoned spitting and that children were reported to have copied the ad. A head teacher said that children in the playground had mimicked the commercial. The majority of complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the images were disgusting and thought it was inappropriate because spitting posed a health risk. The ad became restricted to the post-9pm broadcasts. The ASA agreed that viewers would not want children to see something perceived as anti-social, but did not consider that the images showing people spitting would cause widespread offense or pose a significant health risk. \n\n75th anniversary advertisement \n\nIn February 2015, a 75th anniversary version of Fanta was released in Germany. Packaged in glass bottles evoking the original design and with an authentic original war-time flavor including 30% whey and pomace, it is described on the packaging as \"less sweet\" and a German original. An associated television ad referenced the history of the drink and said the Coca-Cola company wanted to bring back \"the feeling of the Good Old Times\" which was interpreted by many to mean Nazi rule. The ad was subsequently replaced.\nQuestion:\nFanta Four are one of what country's top hip hop bands?\nAnswer:\nUnited States of Germany\nPassage:\nCyclades\nThe Cyclades (; ,) are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece. They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean archipelago. The name refers to the islands around (\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2) the sacred island of Delos. The Cyclades is where the native Greek breed of cat (the Aegean cat) originated.\n\nHistory\n\nThe significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age (\"Minoan\") culture arose in Crete, to the south: these figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.\n\nA distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer wheat and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Saliagos and Kephala (on Keos) with signs of copper-working, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.\n\nArchaeology\n\nThe first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898\u20131899 and coined the term \"Cycladic civilization\". Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by Jean Arp or Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these Cycladic figurines has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic frying pans. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from Asia Minor c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.\u00a0 3300 \u2013 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is called Helladic culture.\n\nIn recent decades the Cyclades islands have become popular with European and other tourists, and as a result there have been problems with erosion, pollution, and water shortages.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being Amorgos, Anafi, Andros, Antiparos, Delos, Eschati, Ios, Kea, Kimolos, Kythnos, Milos, Mykonos, Naxos, Paros, Folegandros, Serifos, Sifnos, Sikinos, Syros, Tinos, and Thira or Santor\u00edni. The name \"Cyclades\" refers to the islands forming a circle (\"circular islands\") around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.\n\nErmoupolis, on Syros, is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.\n\nThe islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two volcanic islands, Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes wine, fruit, wheat, olive oil, and tobacco.  Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather.\n\nThe Cyclades are bounded to the south by the Sea of Crete. \n\nAdministration\n\nThe Cyclades Prefecture () was one of the prefectures of Greece. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine regional units of the South Aegean region:\n* Andros\n* Kea-Kythnos\n* Milos\n* Mykonos\n* Naxos\n* Paros\n* Santorini\n* Syros\n* Tinos\n\nMunicipalities and communities\n\nThe prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well. \n \n\nProvinces\n\n* Province of Amorgos: Amorgos\n* Province of Andros: Andros\n* Province of Kea: Ioulis\n* Province of Milos: Milos\n* Province of Naxos: Naxos\n* Province of Paros: Paroikia\n* Province of Syros: Ermoupoli\n* Province of Tinos: Tinos\n* Province of Thera: Thera\n\nNote: Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.\n\nCuisine\n\nLocal specialities of the Cyclades include:\n\n* Brantada\n* Fava Santorinis\n* Fourtalia (Andros)\n* Kalasouna (Naxos)\n* Kalogeros (Naxos)\n* Kakavia (soup)\n* Ladopita\n* Louza, similar to the Cypriot lountza\n* Mastelo (Sifnos)\n* Strapatsada\n* Lazarakia (dessert)\n* Melopita (dessert)\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephone\n\n* 22810: Syros, including Kythnos, Serifos and Syros islands\n* 22820: Andros\n* 22830: Tinos\n* 22840: Paros and Sifnos islands\n* 22850: Amorgos and Naxos islands\n* 22860: Folegandros, Ios, Santorini and Sikinos islands\n* 22870: Kimolos and Milos\n* 22880: Kea Island\n* 22890: Mykonos\nQuestion:\nThe Cyclades are an eastern island group of which nation?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nSpinach - Produce Depot\n\u2022 Excellent source of vitamin K.\n\u2022 Great source of Vitamin A\n\u2022 Good source of manganese, folate, and vitamin C\n\u2022 Source of Iron, Magnesium and Potassium\nIn animal studies, researchers have found that spinach may help protect the brain from oxidative stress and may reduce the effects of age-related related declines in brain function. Research indicates that eating a spinach rich diet significantly improved learning capacity and motor skills in adults.\nChoosing & Storing:\nChoose spinach that has vibrant deep green leaves and stems with no signs of yellowing. The leaves should look fresh and tender, and not be wilted or bruised. Store fresh spinach loosely packed in a plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper where it will keep fresh for about five days. Do not wash it before storing as the moisture will cause it to spoil. Avoid storing cooked spinach as it will not keep very well.\n\u00a0\nTips for Preparing Spinach:\u00a0\nSpinach should be washed very well since the leaves and stems tend to collect sand and soil. Before washing, trim off the roots and separate the leaves. Cut away any overly thick stems to ensure for more even cooking.\nSpinach can be quick boiled for one minute. Boiling will help to reduce the amount of oxalic acids found in spinach, resulting in a sweeter taste.\nAdd layers of steamed spinach to your next lasagna recipe.\nToss steamed spinach with pressed garlic, fresh lemon juice and olive oil.\nSprinkle with a little Parmesan cheese.\nReplace spinach for basil in pesto recipes and make spinach pesto.\nSpinach salads are a classic easy and delicious meal or side dish.\nfooter.php\nQuality and Variety\nAt Produce Depot we take pride in providing our                      customers with the freshest fruit and vegetables available.
