{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: CBC had originally decided that none of its rebroadcasters will transition to digital. Also, the CBC had originally planned to not convert any non-originating stations in mandatory markets to digital, which would have forced CBRFT in Calgary and CBXFT-3 in Lethbridge to sign off on the transition date. (Lloydminster, another mandatory market, had no local Radio-Canada transmitter.) On August 16, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted the CBC permission to continue operating 22 repeaters in mandatory markets, including CBRFT and CBXFT-3, in analog until August 31, 2012, by which time the transmitters had to convert to digital or shut down. The remaining transmitters were shut down in 2012.\n\nParagraph 2: From contemporary reviews, The Washington Post gave the album a mixed review, stating that \"even by rap standards, [Schooly D's] work is artless.\" The review compared the album negatively to other rappers, noting that they \"construct complex hip-hop concertos for voice, beat-box and borrowed sounds, Schooly's best-known work is little more than a beat accompanying his foul-mouthed, ill-tempered rants\". The review also found that \"there's no denying that his harsh communiqu\u00e9s crackle with a mean-streets vitality as fascinating as his confrontational world view is disturbing.\" Robert Christgau gave the Jive reissue of the album a B, stating \"What other rapper would write a rhyme about the night his mother pulled a gun on him\u2014or make it so clear that, just like in West Side Story, he's depraved on account of he's deprived. This doesn't speak too well of white critics, obviously, but it also doesn't take away his raps, his rips, or his muscleman groove.\" Spin stated that it \"can't sustain an album with just reverb and a cowbell. Even if it is killer reverb and a way funky cowbell.\" The NME placed Saturday Night! \u2013 The Album at number 20 on their list of the top albums of 1987. The single \"Saturday Night\" was also listed at number 28 on their list of Top 50 tracks of the year. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave the album a three star rating, stating that \"while everything doesn't match [the title track \"Saturday Night\"]\" there's plenty here to establish him as a solid rap citizen.\" declaring that the artist \"may take the most consistently unsparing look at the streets since \"The Message\".\n\nParagraph 3: Harry Haywood's 1948 book, Negro Liberation,  was the first major study of the African-American national question written by an African-American Marxist. He argued that the root of the oppression of Blacks was the unsolved agrarian question in the South. He believed that the unfinished bourgeois democratic revolution of Reconstruction had been betrayed in the Hayes-Tilden Compromise of 1877. It abandoned African Americans to plantations as tenant farmers and sharecroppers, faced with the Redeemer governments, the system of Jim Crow laws, and the terror of the Ku Klux Klan and other paramilitary groups. According to Haywood, the rise of imperialism left blacks frozen as \"landless, semi-slaves in the South.\" According to Haywood's autobiography, Paul Robeson subsidized his work on the project by offering $100 a month. It was translated and published in Russian, Polish, German, Czech and Hungarian. It was reprinted in 1976 by Liberator Press, the publishing arm of the October League. Haywood argued that \"the position of the book was not new, but a reaffirmation of the revolutionary position developed at the Sixth Comintern Congress in 1928. The heart of this position is that the problem is fundamentally a question of an oppressed nation with full rights of self-determination. It emphasized the revolutionary essence of the struggle for Black equality arising from the fact that the special oppression of Blacks is a main prop of the system of imperialist domination over the entire working class and the masses of exploited American people. Therefore the struggle for Black liberation is a component part of the struggle for proletarian revolution. It is the historic task of the working-class movement, as it advances on the road to socialism, to solve the problem of land and freedom of the Black masses.\" On the other hand, Haywood went on to write, \"What was new in the book was the thorough analysis of the concrete conditions of Black people in the post-war period. I made extensive use of population data; the 1940 census, the 1947 Plantation Count and other sources, in order to show that the present day conditions affirmed the essential correctness of the position we had formulated years before.\" Because of this and other works, Robert F. Williams called Harry Haywood \"one of the modern pioneers in the Black liberation struggle.\"\n\nParagraph 4: In 2015 Grant took part in a public debate at the IQ2 stage of The Ethics Centre, with immigration lawyer Pallavi Sinha, Herald Sun columnist Rita Panahi and actor Jack Thompson to argue for or against the topic \"Racism is destroying the Australian dream\". He told of the impact of colonisation on Indigenous Australians, past and present. He argued that \"the Australian Dream\" was based upon racism, mentioning his ancestors and others who were forced into institutions and unpaid work. The debate itself was a finalist in the United Nations Association of Australia Media Peace Awards for \"its role in stimulating public awareness and understanding\".\n\nParagraph 5: Germain Lesage (Raymond Bouchard), a welfare recipient himself and the new mayor, hatches a plan. The entire village will convince Dr. Lewis to stay. They tap his phone, and pretend to share his likes: cricket, fusion jazz, and all the same foods. Henri Giroux (Beno\u00eet Bri\u00e8re), the local banker whose sole job is to cash the townfolks' welfare cheques, leaves small amounts of money for Dr. Lewis to find as small measures to increase Dr. Lewis' happiness about being in town, and attempts to secure a loan through his bank for the bribe. Dr. Lewis likes the beautiful post office worker \u00c8ve Beauchemin (Lucie Laurier), but \u00c8ve knows he has a girlfriend, Brigitte, in Montreal.\n\nParagraph 6: Rockford operates a small private investigation service out of his beachside mobile home in Malibu, California.  The trailer was parked in the lot for  Paradise Cove next to a restaurant. To avoid confrontations with the LAPD, he will not take on open police cases. He also refuses to do domestic cases. He specializes instead in cold cases, missing person cases and small-time insurance scams. At one time, in addition to other clients, he worked on a retainer basis for a major insurance company, but the company scrapped the deal when a case went sour, and Rockford lost the annual income. He charges a flat rate of $200 a day plus expenses for each case, which, in a running gag, he seldom actually receives. Over the years he was involved in several cases for which his investigative efforts should have gained him significant bonuses, but he was never able to collect them. He is consistently shown to be short on money, or trying to keep creditors at bay; he typically wears sport coats and low-priced off-the-rack suits and his lone indulgences are an answering machine (the source of another running gag at the beginning of each episode) and the latest gold colored Pontiac Firebird Esprit automobile, traded in each year of the series for the newest model. (Garner did not like the look and handling of the 1979 model, so the 1978 was reused for the final season in 1979\u201380; this was an apparent use of product placement in the series.) Rockford is an outstanding driver, on several occasions getting out of tricky situations when being followed merely by skillfully maneuvering his vehicle away.\n\nParagraph 7: Ira Allen was born in Cornwall in the Connecticut Colony (in present-day Litchfield County, Connecticut), the youngest of six sons born to Joseph and Mary Baker Allen. In 1771, Allen went to Vermont (then part of the British colonial Province of New York) with his brother Ethan as a surveyor for the Onion River Land Company. The four Allen brothers established the company in 1772 (dissolved 1785) to purchase lands under the New Hampshire Grants. Ira Allen had an almost central role in the dispute with the Province of New York over conflicting land claims in the region such as by gifting land to men who had committed acts for New Hampshire and by confiscating loyalist property to finance government.\n\nParagraph 8: The ground, for a strip of about four miles, was covered with black crickets of a large size. I saw some that were about three inches in length, and measuring about three-fourths of an inch in diameter; but the common size were two inches in length and one-half or five-eighths of an inch in diameter; their legs were large in proportion to the size of their bodies. Some were singing on stalks of wild sage; others crawling in every direction. Our teams made great havoc among them; so numerous were they that we crushed them at every step. As soon as one was killed, others of them would alight upon it and devour it.\n\nParagraph 9: Mehmet proceeds to make things infinitely worse for himself soon after, when he stakes his house and business on a bet, loses and swiftly disappears leaving his wife, Guizin Osman (Ishia Bennison), to face up to the consequences. A then homeless Guzin arrives at Ali and his wife Sue's (Sandy Ratcliff) doorstep with the news that Mehmet had beaten her, and she isn't ever returning to him. Ali and Sue are forced to take Guizin and her three children, Murat, Rayif and Emine (Pelin Ahmet) into their one bedroom apartment. Mehmet returns to Walford in May 1987 and he manages to persuade his long suffering wife to give their marriage another chance. However, his promises to Guizin prove to be hollow as soon after he decides that the barmaid Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) is to be the next sexual conquest. Donna refuses his advances, but can't resist informing Guizin about his offer and Guizin and Donna nearly fight on New Year's Eve that year. Guizin and Mehmet's marriage is highly turbulent and they are always involved in intense arguments, mainly concerning money and gambling. In 1988 Mehmet and Guzin become partners in Ali's caf\u00e9 after Sue gives up working to look after her baby. Mehmet often clashes with his wife about the amount of time he takes off to gamble and the way the caf\u00e9 is run. Later in the year Mehmet and Ali run up huge gambling debts to Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), manageress of Strokes wine bar, and who is also a member of the criminal underworld known as The Firm. Desperate for money the two turn to their caf\u00e9 employee, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), for a loan. He agrees, but charges his employers 10 percent interest and later, when they cannot meet the repayments, he demands a stake in the caf\u00e9. The brothers refuse, but the debt eventually leads to Ali losing the caf\u00e9 to Ian the following year.\n\nParagraph 10: Franck Gaston Henri Sauz\u00e9e (born 28 October 1965) is a French former professional footballer and manager. He played 39 times for the France national team between 1988 and 1993, scoring nine goals and captaining the team several times. He achieved great success at club level during the same period, winning the 1993 UEFA Champions League Final and three league titles with Marseille. Later in his career he earned great plaudits for his performances for Scottish club Hibernian, whom Sauz\u00e9e subsequently managed for a short period. Since ending his active involvement in professional football, Sauz\u00e9e has worked as a football pundit for French television networks.\n\nParagraph 11: This program started in 1983 and a curriculum was developed for Class I to Class V based on inferences from social, linguistic and mathematical surveys and field tests conducted in field area. The curriculum focused on various aspects of education like child development, language learning, mathematical abilities, etc. and was phased in a sequential manner on a hierarchy derived from a Piagetian framework of development of logical and mathematical abilities. The programme also gave special emphasis on the socio-economic and cultural tradition of learner and the state of the schools. The pilot project was started in 1987 in 7 schools across Shahpura and Harda. This number further increased to 25 in 1989. The programme was formally inducted into a state programme under the District Primary Education Programme DPEP of Rajiv Gandhi Prathamik Shiksha Mission (RGPSM) of Madhya Pradesh in 1995. The learning from the trial was further used to develop RGPSM's Seekhna Sikhana curricular package for primary education. This was then followed by a single primary school curricular package for the entire state which stemmed from the Seekhna Sikhana package and this also helped in the development of a curriculum for the \u2018alternative\u2019 primary schools opened by the Madhya Pradesh government under the Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS). One can say that the ultimate objective of Prashika programme was achieved when the Seekhna Sikhana package was adopted in 2001. Thus, the Prashika was the first of Eklavya's programmes to complete the cycle from a micro-level pilot project (1986\u201392) to a macro-level programme implemented at a block level (1995-2001) that was eventually merged into the government school system (2000\u201301) at the state level. However the scope of this programme remained confined to the block as this programme was soon closed down by the state government. But that was not the end of Prashika as it laid foundation for two more similar programmes, the first was the establishment of Shiksha Protsahan Kendras (SPKs) in Shahpur block in 1999 and the second was the setting up of the Bhopal Education Resource Centre (BERC) in 2000. SPKs are centres which operate in rural areas especially in the tribal areas to improve the quality of education of first generation learners through activity based learning. This centre is being run by a community appointed facilitator and adopts the principles developed under PRASHIKA for math and language teaching. BERC is a resource centre in an urban setting for primary and pre-primary education. The main goal of BERC is to encourage primary schools to introduce various activities that would develop interest in reading, writing and expression skills in students, through the production of wall newspaper and renovation of their libraries. In the Makhan Nagar block of Narmadapuram a Basic Abilities Programme was started in some middle schools. Teachers participation was the backbone of this programme. In 2004 a new initiative was also started in Indore as part of the teacher development initiative of the Indore Teacher Resource Centre to improve the abilities of primary school teachers in language and mathematics.\n\nParagraph 12: Kate, Emma, and Michael are siblings shifted from one orphanage to another over their lifetimes. Kate, the eldest, remembers that, ten years ago on Christmas Eve, her mother had made her promise to protect her siblings, and in turn promised the family's reunion. After their rejection by a prospective adoptive mother, the children's current residence (called the Edgar Allan Poe Home for Incorrigible and Hopeless Orphans) sends them to a mansion situated in Cambridge Falls. There, they are introduced to its owner, Dr. Stanislaus Pym, and explore the house. In the basement, a door appears before them, and they discover an emerald-colored book containing no text. When an old photograph is touched to a page of the open book, the children are teleported to the date and location on which the photograph was taken. There, the children observe a witch, titled the Countess, vowing to kill a child every week until the enslaved fathers of the children find what she seeks. The Countess notices the three orphans and calls upon her grotesque henchmen, designated Screechers, to capture them. Kate and Emma escape, but Michael is accidentally left behind. His sisters return to save him, but lose the book (the eponymous 'Emerald Atlas'). In escape, they are hunted by wolves; meet someone named Gabriel; and enter a subterranean maze, where Kate and Michael are captured by Dwarves. There, they discover a fifteen-years-younger Dr. Pym, with whom they recover the Emerald Atlas. Upon finding it, Kate is drawn into an earlier time, where she again meets Dr. Pym, and thence returns to the time she most-recently left. Emma, having tarried with Gabriel to repel the Countess's followers, is shot with a poisonous arrow, but is saved by Gabriel's wisewoman, Granny Peet. Once healed, Emma, backed by the wisewoman, sways the townsfolk into war against the Countess. After their victory, the witch herself remains to be conquered, and holds the imprisoned children on a boat. Kate, now 'chosen' by the Atlas, can travel to any time while in possession of it; but in exchange for the local children's lives, surrenders it. The Countess seizes the book; but is punished by her master, the Dire Magnus, who reveals that Kate and her siblings are the rightful owners of the Atlas and the two other Books of Beginning until, upon the completion of a prophecy, he claims it. After Kate and Dr. Pym rescue the local siblings, she and her siblings return to their own time, where Kate is approached by the Countess. Using the Atlas, Kate drags the Countess into Rhakotis during its conquest by Alexander the Great. In plea, the Countess tells Kate that her mother and father are captives of the Dire Magnus, as bait to lure the siblings into retrieving the Books of Beginning (a trio of volumes enabling command over reality, of which the Atlas is the first) in exchange for their parents\u2019 release. Kate then leaves her in Rhakotis and returns to her own time, where Dr. Pym explains the Books.\n\nParagraph 13: At 32 years of age, she was named ambassador to the United States by Grenada's Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, whose murder Aug. 12, 1983, set off a bloody power struggle on the island nation that led to the US invasion of Grenada. The Reagan administration refused to accept her credentials as ambassador.  On October 25, 1984, Dessima Williams was arrested by INS agents in Washington while Ronald Reagan was in the White House celebrating the first anniversary of his invasion of the tiny island.  The agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service apprehended her as she was leaving a forum on \"Peace in the Americas\" at Howard University. Of the arrest, Willams said:  \"I had just made the keynote address at a conference on Peace in the Caribbean at Howard University. As I left, about six men suddenly approached me. They indicated I was under arrest and that I should get into the car. I had already been pushed against the open door. I was standing there, baffled: \"Why have I been arrested and what is this all about?\" The men\u2014they were armed\u2014tried to keep people away from me. Then one fellow grabbed me by the neck from behind and the other one pushed his hand in my pelvic area and the other hand on my head, and they crumpled me into the car. All I knew was that there were these aggressive, hostile white males speeding off with me in a civilian car. We eventually arrived at a jail, and a woman matron began to search me. She found some little buttons that said, \"Maurice Bishop's Spirit Lives.\" She said, \"They're weapons. They have sharp points.\" I had a lot of foreign currency from years of travelling. \"These are very important documents.\" I was put in a tiny cell and released on bail in the morning. The charge was that I was living here illegally. In fact, I'd been going back and forth from Grenada for eleven or twelve years.\"\n\nParagraph 14: Minh instead arrived to find that the brothers were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 on the night of the coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Di\u1ec7m and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant \u00d0\u1ed7 Th\u01a1, Di\u1ec7m's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1eadu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xu\u00e2n Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam General Paul Harkins, inspected the tunnel and noted that it \"was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing\". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif (), the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citro\u00ebn sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Di\u1ec7m that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Di\u1ec7m was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that \"You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you.\" Another story holds that Di\u1ec7m said \"We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?\" Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.\n\nParagraph 15: On his route to becoming a better man, Sipowicz struggles to overcome his bigotry with the help of his partner Bobby Simone, he and Fancy continue to have beefs but always resolve them. He also eventually comes to terms with his homophobia, mainly due to his initially grudging friendship with precinct Police Administrative Assistant John Irvin. With the birth of his second son, Sipowicz's life seems to be going well. However, a series of devastating personal tragedies over the next few years arise: in May 1996, Andy Jr., who is about to start work as a policeman in Hackensack, New Jersey, is shot and killed while trying to stop a robbery. The shooting sends Andy Sr. into an alcoholic relapse, during which Sylvia briefly throws him out of the house. In November 1998, Bobby Simone dies of an infection caused by heart transplant complications, and less than a year later in May 1999, Sylvia is accidentally killed by the distraught father of PAA Dolores Mayo (whose killer she had been prosecuting)  outside the courtroom. This is then followed by the disappearance and subsequent murder of Simone's successor Danny Sorenson during an undercover assignment in 2001. He also survives a serious bout with prostate cancer in 1998. With the exception of Andy Jr.'s death, however, Sipowicz remains sober in the face of all of these tragedies. He also has to deal with the fact that he had been instrumental in putting an innocent black man in prison for 18 years for the murder of a teenager, remembering that he had no experience as a detective and deferred to a lazy veteran cop. He is the only cop to apologize when the man is released (he learns that the perpetrator was a white man who later died of a drug overdose, and while Sipowicz and the now-retired veteran cop basically knew he'd been murdered, the end result of the case was left unresolved).\n\nParagraph 16: Cogenhoe was involved in the extractive industries.  Digging for iron ore began at Cogenhoe in the late 1850s with opencast quarrying and mines \u2013 the latter of which, according to local lore, collapsed one lunchtime while the men were away having their midday meals. The mines were for whatever reason  opened out in about 1868. The quarries continued up the hill towards the Firs.  These quarries were connected to the main London and North Western Railway in the valley by way of narrow gauge and standard gauge private branch-lines. The narrow gauge line was cable worked taking the ore down to a tipping dock on the standard gauge branch.  In about 1870, the operation moved west with a standard gauge line running through what is now the Pocket Park to the Ironstone field south of the Playing Fields. A short narrow gauge branch always worked by hand or horses connected that quarry to the standard gauge branch. The standard gauge line was originally operated by gravity and horses, the loaded wagons coasting down the gradient from the western end of the line to just south of the road near Roe Farm. However steam locomotives were introduced in 1880 or shortly afterwards.\n\nParagraph 17: The second season received strong reviews, with many critics noting the series's improvement over its first season. At Metacritic, the season received an average review score of 73 out of 100, based on 8 reviews. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds a 91% approval rating with an average score of 8.32/10, based on 23 reviews; the site's critical consensus said, \"Halt and Catch Fire version 2.0 has received some upgrades and improvements, including a welcome focus on its female leads.\" Sepinwall praised the acting, writing, and directing of season two, and noted that one of his frustrations with the first season, the downplaying of Donna and Cameron, was resolved: \"Now it's essentially Halt and Catch Fire 2.0, with all the bugs worked out so that it can function exactly as it first promised.\" Sepinwall summed up the season's changes by saying, \"Those who stayed patient with Halt season 1, or those who come to the show now that the quality has gone up significantly, will be rewarded.\" Andy Greenwald of Grantland called season two a \"hard reboot\" that was exponentially better. He praised the emphasis placed on the female leads, Davis's performance, and how it reframed the male leads, while noting that the focus on Mutiny \"inject[ed] the show with the jittery, caffeinated energy of a start-up\". Willa Paskin of Slate said that the series was able to successfully pivot by shifting focus to a startup setting and to Cameron and Donna, the latter of whom Paskin said \"has blossomed into a character with ambitions all her own\". Commenting on the season's exploration of issues facing working women, Paskin wrote, \"what is so satisfying about its treatment of sexism... is not the extent to which the sexism conforms to our expectations, but that the women involved do not.\" Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker called season two \"such a startling upgrade of the first that it begs for technological metaphors\". She said that the chemistry between Donna and Cameron \"is looser, releasing the show from the burdens of its gloomy forerunners\", and that the marriage between Gordon and Donna felt nuanced. Nussbaum said the series was best at being \"a platform for a fascinating, buried period of history\" that provided \"oddly profound meditations on the nature of originality in the digital age, nested within relationship talk\". James Poniewozik of Time said the show \"remade and refocused itself in its second season\" by focusing on the Cameron\u2013Donna partnership and that \"it now has a compelling subject\". Poniewozik said, \"true to Moore's Law, it has become magnitudes better.\"\n\nParagraph 18: The Dudley Canal and Stourbridge Canal then looked at an extension northwards from Dudley, to join the Birmingham Canal. This would involve a long tunnel, and Lord Dudley and Ward agreed to sell his branch canal and tunnel to the company. The enterprise was authorised by another Act of Parliament, obtained in July 1785, which was steered through the parliamentary process by Lord Dudley and Ward. He was thanked for his efforts, but the company argued that he received sufficient benefit from the convenience of the Dudley Canal and the favourable tolls awarded to him, that payment for his branch canal should not be made, and it never was. The act authorised the company to build five locks to the north of their existing canal, to reach Parkhead, and a long tunnel to link up with Lord Dudley and Ward's Castle Mill Basin. The route was surveyed by John Snape and John Bull, and was checked by Thomas Dadford. He then became the consulting engineer for the project, while Abraham Lees supervised the day-to-day work. In September 1785, the company announced that the tunnel would be  wide, the water would be  deep, and there would be headroom of .\n\nParagraph 19: Two auctions of sealed games by Heritage in July 2021 broke prior records by significant amounts. A sealed copy of The Legend of Zelda, believed to be one of the first printings of the game according to Heritage Auctions and thus making it one of the rarest copies of the game, was auctioned for . A few days later, a sealed copy of one of the first printings of Super Mario 64, rated 9.8 on Wata's scale, one of only five game copies rated this high, sold at auction for . These sales led to some concern that the market for near-mint vintage games may be grossly inflated, since sealed copies of the first printing Super Mario 64 were not considered as rare as previous record-breaking titles. By comparison, a Super Mario 64 package rated at 9.4 on Wata's scale had sold at auction for only  during the same auction period. While there is an expected exponential increase in perceived value with a higher rated game, the jump between these two examples was considered unusual. Video game historian Frank Cifaldi said \"I 100% agree it being a 9.8 puts it at a completely different level but a sudden jump from $30k to $1.5M feels wrong.\" It is believed that those purchasing these sealed games at high prices are speculative collectors of other types of memorabilia, working on the principles of perceived value established there, rather than from gamers that would place more emphasis on a game title's rarity or other similar factors. The involvement of third parties, such as Wata Games and Heritage Auctions, may have contributed to the inflated value of these games, compared to when this was done between hobbyist collectors. A class action lawsuit was filed against Wata claiming the company has manipulated the collecting market.\n\nParagraph 20: The ATP Player and Team of the Year awards are presently given to the player and team who end the year as world No. 1 in the ATP rankings. In earlier years, this was not explicitly the case as in 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1982 and 1989 the Players of the Year named by the ATP (listed below) did not have the No. 1 ranking based on the ATP's point system at the end of that particular year.  In those years, the No. 1 ranking was held by Jimmy Connors (1975\u201378), John McEnroe (1982) and Ivan Lendl (1989). The most successful players in this category are Novak Djokovic in singles, and Bryan brothers in doubles.\n\nParagraph 21: Developed by Carl Gottfrid Fineman, this instrument consists of a magnetic compass, the case of which is covered with a black mirror, around which is movable a circular metal frame. A little window in this mirror enables the observer to see the tip of the compass needle underneath. On the surface of the mirror are engraved three concentric circles and four diameters; one of the latter passes through the middle of the little window. The mirror constitutes a compass card, its radii corresponding to the cardinal points. On the movable frame surrounding the mirror is fixed a vertical pointer graduated in millimeters, which can be moved up and down by means of a rack and pinion. The whole apparatus is mounted on a tripod stand provided with leveling screws.\n\nParagraph 22: In 887, a mutiny at Zhenhai's capital Run Prefecture (), led by Zhou's officer Xue Lang, forced Zhou to flee from Run Prefecture to Chang Prefecture (\u5e38\u5dde, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu) to come under the protection of his officer Ding Congshi () the prefect of Chang Prefecture, while Xue claimed the title of acting military governor.  In response, Qian sent three of the \"Eight Corps\" commanders, Du Leng (), Ruan Jie (), and Cheng Ji () to attack Xue.  After a victory over Xue's officer Li Junwang (), however, for reasons unclear, Du attacked and captured Chang Prefecture, and Ding fled to Huainan.   Qian had Zhou escorted to Hang Prefecture, where he welcomed Zhou in a grand ceremony fitting the ceremony welcome by a subordinate of a military governor.  Zhou would die at Hang Prefecture soon thereafter.  (The New Book of Tang indicated that Qian killed Zhou, but Sima Guang, the lead author of the Zizhi Tongjian, found the account not credible and did not adopt it.)  Meanwhile, Qian ordered Ruan to attack Run Prefecture, and Ruan captured it.  Xue was taken captive, and Qian had his heart cut out of his body to be sacrificed to Zhou.  Qian also sent his cousin Qian Qiu () to attack Su Prefecture (\u8607\u5dde, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), and Qian Qiu captured it in spring 888, allowing Qian Liu to control most of Zhenhai territory, which he largely held onto from this point on\u2014resisting even an imperial attempt to take control of Su, by a failed assassination attempt against the imperially-commissioned prefect Du Ruxiu (), which caused Du Ruxiu to flee and allowed Qian to retain control.  (Su Prefecture was briefly captured by Sun Ru, one of the contenders for control of Huainan after Gao was killed in a mutiny, in late 891, but Qian soon recaptured it, and entered into a temporary alliance with Sun's rival Yang Xingmi, supplying Yang's army with food.)  Meanwhile, to placate Qian, then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) created Qian the Baron of Wuxing, and in 892 gave him the title of the defender of a new Wusheng Circuit () with its headquarters at Hang Prefecture, as well as governor (\u89c0\u5bdf\u4f7f, Guanchashi) of the Su-Hang region and created him the Marquess of Pengcheng.  In 893, Emperor Zhaozong officially made him the military governor of Zhenhai\u2014now with its headquarters at Hang, as Run and Chang prefectures fell into Yang's control in 892.  In 894, Emperor Zhaozong bestowed on Qian the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().  In spring 895, Emperor Zhaozong created Qian the Duke of Pengcheng.\n\nParagraph 23: The archival appraisal theory of Schellenberg was a major factor in the American Friends Service Committee, et al. v. William H. Webster, et.al (1983) case, which began in June 1979 as social action organizations, historians, journalists, and others, sued the U.S. government to stop destruction of FBI files challenging an existing \"archival appraisal decision\" of the National Archives and Records Administration (then called NARS). In 1986, Susan D. Steinwall, then at the Area Research Center at University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls, wrote that this case not only warns archivists to not rely too much \"on the opinions of nonarchivists\", like FBI agents, regarding the usefulness of the records of a specific agency, but it calls into question commonly-held archival assumptions. In her article, she describes how the archivists who appraised the FBI records not only relied on Schellenberg's manual, The Appraisal of Modern Public Records, but on FBI reference material and his own experience. Not only did NARS approving disposal requests for the FBI in 1945 and 1946, but it wasn't until 1978 that they reviewed their appraisal decisions of FBI files under \"mounting public pressure\", and in appraising these records they had relied on the FBI descriptions of their own files, discussing the records they were to dispose with FBI officials before \"approving records disposition requests\". After bringing in the writings of others in the field of archival appraisal, which was purportedly embryonic in the late 1970s, like Philip C. Brooks, JoAnne Yates, and Maynard Brichford she notes that often Schellenberg is evoked in discussion of appraisal because he provided archivists with vocab to describe documentation's \"potential research values.\" She adds that in his book, The Appraisal of Modern Records, Schellenberg described how \"modern public records\" have two types of values, one for \"immediate use of the originating agency and secondary for later use by other agencies and users\", with secondary values considered \"evidential or informational\", with many larger series of records in the National Archives accessioned for information they \"contained regarding matters other than government actions\". She ends her article by arguing that this case, often called the \"FBI files case\", shows that government archivists should reconsider Schellenberg's appraisal philosophy, and notes how some archivists, like Frank Boles and Julia Marks Young, have advocates for not interpreting what Schellenberg says literally, noting that at times, records that have minimal administrative value may have not have, conversely, \"minimal value to research.\"\n\nParagraph 24: A sad and lonely King (played by Kermit) turns to his Loyal Royal Advisor to find him a fair young maiden to be his queen, someone who is special. The King also tells his Loyal Royal Advisor that he will be given his own castle if he succeeds. All the fairest maidens in the land were brought to the King's castle so that one of them can become queen. Wanting the attention of the King, a miller claims to the Loyal Royal Advisor that his daughter Piggy can spin straw into gold when he brings her to the King's Castle. Piggy is placed in a room full of straw where the Loyal Royal Advisor orders her to demonstrate her gift that her father claims that she has or else she will be spending the rest of her life in the dungeon. She ends up receiving the assistance of Rumpelstiltskin (played by Gonzo) who spins the straw into gold upon Piggy giving him her necklace. The next morning, the Loyal Royal Advisor discovers the golden straw and states that he will keep an eye on the gold that is present while Piggy spins a second batch of straw into gold. When Rumpelstiltskin returns that night and wants a fee to convert the straw into gold, she is forced by fate to give up her firstborn upon becoming queen in return for the desperately needed services of Rumpelstiltskin. The next morning, the King and the Loyal Royal Advisor came in and found the golden straw. The King married Piggy and the Loyal Royal Advisor got his own castle. When Queen Piggy finally had her child, Rumpelstiltskin came in and states that he will let her keep her child if he can guess his name. If she cannot guess his name by tomorrow, then the child will end up in the possession of Rumpelstiltskin. Piggy called the King, the Loyal Royal Advisor, and her father where she told them the whole truth about her having help in converting straw into gold. The King mentioned that he married Piggy because he loved her and not because of her supposed talent. The four of them get to work at guessing Rumpelstiltskin's name. When the deadline is up, Rumpelstiltskin returns to see if Piggy has guessed his name and nearly gave it away. Upon recalling that Rumpelstiltskin went to summer camp Piggy has her father and the Loyal Royal Advisor grab him while stating to the King that \"a good mother always sews their child's name in their clothes before sending them off to camp.\" Piggy finds the label that lists Rumpelstiltskin's name and reads it out loud. Rumpelstiltskin declares it an outrage while Piggy, the King, the Loyal Royal Advisor, and the Miller celebrate.\n\nParagraph 25: In 1938, Brown married Elizabeth Potter. During the Second World War, he worked for the Office of Strategic Services as a specialist on French culture. His supervisor was Carl Schorske, and his colleagues included Herbert Marcuse and Franz Neumann. His other friends included the historians Christopher Hill and Hayden White as well as the philosopher Stuart Hampshire. At Wesleyan University, he befriended the composer John Cage, an association that proved fruitful to both. Brown became a professor of classics at Wesleyan. During Brown's tenure there, Schorske became a professor of history and the two engaged in a mutually beneficial interdisciplinary discourse.\n\nParagraph 26: In the 1980s, the company also turned to corporate sponsorship to gain needed national publicity. Stroh was a sponsor of the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, an event that strengthened Stroh's new national standing considerably. For many years Stroh had received little television exposure because of an agreement between the major networks and Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing Company which allowed the two top brewers exclusive advertising rights. Stroh fought the agreement and in 1983 was allotted advertising time on ABC's Monday Night Baseball, on two NBC boxing events, and on other popular U.S. television sports shows. Confronted with nearly prohibitive network costs, the company began \"The Stroh Circle of Sports\" on cable television and independent stations. The program featured live events with reporting and analysis. For increased publicity opportunities, Stroh also turned to such sports as hockey\u2014which had been overlooked by Anheuser and Miller\u2014and sponsored broadcasts of National Hockey League games on the USA cable network. The company also sponsored the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix, an event considered an important boost for Stroh's international name recognition. \"High Rollers\", a contest for amateur bowlers, was also developed and sponsored by the company. Stroh's most popular non-sports promotion during this period was the \"Schlitz Rocks America\" concert series. It also sponsored NASCAR legend Mark Martin in the Winston Cup Series during the 1988 and 1989 seasons. Hall of Fame center Mario Lemieux signed a two-year deal with Stroh's on October 20, 1997, that allowed Lemieux to appear in print ads and in public appearances but allowed him to remain away from television ads. Lemieux's image was also featured on several Stroh's commemorative cans.\n\nParagraph 27: In Chasing Amy, she meets Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards at a comic book convention in New York where the two men are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to her, but soon learns that she is attracted to women. The two begin hanging out and both of them develop a deep friendship, however, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings and confesses his love to Alyssa. She at first is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship. Their new relationship worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who dislikes and distrusts Alyssa and is bothered by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers Alyssa's past and he tells Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys in high school which gave her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". Holden is deeply disturbed by this revelation, having believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. Holden angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game. During a tearful argument, she admits to Holden about her \"many\" youthful sexual experimentations and apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with, however, she refuses to apologize for her past actions, and Holden leaves feeling angry and confused. Inspired by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his fractured friendship with Banky. Holden invites both of them over to his place and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain as her boyfriend and also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him; kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests that the three of them have a threesome. While Banky agrees to participate, however, Alyssa refuses, explaining to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, Alyssa tells Holden that she loves him, but she will not be his whore. One year later, Alyssa is busy promoting her new comic at a convention in New York, where Banky (also promoting his comics in the same convention) gestures Holden to her booth and provides wordless encouragement to talk to her. They have a quiet, emotional conversation and Holden gives her a copy of his new comic \"Chasing Amy\", which is based on their relationship and tells her goodbye. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend arrives and asks who he was. A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa replies, \"Oh, just some guy I knew\". \n\nParagraph 28: When Adolf Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, the family decided to leave, first for Italy (of which the Zadar-born Georg and thus the family were legally citizens). For some months in 1938, just after their flight, they lived in Warmond, near The Hague, Netherlands, as the guests of a Dutch banker, Ernest Menten. This episode is described by local historian Miep Smitsloo in her 2007 Dutch book  'Tussen Tol en Trekvaart' ('Between Toll and Canal'). In her account of the flight, Maria von Trapp does not mention this stay. From there they went to London and then to the United States, where they stayed until the expiration of their visas. After touring in Scandinavia, they returned to the United States on 1939-09-07 where they applied for immigrant status. They arrived with very little money, having lost most of the family fortune earlier during a 1935 banking collapse in Austria. Once in the United States they earned money by performing and touring nationally and internationally, first as the \"Trapp Family Choir\" and then, the \"Trapp Family Singers\", a change suggested by their booking agent Frederick Christian Schang. After living for a short time in Philadelphia and then Merion, Pennsylvania, where their youngest child Johannes was born, the family settled in Stowe, Vermont, in 1941. They purchased a  farm in 1942 and converted it into the Trapp Family Lodge, initially called \"Cor Unum\" (Latin for One Heart). After World War II, they founded the Trapp Family Austrian Relief fund, which sent food and clothing to people impoverished in Austria. By now based permanently in the United States, the family performed their unique mixture of liturgical music, madrigals, folk music and instrumentals to audiences in over 30 countries for the next 20 years. They made a series of 78-rpm records for RCA Victor in the 1950s, some of which were later issued on RCA Camden LPs. There were also a few later recordings released on LPs, including some stereo sessions. The family singing group disbanded in 1957.\n\nParagraph 29: Natalie Craig writing for The Sydney Morning Herald said Toadie was always destined for greatness. She said as a teenager he was a \"major ratbag with a major mullet to match\", but a genius at the same time. Craig opined many \"memorable Toadie moments\" occurred when he shared his home. She cited her favourite ever scene as being one in which Toadie, Joel and Lance had a stand-off over the washing up. Toadie was placed at number six on the Huffpost's \"35 greatest Neighbours characters of all time\" feature. Journalist Adam Beresford described him as an \"Aussie everyman\" with a \"disastrous\" love life; adding he is a \"prime example\" of the joy long-term featured characters give viewers. Beresford described his transformation from \"class clown\" to lawyer after he \"ditched the Hawaiian shirts and the greasy ponytail.\" The critic concluded that Toadie \"earned his place among the Neighbours greats.\" In 2022, Kate Randall from Heat included Toadie in the magazine's top ten Neighbours characters of all time feature. Randall opined that Toadie had \"come a long way\" to become a lawyer. She described him as once being a \"ratbag with long hair and loud Hawaiian shirts.\" She added that Toadie and Stonefish \"wreaked havoc\" on Ramsay Street. Toadie was placed first in a poll ran via soap fansite \"Back To The Bay\", which asked readers to determine the top ten most popular Neighbours characters. In response the Daily Mirror's Susan Knox assessed that Toadie \"has faced endless trials and tribulations\". In an Irish Independent feature profiling \"the top 12 Neighbours icons\", Sheena McGinley titled Toadie as the most iconic. McGinley assessed that \"Toadie's been many things \u2014 cheeky, caring, seemingly gifted in the bedroom department, a lawyer, and a dad.\" She continued to list his many stories but noted his comic persona. McGinley concluded that his comedy \"is why he's the most multi-faceted, relatable character to ever grace the street.\" Lorna White from Yours profiled the magazine's \"favourite Neighbours characters of all time\". Toadie was included in the list and White stated that he had \"become a hugely popular character in the series.\" A reporter from The Scotsman included Toadie and Sonya's wedding day explosion as one of the show's top five moments in its entire history. Toadie and Dee's wedding was placed at number five in a feature compiled for The Guardian, celebrating the show's most memorable moments. Critic Sam Strutt also likened Dee and Toadie's romance to the tale of the Beauty and the Beast.\n\nParagraph 30: In 1997 they released their debut full-length album Under the Western Freeway through Will, and, with the help of Howe Gelb, signed a UK deal with Big Cat Records\u00a0\u2013 by then a subsidiary of Richard Branson's V2 Records\u00a0\u2013 who reissued the album the following year. The album included the single \"A.M. 180\", which was featured during a sequence in the 2002 British film 28 Days Later. It was also used for the theme song for the BBC Four television series Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe (9 years later, Screenwipe debuted in 2006), and in an advertisement for Colin Murray's BBC Radio 1 show. \"A.M. 180\" was also used in television commercials for the Dodge Journey automobile. One of the album's singles, \"Summer Here Kids\", was rated as \"Single of the Week\" by popular British music magazine NME, and was also used as the theme music for another Charlie Brooker-fronted show, BBC Radio 4's So Wrong It's Right. The album led to an increase in the band's popularity in Europe, and a main stage performance at the Reading Festival in 1998. The album was only a success in the US when later reissued by V2. With the band busy touring in 1999, their next release was the compilation The Broken Down Comforter Collection.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text summarizes the life and struggles of a character named Sipowicz. He works to become a better person with the help of his partner Bobby Simone. He confronts his bigotry and homophobia, and deals with personal tragedies such as the death of his son and wife. He also survives prostate cancer and realizes his mistake in putting an innocent man in prison.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from. The answer format must be like \"Paragraph 1\", \"Paragraph 2\", etc.\n\nThe answer is: ", "input": "The text summarizes the life and struggles of a character named Sipowicz. He works to become a better person with the help of his partner Bobby Simone. He confronts his bigotry and homophobia, and deals with personal tragedies such as the death of his son and wife. He also survives prostate cancer and realizes his mistake in putting an innocent man in prison.", "context": "Paragraph 1: CBC had originally decided that none of its rebroadcasters will transition to digital. Also, the CBC had originally planned to not convert any non-originating stations in mandatory markets to digital, which would have forced CBRFT in Calgary and CBXFT-3 in Lethbridge to sign off on the transition date. (Lloydminster, another mandatory market, had no local Radio-Canada transmitter.) On August 16, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted the CBC permission to continue operating 22 repeaters in mandatory markets, including CBRFT and CBXFT-3, in analog until August 31, 2012, by which time the transmitters had to convert to digital or shut down. The remaining transmitters were shut down in 2012.\n\nParagraph 2: From contemporary reviews, The Washington Post gave the album a mixed review, stating that \"even by rap standards, [Schooly D's] work is artless.\" The review compared the album negatively to other rappers, noting that they \"construct complex hip-hop concertos for voice, beat-box and borrowed sounds, Schooly's best-known work is little more than a beat accompanying his foul-mouthed, ill-tempered rants\". The review also found that \"there's no denying that his harsh communiqu\u00e9s crackle with a mean-streets vitality as fascinating as his confrontational world view is disturbing.\" Robert Christgau gave the Jive reissue of the album a B, stating \"What other rapper would write a rhyme about the night his mother pulled a gun on him\u2014or make it so clear that, just like in West Side Story, he's depraved on account of he's deprived. This doesn't speak too well of white critics, obviously, but it also doesn't take away his raps, his rips, or his muscleman groove.\" Spin stated that it \"can't sustain an album with just reverb and a cowbell. Even if it is killer reverb and a way funky cowbell.\" The NME placed Saturday Night! \u2013 The Album at number 20 on their list of the top albums of 1987. The single \"Saturday Night\" was also listed at number 28 on their list of Top 50 tracks of the year. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave the album a three star rating, stating that \"while everything doesn't match [the title track \"Saturday Night\"]\" there's plenty here to establish him as a solid rap citizen.\" declaring that the artist \"may take the most consistently unsparing look at the streets since \"The Message\".\n\nParagraph 3: Harry Haywood's 1948 book, Negro Liberation,  was the first major study of the African-American national question written by an African-American Marxist. He argued that the root of the oppression of Blacks was the unsolved agrarian question in the South. He believed that the unfinished bourgeois democratic revolution of Reconstruction had been betrayed in the Hayes-Tilden Compromise of 1877. It abandoned African Americans to plantations as tenant farmers and sharecroppers, faced with the Redeemer governments, the system of Jim Crow laws, and the terror of the Ku Klux Klan and other paramilitary groups. According to Haywood, the rise of imperialism left blacks frozen as \"landless, semi-slaves in the South.\" According to Haywood's autobiography, Paul Robeson subsidized his work on the project by offering $100 a month. It was translated and published in Russian, Polish, German, Czech and Hungarian. It was reprinted in 1976 by Liberator Press, the publishing arm of the October League. Haywood argued that \"the position of the book was not new, but a reaffirmation of the revolutionary position developed at the Sixth Comintern Congress in 1928. The heart of this position is that the problem is fundamentally a question of an oppressed nation with full rights of self-determination. It emphasized the revolutionary essence of the struggle for Black equality arising from the fact that the special oppression of Blacks is a main prop of the system of imperialist domination over the entire working class and the masses of exploited American people. Therefore the struggle for Black liberation is a component part of the struggle for proletarian revolution. It is the historic task of the working-class movement, as it advances on the road to socialism, to solve the problem of land and freedom of the Black masses.\" On the other hand, Haywood went on to write, \"What was new in the book was the thorough analysis of the concrete conditions of Black people in the post-war period. I made extensive use of population data; the 1940 census, the 1947 Plantation Count and other sources, in order to show that the present day conditions affirmed the essential correctness of the position we had formulated years before.\" Because of this and other works, Robert F. Williams called Harry Haywood \"one of the modern pioneers in the Black liberation struggle.\"\n\nParagraph 4: In 2015 Grant took part in a public debate at the IQ2 stage of The Ethics Centre, with immigration lawyer Pallavi Sinha, Herald Sun columnist Rita Panahi and actor Jack Thompson to argue for or against the topic \"Racism is destroying the Australian dream\". He told of the impact of colonisation on Indigenous Australians, past and present. He argued that \"the Australian Dream\" was based upon racism, mentioning his ancestors and others who were forced into institutions and unpaid work. The debate itself was a finalist in the United Nations Association of Australia Media Peace Awards for \"its role in stimulating public awareness and understanding\".\n\nParagraph 5: Germain Lesage (Raymond Bouchard), a welfare recipient himself and the new mayor, hatches a plan. The entire village will convince Dr. Lewis to stay. They tap his phone, and pretend to share his likes: cricket, fusion jazz, and all the same foods. Henri Giroux (Beno\u00eet Bri\u00e8re), the local banker whose sole job is to cash the townfolks' welfare cheques, leaves small amounts of money for Dr. Lewis to find as small measures to increase Dr. Lewis' happiness about being in town, and attempts to secure a loan through his bank for the bribe. Dr. Lewis likes the beautiful post office worker \u00c8ve Beauchemin (Lucie Laurier), but \u00c8ve knows he has a girlfriend, Brigitte, in Montreal.\n\nParagraph 6: Rockford operates a small private investigation service out of his beachside mobile home in Malibu, California.  The trailer was parked in the lot for  Paradise Cove next to a restaurant. To avoid confrontations with the LAPD, he will not take on open police cases. He also refuses to do domestic cases. He specializes instead in cold cases, missing person cases and small-time insurance scams. At one time, in addition to other clients, he worked on a retainer basis for a major insurance company, but the company scrapped the deal when a case went sour, and Rockford lost the annual income. He charges a flat rate of $200 a day plus expenses for each case, which, in a running gag, he seldom actually receives. Over the years he was involved in several cases for which his investigative efforts should have gained him significant bonuses, but he was never able to collect them. He is consistently shown to be short on money, or trying to keep creditors at bay; he typically wears sport coats and low-priced off-the-rack suits and his lone indulgences are an answering machine (the source of another running gag at the beginning of each episode) and the latest gold colored Pontiac Firebird Esprit automobile, traded in each year of the series for the newest model. (Garner did not like the look and handling of the 1979 model, so the 1978 was reused for the final season in 1979\u201380; this was an apparent use of product placement in the series.) Rockford is an outstanding driver, on several occasions getting out of tricky situations when being followed merely by skillfully maneuvering his vehicle away.\n\nParagraph 7: Ira Allen was born in Cornwall in the Connecticut Colony (in present-day Litchfield County, Connecticut), the youngest of six sons born to Joseph and Mary Baker Allen. In 1771, Allen went to Vermont (then part of the British colonial Province of New York) with his brother Ethan as a surveyor for the Onion River Land Company. The four Allen brothers established the company in 1772 (dissolved 1785) to purchase lands under the New Hampshire Grants. Ira Allen had an almost central role in the dispute with the Province of New York over conflicting land claims in the region such as by gifting land to men who had committed acts for New Hampshire and by confiscating loyalist property to finance government.\n\nParagraph 8: The ground, for a strip of about four miles, was covered with black crickets of a large size. I saw some that were about three inches in length, and measuring about three-fourths of an inch in diameter; but the common size were two inches in length and one-half or five-eighths of an inch in diameter; their legs were large in proportion to the size of their bodies. Some were singing on stalks of wild sage; others crawling in every direction. Our teams made great havoc among them; so numerous were they that we crushed them at every step. As soon as one was killed, others of them would alight upon it and devour it.\n\nParagraph 9: Mehmet proceeds to make things infinitely worse for himself soon after, when he stakes his house and business on a bet, loses and swiftly disappears leaving his wife, Guizin Osman (Ishia Bennison), to face up to the consequences. A then homeless Guzin arrives at Ali and his wife Sue's (Sandy Ratcliff) doorstep with the news that Mehmet had beaten her, and she isn't ever returning to him. Ali and Sue are forced to take Guizin and her three children, Murat, Rayif and Emine (Pelin Ahmet) into their one bedroom apartment. Mehmet returns to Walford in May 1987 and he manages to persuade his long suffering wife to give their marriage another chance. However, his promises to Guizin prove to be hollow as soon after he decides that the barmaid Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) is to be the next sexual conquest. Donna refuses his advances, but can't resist informing Guizin about his offer and Guizin and Donna nearly fight on New Year's Eve that year. Guizin and Mehmet's marriage is highly turbulent and they are always involved in intense arguments, mainly concerning money and gambling. In 1988 Mehmet and Guzin become partners in Ali's caf\u00e9 after Sue gives up working to look after her baby. Mehmet often clashes with his wife about the amount of time he takes off to gamble and the way the caf\u00e9 is run. Later in the year Mehmet and Ali run up huge gambling debts to Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), manageress of Strokes wine bar, and who is also a member of the criminal underworld known as The Firm. Desperate for money the two turn to their caf\u00e9 employee, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), for a loan. He agrees, but charges his employers 10 percent interest and later, when they cannot meet the repayments, he demands a stake in the caf\u00e9. The brothers refuse, but the debt eventually leads to Ali losing the caf\u00e9 to Ian the following year.\n\nParagraph 10: Franck Gaston Henri Sauz\u00e9e (born 28 October 1965) is a French former professional footballer and manager. He played 39 times for the France national team between 1988 and 1993, scoring nine goals and captaining the team several times. He achieved great success at club level during the same period, winning the 1993 UEFA Champions League Final and three league titles with Marseille. Later in his career he earned great plaudits for his performances for Scottish club Hibernian, whom Sauz\u00e9e subsequently managed for a short period. Since ending his active involvement in professional football, Sauz\u00e9e has worked as a football pundit for French television networks.\n\nParagraph 11: This program started in 1983 and a curriculum was developed for Class I to Class V based on inferences from social, linguistic and mathematical surveys and field tests conducted in field area. The curriculum focused on various aspects of education like child development, language learning, mathematical abilities, etc. and was phased in a sequential manner on a hierarchy derived from a Piagetian framework of development of logical and mathematical abilities. The programme also gave special emphasis on the socio-economic and cultural tradition of learner and the state of the schools. The pilot project was started in 1987 in 7 schools across Shahpura and Harda. This number further increased to 25 in 1989. The programme was formally inducted into a state programme under the District Primary Education Programme DPEP of Rajiv Gandhi Prathamik Shiksha Mission (RGPSM) of Madhya Pradesh in 1995. The learning from the trial was further used to develop RGPSM's Seekhna Sikhana curricular package for primary education. This was then followed by a single primary school curricular package for the entire state which stemmed from the Seekhna Sikhana package and this also helped in the development of a curriculum for the \u2018alternative\u2019 primary schools opened by the Madhya Pradesh government under the Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS). One can say that the ultimate objective of Prashika programme was achieved when the Seekhna Sikhana package was adopted in 2001. Thus, the Prashika was the first of Eklavya's programmes to complete the cycle from a micro-level pilot project (1986\u201392) to a macro-level programme implemented at a block level (1995-2001) that was eventually merged into the government school system (2000\u201301) at the state level. However the scope of this programme remained confined to the block as this programme was soon closed down by the state government. But that was not the end of Prashika as it laid foundation for two more similar programmes, the first was the establishment of Shiksha Protsahan Kendras (SPKs) in Shahpur block in 1999 and the second was the setting up of the Bhopal Education Resource Centre (BERC) in 2000. SPKs are centres which operate in rural areas especially in the tribal areas to improve the quality of education of first generation learners through activity based learning. This centre is being run by a community appointed facilitator and adopts the principles developed under PRASHIKA for math and language teaching. BERC is a resource centre in an urban setting for primary and pre-primary education. The main goal of BERC is to encourage primary schools to introduce various activities that would develop interest in reading, writing and expression skills in students, through the production of wall newspaper and renovation of their libraries. In the Makhan Nagar block of Narmadapuram a Basic Abilities Programme was started in some middle schools. Teachers participation was the backbone of this programme. In 2004 a new initiative was also started in Indore as part of the teacher development initiative of the Indore Teacher Resource Centre to improve the abilities of primary school teachers in language and mathematics.\n\nParagraph 12: Kate, Emma, and Michael are siblings shifted from one orphanage to another over their lifetimes. Kate, the eldest, remembers that, ten years ago on Christmas Eve, her mother had made her promise to protect her siblings, and in turn promised the family's reunion. After their rejection by a prospective adoptive mother, the children's current residence (called the Edgar Allan Poe Home for Incorrigible and Hopeless Orphans) sends them to a mansion situated in Cambridge Falls. There, they are introduced to its owner, Dr. Stanislaus Pym, and explore the house. In the basement, a door appears before them, and they discover an emerald-colored book containing no text. When an old photograph is touched to a page of the open book, the children are teleported to the date and location on which the photograph was taken. There, the children observe a witch, titled the Countess, vowing to kill a child every week until the enslaved fathers of the children find what she seeks. The Countess notices the three orphans and calls upon her grotesque henchmen, designated Screechers, to capture them. Kate and Emma escape, but Michael is accidentally left behind. His sisters return to save him, but lose the book (the eponymous 'Emerald Atlas'). In escape, they are hunted by wolves; meet someone named Gabriel; and enter a subterranean maze, where Kate and Michael are captured by Dwarves. There, they discover a fifteen-years-younger Dr. Pym, with whom they recover the Emerald Atlas. Upon finding it, Kate is drawn into an earlier time, where she again meets Dr. Pym, and thence returns to the time she most-recently left. Emma, having tarried with Gabriel to repel the Countess's followers, is shot with a poisonous arrow, but is saved by Gabriel's wisewoman, Granny Peet. Once healed, Emma, backed by the wisewoman, sways the townsfolk into war against the Countess. After their victory, the witch herself remains to be conquered, and holds the imprisoned children on a boat. Kate, now 'chosen' by the Atlas, can travel to any time while in possession of it; but in exchange for the local children's lives, surrenders it. The Countess seizes the book; but is punished by her master, the Dire Magnus, who reveals that Kate and her siblings are the rightful owners of the Atlas and the two other Books of Beginning until, upon the completion of a prophecy, he claims it. After Kate and Dr. Pym rescue the local siblings, she and her siblings return to their own time, where Kate is approached by the Countess. Using the Atlas, Kate drags the Countess into Rhakotis during its conquest by Alexander the Great. In plea, the Countess tells Kate that her mother and father are captives of the Dire Magnus, as bait to lure the siblings into retrieving the Books of Beginning (a trio of volumes enabling command over reality, of which the Atlas is the first) in exchange for their parents\u2019 release. Kate then leaves her in Rhakotis and returns to her own time, where Dr. Pym explains the Books.\n\nParagraph 13: At 32 years of age, she was named ambassador to the United States by Grenada's Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, whose murder Aug. 12, 1983, set off a bloody power struggle on the island nation that led to the US invasion of Grenada. The Reagan administration refused to accept her credentials as ambassador.  On October 25, 1984, Dessima Williams was arrested by INS agents in Washington while Ronald Reagan was in the White House celebrating the first anniversary of his invasion of the tiny island.  The agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service apprehended her as she was leaving a forum on \"Peace in the Americas\" at Howard University. Of the arrest, Willams said:  \"I had just made the keynote address at a conference on Peace in the Caribbean at Howard University. As I left, about six men suddenly approached me. They indicated I was under arrest and that I should get into the car. I had already been pushed against the open door. I was standing there, baffled: \"Why have I been arrested and what is this all about?\" The men\u2014they were armed\u2014tried to keep people away from me. Then one fellow grabbed me by the neck from behind and the other one pushed his hand in my pelvic area and the other hand on my head, and they crumpled me into the car. All I knew was that there were these aggressive, hostile white males speeding off with me in a civilian car. We eventually arrived at a jail, and a woman matron began to search me. She found some little buttons that said, \"Maurice Bishop's Spirit Lives.\" She said, \"They're weapons. They have sharp points.\" I had a lot of foreign currency from years of travelling. \"These are very important documents.\" I was put in a tiny cell and released on bail in the morning. The charge was that I was living here illegally. In fact, I'd been going back and forth from Grenada for eleven or twelve years.\"\n\nParagraph 14: Minh instead arrived to find that the brothers were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 on the night of the coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Di\u1ec7m and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant \u00d0\u1ed7 Th\u01a1, Di\u1ec7m's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1eadu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xu\u00e2n Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam General Paul Harkins, inspected the tunnel and noted that it \"was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing\". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif (), the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citro\u00ebn sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Di\u1ec7m that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Di\u1ec7m was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that \"You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you.\" Another story holds that Di\u1ec7m said \"We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?\" Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.\n\nParagraph 15: On his route to becoming a better man, Sipowicz struggles to overcome his bigotry with the help of his partner Bobby Simone, he and Fancy continue to have beefs but always resolve them. He also eventually comes to terms with his homophobia, mainly due to his initially grudging friendship with precinct Police Administrative Assistant John Irvin. With the birth of his second son, Sipowicz's life seems to be going well. However, a series of devastating personal tragedies over the next few years arise: in May 1996, Andy Jr., who is about to start work as a policeman in Hackensack, New Jersey, is shot and killed while trying to stop a robbery. The shooting sends Andy Sr. into an alcoholic relapse, during which Sylvia briefly throws him out of the house. In November 1998, Bobby Simone dies of an infection caused by heart transplant complications, and less than a year later in May 1999, Sylvia is accidentally killed by the distraught father of PAA Dolores Mayo (whose killer she had been prosecuting)  outside the courtroom. This is then followed by the disappearance and subsequent murder of Simone's successor Danny Sorenson during an undercover assignment in 2001. He also survives a serious bout with prostate cancer in 1998. With the exception of Andy Jr.'s death, however, Sipowicz remains sober in the face of all of these tragedies. He also has to deal with the fact that he had been instrumental in putting an innocent black man in prison for 18 years for the murder of a teenager, remembering that he had no experience as a detective and deferred to a lazy veteran cop. He is the only cop to apologize when the man is released (he learns that the perpetrator was a white man who later died of a drug overdose, and while Sipowicz and the now-retired veteran cop basically knew he'd been murdered, the end result of the case was left unresolved).\n\nParagraph 16: Cogenhoe was involved in the extractive industries.  Digging for iron ore began at Cogenhoe in the late 1850s with opencast quarrying and mines \u2013 the latter of which, according to local lore, collapsed one lunchtime while the men were away having their midday meals. The mines were for whatever reason  opened out in about 1868. The quarries continued up the hill towards the Firs.  These quarries were connected to the main London and North Western Railway in the valley by way of narrow gauge and standard gauge private branch-lines. The narrow gauge line was cable worked taking the ore down to a tipping dock on the standard gauge branch.  In about 1870, the operation moved west with a standard gauge line running through what is now the Pocket Park to the Ironstone field south of the Playing Fields. A short narrow gauge branch always worked by hand or horses connected that quarry to the standard gauge branch. The standard gauge line was originally operated by gravity and horses, the loaded wagons coasting down the gradient from the western end of the line to just south of the road near Roe Farm. However steam locomotives were introduced in 1880 or shortly afterwards.\n\nParagraph 17: The second season received strong reviews, with many critics noting the series's improvement over its first season. At Metacritic, the season received an average review score of 73 out of 100, based on 8 reviews. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds a 91% approval rating with an average score of 8.32/10, based on 23 reviews; the site's critical consensus said, \"Halt and Catch Fire version 2.0 has received some upgrades and improvements, including a welcome focus on its female leads.\" Sepinwall praised the acting, writing, and directing of season two, and noted that one of his frustrations with the first season, the downplaying of Donna and Cameron, was resolved: \"Now it's essentially Halt and Catch Fire 2.0, with all the bugs worked out so that it can function exactly as it first promised.\" Sepinwall summed up the season's changes by saying, \"Those who stayed patient with Halt season 1, or those who come to the show now that the quality has gone up significantly, will be rewarded.\" Andy Greenwald of Grantland called season two a \"hard reboot\" that was exponentially better. He praised the emphasis placed on the female leads, Davis's performance, and how it reframed the male leads, while noting that the focus on Mutiny \"inject[ed] the show with the jittery, caffeinated energy of a start-up\". Willa Paskin of Slate said that the series was able to successfully pivot by shifting focus to a startup setting and to Cameron and Donna, the latter of whom Paskin said \"has blossomed into a character with ambitions all her own\". Commenting on the season's exploration of issues facing working women, Paskin wrote, \"what is so satisfying about its treatment of sexism... is not the extent to which the sexism conforms to our expectations, but that the women involved do not.\" Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker called season two \"such a startling upgrade of the first that it begs for technological metaphors\". She said that the chemistry between Donna and Cameron \"is looser, releasing the show from the burdens of its gloomy forerunners\", and that the marriage between Gordon and Donna felt nuanced. Nussbaum said the series was best at being \"a platform for a fascinating, buried period of history\" that provided \"oddly profound meditations on the nature of originality in the digital age, nested within relationship talk\". James Poniewozik of Time said the show \"remade and refocused itself in its second season\" by focusing on the Cameron\u2013Donna partnership and that \"it now has a compelling subject\". Poniewozik said, \"true to Moore's Law, it has become magnitudes better.\"\n\nParagraph 18: The Dudley Canal and Stourbridge Canal then looked at an extension northwards from Dudley, to join the Birmingham Canal. This would involve a long tunnel, and Lord Dudley and Ward agreed to sell his branch canal and tunnel to the company. The enterprise was authorised by another Act of Parliament, obtained in July 1785, which was steered through the parliamentary process by Lord Dudley and Ward. He was thanked for his efforts, but the company argued that he received sufficient benefit from the convenience of the Dudley Canal and the favourable tolls awarded to him, that payment for his branch canal should not be made, and it never was. The act authorised the company to build five locks to the north of their existing canal, to reach Parkhead, and a long tunnel to link up with Lord Dudley and Ward's Castle Mill Basin. The route was surveyed by John Snape and John Bull, and was checked by Thomas Dadford. He then became the consulting engineer for the project, while Abraham Lees supervised the day-to-day work. In September 1785, the company announced that the tunnel would be  wide, the water would be  deep, and there would be headroom of .\n\nParagraph 19: Two auctions of sealed games by Heritage in July 2021 broke prior records by significant amounts. A sealed copy of The Legend of Zelda, believed to be one of the first printings of the game according to Heritage Auctions and thus making it one of the rarest copies of the game, was auctioned for . A few days later, a sealed copy of one of the first printings of Super Mario 64, rated 9.8 on Wata's scale, one of only five game copies rated this high, sold at auction for . These sales led to some concern that the market for near-mint vintage games may be grossly inflated, since sealed copies of the first printing Super Mario 64 were not considered as rare as previous record-breaking titles. By comparison, a Super Mario 64 package rated at 9.4 on Wata's scale had sold at auction for only  during the same auction period. While there is an expected exponential increase in perceived value with a higher rated game, the jump between these two examples was considered unusual. Video game historian Frank Cifaldi said \"I 100% agree it being a 9.8 puts it at a completely different level but a sudden jump from $30k to $1.5M feels wrong.\" It is believed that those purchasing these sealed games at high prices are speculative collectors of other types of memorabilia, working on the principles of perceived value established there, rather than from gamers that would place more emphasis on a game title's rarity or other similar factors. The involvement of third parties, such as Wata Games and Heritage Auctions, may have contributed to the inflated value of these games, compared to when this was done between hobbyist collectors. A class action lawsuit was filed against Wata claiming the company has manipulated the collecting market.\n\nParagraph 20: The ATP Player and Team of the Year awards are presently given to the player and team who end the year as world No. 1 in the ATP rankings. In earlier years, this was not explicitly the case as in 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1982 and 1989 the Players of the Year named by the ATP (listed below) did not have the No. 1 ranking based on the ATP's point system at the end of that particular year.  In those years, the No. 1 ranking was held by Jimmy Connors (1975\u201378), John McEnroe (1982) and Ivan Lendl (1989). The most successful players in this category are Novak Djokovic in singles, and Bryan brothers in doubles.\n\nParagraph 21: Developed by Carl Gottfrid Fineman, this instrument consists of a magnetic compass, the case of which is covered with a black mirror, around which is movable a circular metal frame. A little window in this mirror enables the observer to see the tip of the compass needle underneath. On the surface of the mirror are engraved three concentric circles and four diameters; one of the latter passes through the middle of the little window. The mirror constitutes a compass card, its radii corresponding to the cardinal points. On the movable frame surrounding the mirror is fixed a vertical pointer graduated in millimeters, which can be moved up and down by means of a rack and pinion. The whole apparatus is mounted on a tripod stand provided with leveling screws.\n\nParagraph 22: In 887, a mutiny at Zhenhai's capital Run Prefecture (), led by Zhou's officer Xue Lang, forced Zhou to flee from Run Prefecture to Chang Prefecture (\u5e38\u5dde, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu) to come under the protection of his officer Ding Congshi () the prefect of Chang Prefecture, while Xue claimed the title of acting military governor.  In response, Qian sent three of the \"Eight Corps\" commanders, Du Leng (), Ruan Jie (), and Cheng Ji () to attack Xue.  After a victory over Xue's officer Li Junwang (), however, for reasons unclear, Du attacked and captured Chang Prefecture, and Ding fled to Huainan.   Qian had Zhou escorted to Hang Prefecture, where he welcomed Zhou in a grand ceremony fitting the ceremony welcome by a subordinate of a military governor.  Zhou would die at Hang Prefecture soon thereafter.  (The New Book of Tang indicated that Qian killed Zhou, but Sima Guang, the lead author of the Zizhi Tongjian, found the account not credible and did not adopt it.)  Meanwhile, Qian ordered Ruan to attack Run Prefecture, and Ruan captured it.  Xue was taken captive, and Qian had his heart cut out of his body to be sacrificed to Zhou.  Qian also sent his cousin Qian Qiu () to attack Su Prefecture (\u8607\u5dde, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), and Qian Qiu captured it in spring 888, allowing Qian Liu to control most of Zhenhai territory, which he largely held onto from this point on\u2014resisting even an imperial attempt to take control of Su, by a failed assassination attempt against the imperially-commissioned prefect Du Ruxiu (), which caused Du Ruxiu to flee and allowed Qian to retain control.  (Su Prefecture was briefly captured by Sun Ru, one of the contenders for control of Huainan after Gao was killed in a mutiny, in late 891, but Qian soon recaptured it, and entered into a temporary alliance with Sun's rival Yang Xingmi, supplying Yang's army with food.)  Meanwhile, to placate Qian, then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) created Qian the Baron of Wuxing, and in 892 gave him the title of the defender of a new Wusheng Circuit () with its headquarters at Hang Prefecture, as well as governor (\u89c0\u5bdf\u4f7f, Guanchashi) of the Su-Hang region and created him the Marquess of Pengcheng.  In 893, Emperor Zhaozong officially made him the military governor of Zhenhai\u2014now with its headquarters at Hang, as Run and Chang prefectures fell into Yang's control in 892.  In 894, Emperor Zhaozong bestowed on Qian the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().  In spring 895, Emperor Zhaozong created Qian the Duke of Pengcheng.\n\nParagraph 23: The archival appraisal theory of Schellenberg was a major factor in the American Friends Service Committee, et al. v. William H. Webster, et.al (1983) case, which began in June 1979 as social action organizations, historians, journalists, and others, sued the U.S. government to stop destruction of FBI files challenging an existing \"archival appraisal decision\" of the National Archives and Records Administration (then called NARS). In 1986, Susan D. Steinwall, then at the Area Research Center at University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls, wrote that this case not only warns archivists to not rely too much \"on the opinions of nonarchivists\", like FBI agents, regarding the usefulness of the records of a specific agency, but it calls into question commonly-held archival assumptions. In her article, she describes how the archivists who appraised the FBI records not only relied on Schellenberg's manual, The Appraisal of Modern Public Records, but on FBI reference material and his own experience. Not only did NARS approving disposal requests for the FBI in 1945 and 1946, but it wasn't until 1978 that they reviewed their appraisal decisions of FBI files under \"mounting public pressure\", and in appraising these records they had relied on the FBI descriptions of their own files, discussing the records they were to dispose with FBI officials before \"approving records disposition requests\". After bringing in the writings of others in the field of archival appraisal, which was purportedly embryonic in the late 1970s, like Philip C. Brooks, JoAnne Yates, and Maynard Brichford she notes that often Schellenberg is evoked in discussion of appraisal because he provided archivists with vocab to describe documentation's \"potential research values.\" She adds that in his book, The Appraisal of Modern Records, Schellenberg described how \"modern public records\" have two types of values, one for \"immediate use of the originating agency and secondary for later use by other agencies and users\", with secondary values considered \"evidential or informational\", with many larger series of records in the National Archives accessioned for information they \"contained regarding matters other than government actions\". She ends her article by arguing that this case, often called the \"FBI files case\", shows that government archivists should reconsider Schellenberg's appraisal philosophy, and notes how some archivists, like Frank Boles and Julia Marks Young, have advocates for not interpreting what Schellenberg says literally, noting that at times, records that have minimal administrative value may have not have, conversely, \"minimal value to research.\"\n\nParagraph 24: A sad and lonely King (played by Kermit) turns to his Loyal Royal Advisor to find him a fair young maiden to be his queen, someone who is special. The King also tells his Loyal Royal Advisor that he will be given his own castle if he succeeds. All the fairest maidens in the land were brought to the King's castle so that one of them can become queen. Wanting the attention of the King, a miller claims to the Loyal Royal Advisor that his daughter Piggy can spin straw into gold when he brings her to the King's Castle. Piggy is placed in a room full of straw where the Loyal Royal Advisor orders her to demonstrate her gift that her father claims that she has or else she will be spending the rest of her life in the dungeon. She ends up receiving the assistance of Rumpelstiltskin (played by Gonzo) who spins the straw into gold upon Piggy giving him her necklace. The next morning, the Loyal Royal Advisor discovers the golden straw and states that he will keep an eye on the gold that is present while Piggy spins a second batch of straw into gold. When Rumpelstiltskin returns that night and wants a fee to convert the straw into gold, she is forced by fate to give up her firstborn upon becoming queen in return for the desperately needed services of Rumpelstiltskin. The next morning, the King and the Loyal Royal Advisor came in and found the golden straw. The King married Piggy and the Loyal Royal Advisor got his own castle. When Queen Piggy finally had her child, Rumpelstiltskin came in and states that he will let her keep her child if he can guess his name. If she cannot guess his name by tomorrow, then the child will end up in the possession of Rumpelstiltskin. Piggy called the King, the Loyal Royal Advisor, and her father where she told them the whole truth about her having help in converting straw into gold. The King mentioned that he married Piggy because he loved her and not because of her supposed talent. The four of them get to work at guessing Rumpelstiltskin's name. When the deadline is up, Rumpelstiltskin returns to see if Piggy has guessed his name and nearly gave it away. Upon recalling that Rumpelstiltskin went to summer camp Piggy has her father and the Loyal Royal Advisor grab him while stating to the King that \"a good mother always sews their child's name in their clothes before sending them off to camp.\" Piggy finds the label that lists Rumpelstiltskin's name and reads it out loud. Rumpelstiltskin declares it an outrage while Piggy, the King, the Loyal Royal Advisor, and the Miller celebrate.\n\nParagraph 25: In 1938, Brown married Elizabeth Potter. During the Second World War, he worked for the Office of Strategic Services as a specialist on French culture. His supervisor was Carl Schorske, and his colleagues included Herbert Marcuse and Franz Neumann. His other friends included the historians Christopher Hill and Hayden White as well as the philosopher Stuart Hampshire. At Wesleyan University, he befriended the composer John Cage, an association that proved fruitful to both. Brown became a professor of classics at Wesleyan. During Brown's tenure there, Schorske became a professor of history and the two engaged in a mutually beneficial interdisciplinary discourse.\n\nParagraph 26: In the 1980s, the company also turned to corporate sponsorship to gain needed national publicity. Stroh was a sponsor of the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, an event that strengthened Stroh's new national standing considerably. For many years Stroh had received little television exposure because of an agreement between the major networks and Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing Company which allowed the two top brewers exclusive advertising rights. Stroh fought the agreement and in 1983 was allotted advertising time on ABC's Monday Night Baseball, on two NBC boxing events, and on other popular U.S. television sports shows. Confronted with nearly prohibitive network costs, the company began \"The Stroh Circle of Sports\" on cable television and independent stations. The program featured live events with reporting and analysis. For increased publicity opportunities, Stroh also turned to such sports as hockey\u2014which had been overlooked by Anheuser and Miller\u2014and sponsored broadcasts of National Hockey League games on the USA cable network. The company also sponsored the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix, an event considered an important boost for Stroh's international name recognition. \"High Rollers\", a contest for amateur bowlers, was also developed and sponsored by the company. Stroh's most popular non-sports promotion during this period was the \"Schlitz Rocks America\" concert series. It also sponsored NASCAR legend Mark Martin in the Winston Cup Series during the 1988 and 1989 seasons. Hall of Fame center Mario Lemieux signed a two-year deal with Stroh's on October 20, 1997, that allowed Lemieux to appear in print ads and in public appearances but allowed him to remain away from television ads. Lemieux's image was also featured on several Stroh's commemorative cans.\n\nParagraph 27: In Chasing Amy, she meets Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards at a comic book convention in New York where the two men are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to her, but soon learns that she is attracted to women. The two begin hanging out and both of them develop a deep friendship, however, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings and confesses his love to Alyssa. She at first is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship. Their new relationship worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who dislikes and distrusts Alyssa and is bothered by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers Alyssa's past and he tells Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys in high school which gave her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". Holden is deeply disturbed by this revelation, having believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. Holden angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game. During a tearful argument, she admits to Holden about her \"many\" youthful sexual experimentations and apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with, however, she refuses to apologize for her past actions, and Holden leaves feeling angry and confused. Inspired by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his fractured friendship with Banky. Holden invites both of them over to his place and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain as her boyfriend and also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him; kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests that the three of them have a threesome. While Banky agrees to participate, however, Alyssa refuses, explaining to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, Alyssa tells Holden that she loves him, but she will not be his whore. One year later, Alyssa is busy promoting her new comic at a convention in New York, where Banky (also promoting his comics in the same convention) gestures Holden to her booth and provides wordless encouragement to talk to her. They have a quiet, emotional conversation and Holden gives her a copy of his new comic \"Chasing Amy\", which is based on their relationship and tells her goodbye. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend arrives and asks who he was. A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa replies, \"Oh, just some guy I knew\". \n\nParagraph 28: When Adolf Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, the family decided to leave, first for Italy (of which the Zadar-born Georg and thus the family were legally citizens). For some months in 1938, just after their flight, they lived in Warmond, near The Hague, Netherlands, as the guests of a Dutch banker, Ernest Menten. This episode is described by local historian Miep Smitsloo in her 2007 Dutch book  'Tussen Tol en Trekvaart' ('Between Toll and Canal'). In her account of the flight, Maria von Trapp does not mention this stay. From there they went to London and then to the United States, where they stayed until the expiration of their visas. After touring in Scandinavia, they returned to the United States on 1939-09-07 where they applied for immigrant status. They arrived with very little money, having lost most of the family fortune earlier during a 1935 banking collapse in Austria. Once in the United States they earned money by performing and touring nationally and internationally, first as the \"Trapp Family Choir\" and then, the \"Trapp Family Singers\", a change suggested by their booking agent Frederick Christian Schang. After living for a short time in Philadelphia and then Merion, Pennsylvania, where their youngest child Johannes was born, the family settled in Stowe, Vermont, in 1941. They purchased a  farm in 1942 and converted it into the Trapp Family Lodge, initially called \"Cor Unum\" (Latin for One Heart). After World War II, they founded the Trapp Family Austrian Relief fund, which sent food and clothing to people impoverished in Austria. By now based permanently in the United States, the family performed their unique mixture of liturgical music, madrigals, folk music and instrumentals to audiences in over 30 countries for the next 20 years. They made a series of 78-rpm records for RCA Victor in the 1950s, some of which were later issued on RCA Camden LPs. There were also a few later recordings released on LPs, including some stereo sessions. The family singing group disbanded in 1957.\n\nParagraph 29: Natalie Craig writing for The Sydney Morning Herald said Toadie was always destined for greatness. She said as a teenager he was a \"major ratbag with a major mullet to match\", but a genius at the same time. Craig opined many \"memorable Toadie moments\" occurred when he shared his home. She cited her favourite ever scene as being one in which Toadie, Joel and Lance had a stand-off over the washing up. Toadie was placed at number six on the Huffpost's \"35 greatest Neighbours characters of all time\" feature. Journalist Adam Beresford described him as an \"Aussie everyman\" with a \"disastrous\" love life; adding he is a \"prime example\" of the joy long-term featured characters give viewers. Beresford described his transformation from \"class clown\" to lawyer after he \"ditched the Hawaiian shirts and the greasy ponytail.\" The critic concluded that Toadie \"earned his place among the Neighbours greats.\" In 2022, Kate Randall from Heat included Toadie in the magazine's top ten Neighbours characters of all time feature. Randall opined that Toadie had \"come a long way\" to become a lawyer. She described him as once being a \"ratbag with long hair and loud Hawaiian shirts.\" She added that Toadie and Stonefish \"wreaked havoc\" on Ramsay Street. Toadie was placed first in a poll ran via soap fansite \"Back To The Bay\", which asked readers to determine the top ten most popular Neighbours characters. In response the Daily Mirror's Susan Knox assessed that Toadie \"has faced endless trials and tribulations\". In an Irish Independent feature profiling \"the top 12 Neighbours icons\", Sheena McGinley titled Toadie as the most iconic. McGinley assessed that \"Toadie's been many things \u2014 cheeky, caring, seemingly gifted in the bedroom department, a lawyer, and a dad.\" She continued to list his many stories but noted his comic persona. McGinley concluded that his comedy \"is why he's the most multi-faceted, relatable character to ever grace the street.\" Lorna White from Yours profiled the magazine's \"favourite Neighbours characters of all time\". Toadie was included in the list and White stated that he had \"become a hugely popular character in the series.\" A reporter from The Scotsman included Toadie and Sonya's wedding day explosion as one of the show's top five moments in its entire history. Toadie and Dee's wedding was placed at number five in a feature compiled for The Guardian, celebrating the show's most memorable moments. Critic Sam Strutt also likened Dee and Toadie's romance to the tale of the Beauty and the Beast.\n\nParagraph 30: In 1997 they released their debut full-length album Under the Western Freeway through Will, and, with the help of Howe Gelb, signed a UK deal with Big Cat Records\u00a0\u2013 by then a subsidiary of Richard Branson's V2 Records\u00a0\u2013 who reissued the album the following year. The album included the single \"A.M. 180\", which was featured during a sequence in the 2002 British film 28 Days Later. It was also used for the theme song for the BBC Four television series Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe (9 years later, Screenwipe debuted in 2006), and in an advertisement for Colin Murray's BBC Radio 1 show. \"A.M. 180\" was also used in television commercials for the Dodge Journey automobile. One of the album's singles, \"Summer Here Kids\", was rated as \"Single of the Week\" by popular British music magazine NME, and was also used as the theme music for another Charlie Brooker-fronted show, BBC Radio 4's So Wrong It's Right. The album led to an increase in the band's popularity in Europe, and a main stage performance at the Reading Festival in 1998. The album was only a success in the US when later reissued by V2. With the band busy touring in 1999, their next release was the compilation The Broken Down Comforter Collection.", "answers": ["Paragraph 15"], "pred": "2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,", "length": 8525, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f440b317fe84ec87132b316031ad47925a6ae33e0ef0ee3a"}

When the series ended in 2002, DiCamillo was featured in Bam Margera's film Haggard: The Movie, which DiCamillo also co-wrote. He then starred in Margera's Viva La Bam reality television show, which ran from 2003 to 2005. He co-starred in his own show with Rake Yohn called Blastazoid, which only lasted two episodes until MTV canceled the show due to dispute between MTV and the makers of the show. DiCamillo then appeared in Bam Margera's Bam's Unholy Union TV series. In 2008, he starred in Chris Raab's short film Hotdog Casserole. In 2009, he starred in Margera's Minghags.\n\nParagraph 2: Despite a one-night stand with Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) in January 1994, Ricky does not enter into another serious relationship until August, when he begins dating Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). They move in together, but when Bianca begins to treat Ricky badly, he begins an affair with her best friend Natalie Price (Lucy Speed), in 1995. Natalie falls in love with Ricky and sets it up so that Bianca catches them kissing. Furious, Bianca finishes with Ricky, cutting up all his clothes and, after Ricky rejects Natalie, she flees Walford. Bianca eventually forgives Ricky and they reunite. Bianca strays with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), but immediately realises her mistake and marries Ricky on 17 April 1997. Later that year Bianca falls pregnant, but a prenatal scan reveals her unborn baby has both spina bifida and hydrocephalus; the Butchers decide to terminate the pregnancy. The trauma devastates them both, but it does bring them closer and in September 1998 Bianca discovers she has fallen pregnant again, resulting in her prematurely giving birth to their son Liam on Christmas Day 1998. The following year, Ricky becomes acquainted with Bianca's mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and her boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). He quickly gets along with the pair, but this changes when Carol tells him that Bianca and Dan have embarked on an affair - as the pair had previously had a relationship in Spain, prior to Dan falling in love with Carol. When the affair becomes public knowledge, the Butchers' marriage ends and Bianca departs with Liam for Manchester. Ricky, devastated by his marriage breakdown, begins to clash with Dan when the latter taunts him - as well as becoming unhappy with his own life and work. This escalates when Ricky learns that Phil has recently befriended Dan, who later tells Ricky that Phil and Roy have been working together on a motor scam. In response, Ricky confronts Phil and the two have an argument as Ricky attempts to leave Walford. Phil apologizes to Ricky for hurting him and promises that he'll deal with Dan for him. Ricky initially agrees to return to Walford, but secretly leaves without Phil's consent.\n\nParagraph 3: At Brega a pro-Gadaffi Mirage F-1ED fighter jet was shot down by the rebel forces on 2 March 2011, thus leaving just one Mirage F-1BD trainer aircraft in possession of Gadaffi's loyalist forces, while that same day one pro-Gadaffi SU-22M-3K was damaged by rebel anti-aircraft fire at Brega (the rebel sources claimed that they shot it down). Several more pro-Gadaffi helicopters and fighter jets were reportedly shot down by rebel forces during the fight for Brega between 2 March and 3 March, however this claims remain uncomfirmed. Several days later, on 4 March, one abandoned pro-Gadaffi Mi-8MT air ambulance helicopter serial number \"2119\" was captured by rebel forces at Ra's Lanuf airfield. Also, on 5 March 2011, rebels shot down near Ra's Lanuf a pro-Gadaffi Su-24MK bomber, serial number \"38\" of the 1124th Libyan air force squadron with a ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft gun (both pilots were killed), and then the next day, rebels also shot down a pro-Gadaffi helicopter (either a Mi-8 or Mi-24) near Ra's Lanuf with a ZPU-4 anti-aircraft gun. Three more pro-Gadaffi fighter jets (two of them Su-22 fighter bombers\u2014their pilots were captured, reportedly being Syrian and Sudanese mercenaries) and two more pro-Gadaffi helicopters (either Mi-8 or Mi-24) were reportedly shot down by rebel forces during the fight for Ra's Lanuf between 5 March and 7 March, however these claims remain uncomfirmed. Exactly how many and what types of aircraft have been shot down were not confirmed by Jamahiriya government or independent sources. Using air power, the Libyan military checked the opposition advance westwards, towards Bin Jawad in early March. By 11 March, the pro-Gadaffi air force was running out of quality jet fuel, and attempts were made to bribe Maltese Air Force officials in order to purchase more fuel. On 13 March, Ali Atiyya, a colonel of the Libyan People's Air Force at the Mitiga military airport, near Tripoli, announced that he had defected and joined the revolution, and this is the earliest case of Libyan air force personnel defecting to the opposition. Very quickly defections have started to have effect on pro-Gadaffi air force\u2014according to the opposition sources, hundreds of pilots, technicians and ground personnel have defected to the opposition during the first half of March. On the same day, on 13 March 2011, according to the news published on 20 March by the opposition media wing Al Manara Media, pilot Muhammad Mokhtar Osman crashed his fighter jet, an MiG-23BN, on Bab al-Azizia compound in Tripoli in an apparent kamikaze-style suicide attack on pro-Gadaffi military high command, in which Khamis Gadaffi was heavily wounded and died from his wounds a week later on 20 March; however, this news wasn't confirmed by any independent sources and was right away denied by pro-Gadaffi media wing, and was finally confirmed to be misinformation when on 9 June a captured pro-Gadaffi loyalist soldier in Misrata told the rebel forces that he personally saw that Khamis Gadaffi was alive and well, leading his soldiers in Zliten.\n\nParagraph 4: Where'd You Go? is an EP by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones released in 1991 by Taang! Records. It features the title track, \"Where'd You Go?\" which also appeared on their 1992 LP, More Noise and Other Disturbances. The video for the song was shot in Boston and received minor MTV airplay. The EP also features cover versions of Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion\", Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\", and Van Halen's  \"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\", the last of which was ranked the 27th best punk cover song  by Paste in 2017. The EP also has an updated version of \"Do Something Crazy\", which previously appeared on The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' debut album, Devil's Night Out. In 2008 a rerecorded version of Where'd You Go? recorded by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones was released as a playable song for the game Rock Band 2.\n\nParagraph 5: Darwin had no success with conventional treatments. In 1849, after about four months of incessant vomiting he took up the recommendation of his friend Captain Sulivan and cousin Fox to try the water therapy regimen at Dr James Gully's Water Cure Establishment at Malvern. He read Gully's book, which provided case histories and had a price list at the back. Darwin rented a villa at Malvern for his family and started a two-month trial of the treatment on 10 March. Gully agreed with Darwin's self-diagnosis of nervous dyspepsia and set him a routine including being heated by a spirit lamp until dripping with perspiration, then vigorous rubbing with cold wet towels and cold foot baths, a strict diet, and walks. Darwin enjoyed the attention and the demanding regime which left him no time to feel guilty about not working. His health improved rapidly, and he felt that the water cure was \"no quackery\". He had no faith in the homeopathic medicines Gully gave him three times a day but took them obediently. They stayed on until 30 June, and back home at Down House, he continued with the diet and with the water treatment aided by his butler. He followed the rules about rising early and rationing his working time and had the Sandwalk constructed in the grounds for his walking exercise, setting a routine which he continued.\n\nParagraph 6: Alternative versions of two episodes exist and have been commercially released. An early edit of \"Arrival\", with a different music score and additional dialogue and scenes not in the broadcast version, was located in the 2000s and released to DVD in 2002 as a standalone disc, and then on Network's 2007 40th anniversary DVD and BluRay sets in the UK and in 2009 in the A&E Home Video DVD and Blu-ray box sets. This alternative version was located on a near-pristine 35mm print and has been transferred in high-definition along with the 17 episodes for the Blu-ray release. An early edit of \"The Chimes of Big Ben\", again with an unbroadcast music score and additional scenes and dialogue not in the broadcast version, was located in the 1980s and initially released on VHS videotape by MPI Home Video. It was later included as a bonus feature on both the 2007 Network set and the A&E Home Video DVD release of the series in the early 2000s. In 2009 it was also included in the expanded A&E Home Video box set, but owing to the low quality of the print it was not upgraded to high definition as was \"Arrival\", and was instead included as a bonus on the set's standard DVD extras disc, which was included in both the DVD and Blu-ray editions.\n\nParagraph 7: \"Too Little Too Late\" was one of the first prospective songs from the album that Herbert played for JoJo. The singer claims she wanted to record the song as soon as she heard it for the first time, elaborating, \"When my team heard that song, they knew I could hit the sweet spot, musically and in terms of subject matter.\" According to Vibe, the overall more mature, personal sentiment of the album prompted her to record \"Too Little Too Late\", having experienced both her first love and first heartbreak since the release of her self-titled debut album. The song was recorded at both Cryptic Studios in Los Angeles, California and Sony Music Studios in New York, New York. The songwriters got along both with JoJo and her mother Diana Levesque, who is also her manager, so well that they later returned to the studio to co-write a second song for the album with JoJo herself, entitled \"How to Touch a Girl\". In regards his musical style, JoJo described Steinberg as \"more of a classic writer and producer.\" Having previously written several successful singles throughout the 1980s and 1990s for artists such as Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, The Bangles, Whitney Houston and Heart, Steinberg, aged 56 at the time, realized he is older than JoJo (15) and Alexander (24) combined while working in the recording studio with the two younger artists but didn't find it difficult to write lyrics appropriate for them, explaining, \"I think that the part of me that writes lyrics isn\u2019t really old or young ... I think the lyrics flow out in a way that has an honesty to it.\" On the difference between writing for younger versus older artists, Steinberg explained \"you don't really know it's for somebody younger ... I've almost never really sat down and said, 'I'm going to try to write one that would be good for somebody younger.' I just write a song, and then if somebody younger likes it, then they sing it.\"\n\nParagraph 8: For the invocation of a procedure (or function) with parameters, their type will be known (they being declared before use) but their usage in the procedure invocation may not be. Fortran for example passes all parameters by reference (i.e. by address) so there is no immediate difficulty with generating the code (as always, with actual addresses to be fixed up later), but Pascal and other languages allow parameters to be passed by different methods at the programmer's choice (by reference, or by value, or even perhaps by \"name\") and this is signified only in the definition of the procedure, which is unknown before the definition has been encountered. Specifically for Pascal, in the specification of parameters a prefix \"Var\" signifies that it must be received by reference, its absence signifies by value. In the first case the compiler must generate code that passes the address of the parameter, while in the second it must generate different code that passes a copy of the value, usually via a stack. As always, a \"fixup\" mechanism could be invoked to deal with this, but it would be very messy. Multi-pass compilers can of course collate all the required information as they shuttle back and forth, but single-pass compilers cannot. Code generation could be paused while the scan advances (and its results be held in internal storage) until such time as the needed entity is encountered, and this might not be regarded as resulting in a second pass through the source because the code generation stage will soon catch up, it was merely halting for a while. But this would be complex. Instead a special construction is introduced, whereby the procedure's definition of parameter usage is declared \"forward\" of its later full definition so that the compiler may know it before use, as it requires.\n\nParagraph 9: Williams came into the Australian Open unseeded, because of her world no. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as \"out of shape\". Williams in her opening match faced 27th seed Mara Santangelo and lost only three games, with the help of ten aces. In her next match she faced qualifier Anne Kremer, which she had to break back when she was broken in the fifth game to push it to a tie-break. Kramer took four of the first five points, before Williams could win the last six to take the breaker. Williams then took the first four games of the second and eventually closed it out in the eight game. In the round of 32, Williams had 5th seed Nadia Petrova on the other side of the net. Petrova dominated the first set losing only a game and served for the match in the tenth game of the second. However, Williams broke back and won the next two games to take the second set when Petrova double faulted. Williams then took the deciding set with a single break lead, serving it out in the ninth game. This was her first win over a top-10 player since defeating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 Australian Open final. In the fourth round, she faced 11th ranked Jelena Jankovi\u0107 and cruised in straight sets with a drop of only five games. Williams fired eight aces to go with 31 winners and 28 errors. This is her first time since the 2005 Australian Open to get past the fourth round of a slam. In the last eight, she took on Shahar Pe'er. Pe'er broke in the first game and held the led through closing it out in the ninth game. Williams then took the last four games of the second set form the fifth game to take it to a decider. Williams broke in the fourth game, just for Pe'er to break back and get back on serve latter in the set. Pe'er then broke in the eleventh game and served for the match; Williams then broke back and won the next two games to go through. Williams had 49 unforced errors and only 30 winners. In the final 4, Williams faced 17-year-old Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1. The first went to a tie-break in which Williams took the first four points then Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1 rallied to tie it at 5, Williams then took the next two points to take the set. Williams then broke Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1 twice and served for the match at the eight game, Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1 came back and broke and saved four match points on her own serve to hold. Williams then served it out in the tenth game. Tracy Austin in her tournament analysis stated that Williams had a great tournament but the ride was over and that Maria Sharapova would have no trouble with Williams. Serena thought it was mean and unnecessary and used it as motivation. In the first set, Williams took the first five games before Sharapova could get a game, Williams then held to close out the set. Williams then made four games in a row in the second before Sharapova could win a game, Williams served it out in the eight game and won the match. This is her first title at any tournament since winning the 2005 Australian Open. Williams finished with 28 winners and 11 unforced errors. Williams came the first player since Chris O'Neil to win the title whilst not being seeded; and claimed her third Australian Open and eighth Grand Slam singles title overall. The win elevated Williams to 14th in the rankings. Williams dedicated the title to her deceased sister Yetunde Price.  Her performance in the final was described in the press as \"one of the best performances of her career\" and \"arguably the most powerful display ever seen in women's tennis.\"\n\nParagraph 10: Similar to the atrium, the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the left ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body. With respect to thermoregulation, the American flamingo has highly vascularized feet that use a countercurrent exchange system in their legs and feet. This method of thermoregulation keeps a constant gradient between the veins and arteries that are in close proximity in order to maintain heat within the core and minimize heat loss or gain in the extremities. Heat loss is minimized while wading in cold water, while heat gain is minimized in the hot temperatures during rest and flight.\n\nParagraph 11: Another mimic variant appears in the Forgotten Realms setting boxed set, The Ruins of Undermountain II: The Deep Levels (1994), in the set's 16-page Monstrous Compendium booklet. Stated to be found only in the setting's Undermountain thus far, the greater mimic is vastly larger than a common mimic and can cover a whole room or a small building such as a tomb; the largest known specimen can cover a  cubic area. A greater mimic has a higher intelligence than a common mimic, and a limited resistance to magic, and \"can alter its coloring and shape to imitate a vast number of textures, colors, and shapes at once... [creating] entire rooms of furniture, treasure and tapestries.\" A greater mimic can block a corridor and alter its shape to become a room with entrance doors on either side, so that its prey walks directly into it; a greater mimic will always use enticements such as simulated treasure or furniture to lure prey, and will wait until an entire group enters before attacking. A greater mimic will then release its natural adhesive across all its surfaces and attack by slamming the walls of its structure together. A minority of greater mimics can develop an ability to display illusory creatures inside itself, pretending to speak through these creatures' mouths. This mutation of the common mimic, according to its entry in this boxed set, is presumed to be the result of either a mimic having lived for a century and grown to great size, or perhaps a mimic altered by the strange magic of Undermountain and the wizards that reside there. A greater mimic is unlikely to obey a wizard, although Halaster is able to use these creatures as guards and barriers against adventurers. A greater mimic has limited mobility to due its size, and will usually settle in one place. A greater mimic makes pacts with other local creatures for food, but can sustain itself on little or no food for long periods of time if need be; a greater mimic has a prodigious appetite, however, and does not practice conservation if a steady supply of food is available. A greater mimic appears in this boxed set's Campaign Guide booklet, as part of the \"Muiral's Gauntlet\" scenario, living in an abandoned drow complex. When encountered by player characters, this greater mimic covers most of the floor in an apparent storeroom filled with boxes of coins and valuables; if it appears to be losing a fight against the characters, it will negotiate, trading information for its life. The greater mimic's entry is reprinted in the Monstrous Compendium Annual Two (1995), although no mention is made there of Undermountain.\n\nParagraph 12: The work of Catholic nun and missionary Anjez\u00eb Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, commonly known as Mother Teresa and from 2016 as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, received mixed reactions from prominent people, governments, and organisations. Her practices, and those of the Missionaries of Charity, the order which she founded, were subject to numerous controversies. These include objections to the quality of medical care which they provided, suggestions that some deathbed baptisms constituted forced conversion, and alleged links to colonialism and racism and to relations to questionable public figures. The controversy extends to include the large sums of money donated to her as well as the Vatican for ignoring the criticisms raised.\n\nParagraph 13: Most fields of studies have a founding father, such as Newton in physics and Lavoisier in chemistry. Materials science on the other hand has no central figure that set in motion materials studies. In the 1940s, wartime collaborations of multiple fields of study to produce technological advances became a structure to the future field of study that would become known as material science and engineering. During the Cold War in the 1950s, US President Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) made materials a priority, when it realized that materials were the limiting factor for advances in space and military technology. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), referred to as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) since 1996. In 1960, ARPA encouraged the establishment of interdisciplinary laboratories (IDL's) on university campuses, which would be dedicated to the research of materials, as well as to the education of students on how to conduct materials science research.  ARPA offered 4 year IDL contracts to universities, originally to Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, and Northwestern University, eventually granting nine more contracts. Although ARPA is no longer in control of the IDL program (the National Science Foundation took over the program in 1972 ), the original establishment of IDL's marked a significant milestone in the United States' research and development of materials science. Several institutions departments changed titles from \"metallurgy\" to \"metallurgy and materials science\" in the 1960s.\n\nParagraph 14: DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix is the 6th game in the Dance Dance Revolution series of music video games. It was released in the arcades by Konami on October 19, 2001, and for the PlayStation 2 on May 16, 2002, in Japan. 6thMix contains a total of 42 songs, all which made their first arcade appearance on this release. 11 of these songs debuted in various console releases prior to 6thMix. All arcade songs from Dance Dance Revolution to Dance Dance Revolution 5thMix were removed in 6thMix, although many of the Konami originals from those games would later be revived in future arcade releases.\n\nParagraph 15: In 1824, British Governor Sir Charles MacCarthy, was defeated by the Ashanti army, committed suicide, and his skull was taken back to the Ashanti capital Kumasi where it was reportedly used as a drinking cup. George Maclean was President of the Committee of Merchants at Cape Coast Castle from 1830 until 1844, a period when a President rather than a Governor ruled the British in the Gold Coast. In October 1836 he met the poet Letitia Landon at a dinner party while on a visit to the UK. They married and traveled back to Cape Coast Castle where, within two months, Landon died of heart failure. Both Maclean and Landon are buried in the castle courtyard. Maclean was charged with putting an end to slave trading and did so along  of the West African coast. However his reputation was muddied by his willingness to support the ownership of slaves within the vicinity of Cape Coast Castle. As such he was demoted to Judicial Assessor and maintained for his extensive local knowledge and commitment to trade. He also made peace with the Ashanti (Treaty of 1831), instituted a judicial system still in use in many African democracies, and encouraged successful and fair trading.  From 1846\u20131850, Governor William Winniett was also active in ending the slave trade. He died in the Fortress.\n\nParagraph 16: Owing to its location on the immediate leeward side of the Andes, Esquel has a cool summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csb) bordering on a Humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dsb).  Other climate systems, such as the Trewartha climate classification, place it within the oceanic zone (Do), like much of Western Europe and the Pacific Northwest. Temperatures are relatively cold for its climate due to its higher altitude. Summers are mild with warm temperatures during the afternoon followed by cool nights. The mean temperature during the summer is around . It's the sunniest season, averaging as much as 10 hours of sunshine per day in January with an average of 7\u20138 clear days and only 5-7 overcast days. Spring and fall are transition seasons featuring mild temperatures during the day and cool to cold nights. Spring starts out with cool temperatures during the day and very cold nights which progressively becomes warmer. Both spring and fall have highly variable weather. \n\nParagraph 17: The wave theory of social development holds that intense periods of social activity are followed by periods of remission, in which the activists involved intensely in mobilization are systematically marginalized and isolated. After the intense period fighting for women's suffrage, the common interest which had united international feminists left the women's movement without a single focus upon which all could agree. Ideological differences between radicals and moderates, led to a split and a period of deradicalization, with the largest group of women's activists spearheading movements to educate women on their new responsibilities as voters. Organizations like the African National Congress Women's League, the Irish Housewives Association, the League of Women Voters, the Townswomen's Guilds and the Women's Institutes supported women and tried to educate them on how to use their new rights to incorporate themselves into the established political system. Still other organizations, involved in the mass movement of women into the workforce during World War I and World War II and their subsequent exit at the end of the war with concerted official efforts to return to family life, turned their efforts to labor issues. The World YWCA and Zonta International, were leaders in these efforts, mobilizing women to gather information on the situation of working women and organize assistance programs. Increasingly, radical organizations, like the American National Women's Party, were marginalized by media which denounced feminism and its proponents as \"severe neurotics responsible for the problems of\" society. Those who were still attached to the radical themes of equality were typically unmarried, employed, socially and economically advantaged and seemed to the larger society to be deviant.\n\nParagraph 18: Male, female. Forewing length 3.8-4.0\u00a0mm. Head: frons shining ochreous-white with greenish and reddish reflections, vertex and neck tufts shining dark greyish brown with reddish gloss, lined white laterally and medially, collar shining dark greyish brown; labial palpus first segment very short, white, second segment three-quarters of the length of third, dark brown with white longitudinal lines laterally and ventrally, third segment white, lined brown laterally, extreme apex white; scape dorsally shining dark brown with a white anterior line, ventrally shining white; antenna shining dark brown with a white line from base to one-half, in apical half two white rings of two segments separated by two dark brown segments, followed towards apex by six dark brown and eight white segments at apex.

Hindwing shining brownish grey, cilia ochreous-brown. Underside: forewing shining brownish grey, white apical line visible in the cilia, hindwing shining pale grey. Abdomen dorsally shining yellowish brown with reddish gloss, segment six banded whitish posteriorly, ventrally shining white, anal tuft ochreous.\n\nParagraph 19: The origin of their literature dates to 1563, when the first Konkani grammar was published by Fr Andre Vaz at St Paulo College at Old Goa. In 1567 the first Konkani-Portuguese dictionary was published by missionary priests at Rachol, Goa. In 1622 Thomas Stephens, an English Jesuit, published  Doutrina Christam em Lingoa Bramana Canarim (Christian Doctrines in the Canarese Brahmin Language), which was the first book in Konkani and any Indian language. On 22 December 1821 the first periodical, Gazeta de Goa (Goa Gazetteer), edited by Antonio Jose de Lima Leitao, was published. On 22 January 1900 the first Portuguese newspaper, O Heraldo, was started by Prof. Messias Gomes. It was transformed into an English daily in 1987. Periodicals such as Amcho Ganv (1930) by Luis de Menezes, Vauraddeancho Ixxt (1933), a weekly by Fr. Arcencio Fernandes and Fr. Gracianco Moraes, Aitarachem Vachop, a Konkani weekly run by the Salesians, and Gulab by Fr. Freddy J. da Costa were published in Goa. Konkani-Portuguese periodicals such as O Concani, a weekly by Sebasti\u0101o Jesus Dias, Sanjechem Noketr (The Evening Star) (1907) by B.F. Cabral, O Goano (1907) by Honarato Furtado and Francis Futardo, and Ave Maria (1919) edited by Antonio D'Cruz were published in Bombay. In February 1899 Udentenchem Sallok (Lotus of the East) by Eduardo J. Bruno de Souza, the first Konkani periodical, was published as a fortnightly in Poona. The first Konkani book in the Devanagri script, Kristanv Doton ani Katisism by Dr. George Octaviano Pires, was published in Sholapore in 1894. Fr. Ludovico Pereria's monthly Dor Mhoineachi Rotti (Monthly Bread) was published in Karachi in 1915. In 1911 the first Konkani novel, Kristanv Ghorabo (Christian Home), was published. Modern literature is diverse and includes themes such as historical awakening in Lambert Mascarenhas' Sorrowing Lies My Land, feminism in Maria Aurora Couto's Goa: A Daughters' Story, and fantasy in Nandita da Cunha's The Magic of Maya. In 1974, the Archdiocese of Goa and Daman published the Novo Korar (New Testament) of the Holy Bible in Konkani. Later, on 4 June 2006, the Archdiocese released the complete Catholic Bible in Konkani employing the Latin alphabet known as Povitr Pustok. In 2018, Archbishop of Goa and Daman Filipe Neri Ferrao launched the Povitr Pustok, a Konkani Bible app, a mobile phone application software with the entire Konkani Bible text.\n\nParagraph 20: The fineness of a precious metal object (coin, bar, jewelry, etc.) represents the weight of fine metal therein, in proportion to the total weight which includes alloying base metals and any impurities. Alloy metals are added to increase hardness and durability of coins and jewelry, alter colors, decrease the cost per weight, or avoid the cost of high-purity refinement. For example, copper is added to the precious metal silver to make a more durable alloy for use in coins, housewares and jewelry. Coin silver, which was used for making silver coins in the past, contains 90% silver and 10% copper, by mass. Sterling silver contains 92.5% silver and 7.5% of other metals, usually copper, by mass.\n\nParagraph 21: It has a snout rather acuminate, as long as the distance between the eye and the upper border of the ear-opening, 1.3 the diameter of the orbit; forehead concave; interorbital space very narrow; upper eyelid strongly fringed; ear-opening large, obliquely crescentic, the concavity being directed forwards and upwards, its diameter equalling three fourths that of the eye. Body and limbs moderate. Digits free, moderately dilated, inner well developed; infradigital lamellae obliquely curved; 10 lamellae under the thumb, 10 under the third finger, 9 under the inner toe, and 12 under the third toe. Snout covered with large convex granular scales, largest between the eye and the nostril; hinder part of head with minute granules, and scattered ones of a larger size. Rostral four times as broad as deep (having fused with the anterior labial on each side); nostril above the rostral, between the latter and three nasals; 10 or 11 upper and 9 lower labials; mental large, triangular, twice as long as the adjacent labial, its point between two large chin-shields which are in contact behind it; a small chin-shield on each side of the large pair. Upper surface of body covered -with small irregular flat grannies and moderately large, trihedral, strongly keeled tubercles arranged in 14 or 16 rather irregular longitudinal series; the largest tubercles measure about one fourth the diameter of the eye. Abdominal scales small, smooth, rounded, imbricate. Male with a shore angular series of 8 preanal pores. Tail cylindrical, tapering, covered above with small, irregular, imbricate smooth scales and scattered pointed tubercles forming four or six longitudinal series, beneath with a series of transversely dilated plates. Pale yellowish brown, with six faint brownish transverse narrow dorsal bands, the tubercles in these areas being almost black; a dark brown streak from the nostrils through the eye above the ear, with a whitish line above it; lips whitish.\n\nParagraph 22: The Bangladesh Navy was created as part of Bangladesh Forces during Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan. Its official creation date is July 1971 during the Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971. In 1971, with West Pakistan imposing a brutal military crackdown in East Pakistan, the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, PADMA and PALASH, and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small patrol vessels, was inaugurated. These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the Indian Air Force on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on Mongla seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.\n\nParagraph 23: In February, 1964, Wilkinson announced that he would enter a special election to replace his friend, the late Robert S. Kerr, as U. S. Senator from Oklahoma. He had already resigned his position as head coach of the Oklahoma University Sooners.   Politicians and the Oklahoma press debated whether he was qualified to become a U. S. Senator, though all seemed to agree that his popularity as a cultural icon gave him an important edge. Easily winning the Republican primary, Wilkinson became the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1964, at which point he legally changed his first name to Bud, but narrowly lost to Democrat Fred R. Harris, then a State Senator in Oklahoma. Both parties involved political heavyweights from out of state to campaign for their candidates. Republicans invited former President Eisenhower and Senator Barry Goldwater. Illness made Eisenhower miss the occasion, so his former Vice President Richard Nixon served as substitute. Harris supporters got President Lyndon Johnson to make an appearance, as well as several other national Democrats. Wilkinson's Republican advisers brought in Senator Strom Thurmond to appeal to ultra-conservative voters in Little Dixie, which had recently turned reliably Republican. That effort backfired. Harris later said, \"my campaign got an extra benefit from Senator Thurmond's Oklahoma visit \u2026 Thurmond wound up scaring the daylights out of even a lot of conservative white voters with his jingoist speeches, advocating for the escalation of the American war effort in Vietnam.\" In the 1964 General Election, Republican presidential nominee, Senator Barry Goldwater lost to incumbent President Lyndon Baines Johnson 55-45 percent in Oklahoma. Through 2020, Johnson is the last Democrat to carry Oklahoma in a presidential election. Wilkinson entertained seeking the other Oklahoma U.S. Senate seat in 1968, but he did not run, and the position went to former Governor Henry Bellmon, also a Republican.\n\nParagraph 24: Livy's account of the struggles of Gaius Licinius and Lucius Sextius and their legislation on the consulship has been analysed by T.J. Cornell. He thinks that very little of Livy's narrative can be accepted. However, its institutional changes are \"reasonably certain.\" He argues that the significance of the law on the consulship is unclear and its background is \"extremely puzzling\" due to obscurity around the military tribunes with consular power. Livy wrote that they had been instituted because it was decided that in some years the consulship should be replaced by the consular tribunes (whose numbers varied from three to six), that this office would be open to plebeians and that it had been created as a concession to the plebeians who wanted access to the consulship. However, from 444 BC (the year of the first consular tribunes) to 401 BC there were only two plebeian consular tribunes (out of a total of 100).  For the 400-376 BC period, in 400, 399 and 396 BC the majority of these tribunes were plebeians (4, 5, and 5 out of 6, respectively) and in 379 BC there were three plebeians of six. This raises some questions. Why from 444 to 401 BC were there only two plebeians? Why, given the presence of plebeians in the subsequent period, which shows their eligibility to the highest office, was plebeian access to the consulship considered such a landmark for the political promotion of the plebeians? Why was there such resistance to this? The sources seem to see the law as a breakthrough not just because it provided access to the consulship, but because it required that one of the two consuls each year be a patrician. However, during one twelve-year period after the passage of the laws, from 355 to 343 BC, both consuls were patricians and the consulship became an unbroken line of shared office only after that.\n\nParagraph 25: Mickey Smith is first introduced in the series' 2005 reboot premi\u00e8re episode, \"Rose\". When Mickey's girlfriend Rose (Billie Piper) begins investigating a mysterious alien called the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), Mickey is captured by the alien Nestene Consciousness, from which a living plastic facsimile of him (an 'auton') is created. Mickey, terrified by the revelation that alien life exists, fails to impress the Doctor, who only invites Rose to be his travelling companion in time and space. In the year since Rose absconded with the Doctor, Mickey has been the prime suspect for Rose's disappearance and has become distressed as a result. However, he assists the pair in defeating the Slitheen, a family of extraterrestrial criminals; using his computer hacking skills, he commandeers a military harpoon missile which he targets at 10 Downing Street to kill the Slitheen. Mickey then declines an invitation from the Doctor to join him and Rose in the TARDIS. A much younger Mickey, played by Casey Dyer, appears briefly when Rose attempts to alter her childhood in \"Father's Day\". In \"Boom Town\", Mickey later meets up with the Doctor, Rose and new companion Captain Jack (John Barrowman) in Cardiff, where he helps them foil a Slitheen plot. In the series' finale episode \"The Parting of the Ways\", when Rose becomes stranded at home at the Powell Estate, Mickey uses a recovery truck to crack open the TARDIS's console, through which Rose is able to absorb the time vortex and save the universe from an invasion of the hateful mutant alien Daleks.\n\nParagraph 26: The establishment of the Portuguese on the Western coast of India was of particular interest to the New Christians population of Portugal who were suffering harshly under the Portuguese Inquisition. The crypto-Jewish targets of the Inquisition in Portugal began flocking to Goa, and their community reached considerable proportions. India was attractive for Jews who had been forcibly baptized in Portugal for a variety of reasons. One reason was that India was home to ancient, well-established Jewish communities. Jews who had been forcibly converted could approach these communities, and re-join their former faith if they chose to do so, without having to fear for their lives as these areas were beyond the scope of the Inquisition. Another reason was the opportunity to engage in trade (spices, diamonds, etc) from which New Christians in Portugal had been restricted at the onset of the Portuguese Inquisition. In his book, The Marrano Factory, Professor Antonio Saraiva of the University of Lisbon details the strength of the New Christians on the economic front by quoting a 1613 document written by attorney, Martin de Zellorigo. Zellorigo writes regarding \"the Men of the Nation\" (a term used for Jewish New Christians): \"For in all of Portugal there is not a single merchant (hombre de negocios) who is not of this Nation. These people have their correspondents in all lands and domains of the king our lord. Those of Lisbon send kinsmen to the East Indies to establish trading-posts where they receive the exports from Portugal, which they barter for merchandise in demand back home. They have outposts in the Indian port cities of Goa and Cochin and in the interior. In Lisbon and in India nobody can handle the trade in merchandise except persons of this Nation. Without them, His Majesty will no longer be able to make a go of his Indian possessions, and will lose the 600,000 ducats a year in duties which finance the whole enterprise \u2013 from equipping the ships to paying the seamen and soldiers\" The Portuguese reaction to the New Christians in India came in the form of bitter letters of complaint and polemics that were written, and sent to Portugal by secular and ecclesiastical authorities; these complaints were about trade practices, and the abandonment of Catholicism. In particular, the first archbishop of Goa Dom Gaspar de Leao Pereira, was extremely critical of the New Christian presence, and was highly influential in petitioning for the establishment of the Inquisition in Goa.\n\nParagraph 27: The songwriting process for California was much less collaborative than the band's previous albums. Despite having a more accessible sound than prior releases, saxophonist Clinton McKinnon has stated, \"It wasn\u2019t some attempt at reconciling how much we\u2019d previously tortured our audiences with white-noise [...] it wasn\u2019t some conscious attempt to normalise our music or make it all the more palatable.\" On the album's writing and sound, Trevor Dunn stated in a 2017 interview that, \"[we] never discussed our projected direction. We never sat down and said, 'ok the last record was like that so now let\u2019s attempt this.' Instead we individually brought things to the collective table that somehow coalesced without premeditation.\" He goes on to state that \"the recording of California was a bit of a nightmare. We attempted frugality by recording a lot in our rehearsal space which [our guitarist] Trey [Spruance] had partially turned into a recording studio.  But we also spread the work out over various outside studios with a number of engineers as well as additional musicians.  In the end we had two 24-track tape machines and two ADAT machines linked. That record would have been much easier to manage had Pro Tools come along a bit sooner.\"\n\nParagraph 28: The monster depicted in the mural was first referred to as the \"Piasa Bird\" in an article published c. 1836 by John Russell of Bluffdale, Illinois. John Russell was a professor of Greek and Latin at Shurtleff College, Upper Alton, Illinois. The article was entitled \"The Tradition of The Piasa\" and Russell claimed the origin of the word to be from a nearby stream: \"This stream is the Piasa. Its name is Indian, and signifies, in the Illini, \"The Bird That Devours Men.\" The original Piasa Creek ran through the main ravine in downtown Alton, and was completely covered by huge drainage pipes around 1912. According to the story published by Russell, the creature depicted by the painting was a huge bird that lived in the cliffs. Russell claimed that this creature attacked and devoured people in nearby Indian villages shortly after the corpses of a war gave it a taste for human flesh. The legend claims that a local Indian chief, named Chief Ouatoga, managed to slay the monster using a plan given to him in a dream from the Great Spirit. The chief ordered his bravest warriors to hide near the entrance of the Piasa Bird's cave, which Russell also claimed to have explored. Ouatoga then acted as bait to lure the creature out into the open. As the monster flew down toward the Indian chief, his warriors slew it with a volley of poisoned arrows. Russell claimed that the mural was painted by the Indians as a commemoration of this heroic event.\n\nParagraph 29: After the invasion of Poland, the prison became part of the German District of Warsaw, in the borough, reserved for the German administration of the General Government and the German occupation army. The prison was one of several prisons of the Gestapo in Warsaw. It housed Polish politicians, freedom fighters, resistance workers and ordinary people caught in \u0142apankas on the streets of Warsaw. The site became infamous due to constant torture of the inmates. It was known as one of the places of no return (Nacht und Nebel), from which the only way out was to the execution site, or to a German concentration camp. It was also a place of detention of innocent hostages, taken by Germans as punishment for actions by the Home Army. Later they were killed in mass executions announced publicly.\n\nParagraph 30: | colspan=\"5\" |Koiwai announces the time has come to set out the kotatsu, and Yotsuba helps pick up loose items around the room. Yanda convinces Koiwai to purchase a blender, and teaches Yotsuba a simple recipe for banana smoothies. He frightens her by yelling the blender will explode, but after tasting the smoothie, Yotsuba forgives him. On their way to the seashore to collect rocks, Yotsuba and Koiwai run into Ena and Miura; the two older girls are excited to join the rock-collecting expedition. The first spot they pick turns out to be a sandy beach with few rocks, but a strange man directs them to a better location where they collect many smooth and interesting rocks. At the Ayase household, while comparing rocks with Ena, Yotsuba is lured away by the snacks Fuuka brought to her cram session with Miss Stake. Fuuka prepares a short test for Yotsuba as a break from her studies, and Miss Stake demonstrates origami for Yotsuba as well; at 4:30\u00a0pm, Yotsuba returns to her home, and the teens resume their studies, only to discover that Yotsuba has eaten all the snacks. After Yotsuba watches Ena paint a birthday card for a friend, she begs her father for a paint set, and they go to an art supply store with Jumbo. Jumbo selects a set for her and Yotsuba paints an ocean for the mermaid princess. When Yanda arrives, Jumbo and Koiwai pretend to have died as a joke. Later, Yanda sees Yotsuba's painting of the ocean and asks if he could sell it and quit his job. Yotsuba gets a haircut; the stylist offers a picture book as a distraction, but Yotsuba insists on a glossy magazine featuring sushi instead. They buy bread from a new bakery on the way home, but Yotsuba is disappointed by the lack of cream filling. Yotsuba illustrates her own picture book entitled Sunday featuring herself as the Sparkle Princess, who defeats a monster that destroyed the world, then goes to school with a backpack. In a good mood because her exams are finished, Fuuka is humming but is criticized by her sisters and mother as atonal; she is sent by her mother to the Koiwai house with apples. There, she is greeted by Yotsuba and directed to sit down for a haircut, which she selects from a book illustrated by Yotsuba that pairs foods and hair styles. Shocked that Koiwai has not purchased a backpack for Yotsuba, Fuuka coaches him to call his mother, who immediately offers to pay for it. At the store, Yotsuba chooses a red backpack and as she models it for Fuuka, Koiwai realizes that Yotsuba will start school in a few months and remembers a story he told when he went camping with Jumbo and Yanda: he didn't feel like a father until Yotsuba began talking and calling him \"Daddy\". He is overcome with emotion and Yotsuba vows to protect him, mistaking his tears for physical pain.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text discusses the challenges faced by compilers when invoking procedures with parameters in different programming languages. In Fortran, parameters are always passed by reference, making it relatively easy to generate the code. However, in languages like Pascal, parameters can be passed by different methods chosen by the programmer (by reference, by value, or by \"name\"). This information is only known at the procedure's definition, which may not be encountered before its invocation. To address this issue, a special construction called a \"forward\" declaration is introduced in Pascal. This allows the compiler to know the parameter's usage before its full definition, enabling code generation without the need for a messy fixup mechanism or multiple passes through the source code.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

They move in together, but when Bianca begins to treat Ricky badly, he begins an affair with her best friend Natalie Price (Lucy Speed), in 1995. Natalie falls in love with Ricky and sets it up so that Bianca catches them kissing. Furious, Bianca finishes with Ricky, cutting up all his clothes and, after Ricky rejects Natalie, she flees Walford. Bianca eventually forgives Ricky and they reunite. Bianca strays with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), but immediately realises her mistake and marries Ricky on 17 April 1997. Later that year Bianca falls pregnant, but a prenatal scan reveals her unborn baby has both spina bifida and hydrocephalus; the Butchers decide to terminate the pregnancy. The trauma devastates them both, but it does bring them closer and in September 1998 Bianca discovers she has fallen pregnant again, resulting in her prematurely giving birth to their son Liam on Christmas Day 1998. The following year, Ricky becomes acquainted with Bianca's mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and her boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). He quickly gets along with the pair, but this changes when Carol tells him that Bianca and Dan have embarked on an affair - as the pair had previously had a relationship in Spain, prior to Dan falling in love with Carol. When the affair becomes public knowledge, the Butchers' marriage ends and Bianca departs with Liam for Manchester. Ricky, devastated by his marriage breakdown, begins to clash with Dan when the latter taunts him - as well as becoming unhappy with his own life and work. This escalates when Ricky learns that Phil has recently befriended Dan, who later tells Ricky that Phil and Roy have been working together on a motor scam. In response, Ricky confronts Phil and the two have an argument as Ricky attempts to leave Walford. Phil apologizes to Ricky for hurting him and promises that he'll deal with Dan for him. Ricky initially agrees to return to Walford, but secretly leaves without Phil's consent.\n\nParagraph 3: At Brega a pro-Gadaffi Mirage F-1ED fighter jet was shot down by the rebel forces on 2 March 2011, thus leaving just one Mirage F-1BD trainer aircraft in possession of Gadaffi's loyalist forces, while that same day one pro-Gadaffi SU-22M-3K was damaged by rebel anti-aircraft fire at Brega (the rebel sources claimed that they shot it down). Several more pro-Gadaffi helicopters and fighter jets were reportedly shot down by rebel forces during the fight for Brega between 2 March and 3 March, however this claims remain uncomfirmed. Several days later, on 4 March, one abandoned pro-Gadaffi Mi-8MT air ambulance helicopter serial number \"2119\" was captured by rebel forces at Ra's Lanuf airfield. Also, on 5 March 2011, rebels shot down near Ra's Lanuf a pro-Gadaffi Su-24MK bomber, serial number \"38\" of the 1124th Libyan air force squadron with a ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft gun (both pilots were killed), and then the next day, rebels also shot down a pro-Gadaffi helicopter (either a Mi-8 or Mi-24) near Ra's Lanuf with a ZPU-4 anti-aircraft gun. Three more pro-Gadaffi fighter jets (two of them Su-22 fighter bombers\u2014their pilots were captured, reportedly being Syrian and Sudanese mercenaries) and two more pro-Gadaffi helicopters (either Mi-8 or Mi-24) were reportedly shot down by rebel forces during the fight for Ra's Lanuf between 5 March and 7 March, however these claims remain uncomfirmed. Exactly how many and what types of aircraft have been shot down were not confirmed by Jamahiriya government or independent sources. Using air power, the Libyan military checked the opposition advance westwards, towards Bin Jawad in early March. By 11 March, the pro-Gadaffi air force was running out of quality jet fuel, and attempts were made to bribe Maltese Air Force officials in order to purchase more fuel. On 13 March, Ali Atiyya, a colonel of the Libyan People's Air Force at the Mitiga military airport, near Tripoli, announced that he had defected and joined the revolution, and this is the earliest case of Libyan air force personnel defecting to the opposition. Very quickly defections have started to have effect on pro-Gadaffi air force\u2014according to the opposition sources, hundreds of pilots, technicians and ground personnel have defected to the opposition during the first half of March. On the same day, on 13 March 2011, according to the news published on 20 March by the opposition media wing Al Manara Media, pilot Muhammad Mokhtar Osman crashed his fighter jet, an MiG-23BN, on Bab al-Azizia compound in Tripoli in an apparent kamikaze-style suicide attack on pro-Gadaffi military high command, in which Khamis Gadaffi was heavily wounded and died from his wounds a week later on 20 March; however, this news wasn't confirmed by any independent sources and was right away denied by pro-Gadaffi media wing, and was finally confirmed to be misinformation when on 9 June a captured pro-Gadaffi loyalist soldier in Misrata told the rebel forces that he personally saw that Khamis Gadaffi was alive and well, leading his soldiers in Zliten.\n\nParagraph 4: Where'd You Go? is an EP by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones released in 1991 by Taang! Records. It features the title track, \"Where'd You Go?\" which also appeared on their 1992 LP, More Noise and Other Disturbances. The video for the song was shot in Boston and received minor MTV airplay. The EP also features cover versions of Aerosmith's \"Sweet Emotion\", Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\", and Van Halen's  \"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\", the last of which was ranked the 27th best punk cover song  by Paste in 2017. The EP also has an updated version of \"Do Something Crazy\", which previously appeared on The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' debut album, Devil's Night Out. In 2008 a rerecorded version of Where'd You Go? recorded by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones was released as a playable song for the game Rock Band 2.\n\nParagraph 5: Darwin had no success with conventional treatments. In 1849, after about four months of incessant vomiting he took up the recommendation of his friend Captain Sulivan and cousin Fox to try the water therapy regimen at Dr James Gully's Water Cure Establishment at Malvern. He read Gully's book, which provided case histories and had a price list at the back. Darwin rented a villa at Malvern for his family and started a two-month trial of the treatment on 10 March. Gully agreed with Darwin's self-diagnosis of nervous dyspepsia and set him a routine including being heated by a spirit lamp until dripping with perspiration, then vigorous rubbing with cold wet towels and cold foot baths, a strict diet, and walks. Darwin enjoyed the attention and the demanding regime which left him no time to feel guilty about not working. His health improved rapidly, and he felt that the water cure was \"no quackery\". He had no faith in the homeopathic medicines Gully gave him three times a day but took them obediently. They stayed on until 30 June, and back home at Down House, he continued with the diet and with the water treatment aided by his butler. He followed the rules about rising early and rationing his working time and had the Sandwalk constructed in the grounds for his walking exercise, setting a routine which he continued.\n\nParagraph 6: Alternative versions of two episodes exist and have been commercially released. An early edit of \"Arrival\", with a different music score and additional dialogue and scenes not in the broadcast version, was located in the 2000s and released to DVD in 2002 as a standalone disc, and then on Network's 2007 40th anniversary DVD and BluRay sets in the UK and in 2009 in the A&E Home Video DVD and Blu-ray box sets. This alternative version was located on a near-pristine 35mm print and has been transferred in high-definition along with the 17 episodes for the Blu-ray release. An early edit of \"The Chimes of Big Ben\", again with an unbroadcast music score and additional scenes and dialogue not in the broadcast version, was located in the 1980s and initially released on VHS videotape by MPI Home Video. It was later included as a bonus feature on both the 2007 Network set and the A&E Home Video DVD release of the series in the early 2000s. In 2009 it was also included in the expanded A&E Home Video box set, but owing to the low quality of the print it was not upgraded to high definition as was \"Arrival\", and was instead included as a bonus on the set's standard DVD extras disc, which was included in both the DVD and Blu-ray editions.\n\nParagraph 7: \"Too Little Too Late\" was one of the first prospective songs from the album that Herbert played for JoJo. The singer claims she wanted to record the song as soon as she heard it for the first time, elaborating, \"When my team heard that song, they knew I could hit the sweet spot, musically and in terms of subject matter.\" According to Vibe, the overall more mature, personal sentiment of the album prompted her to record \"Too Little Too Late\", having experienced both her first love and first heartbreak since the release of her self-titled debut album. The song was recorded at both Cryptic Studios in Los Angeles, California and Sony Music Studios in New York, New York. The songwriters got along both with JoJo and her mother Diana Levesque, who is also her manager, so well that they later returned to the studio to co-write a second song for the album with JoJo herself, entitled \"How to Touch a Girl\". In regards his musical style, JoJo described Steinberg as \"more of a classic writer and producer.\" Having previously written several successful singles throughout the 1980s and 1990s for artists such as Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, The Bangles, Whitney Houston and Heart, Steinberg, aged 56 at the time, realized he is older than JoJo (15) and Alexander (24) combined while working in the recording studio with the two younger artists but didn't find it difficult to write lyrics appropriate for them, explaining, \"I think that the part of me that writes lyrics isn\u2019t really old or young ... I think the lyrics flow out in a way that has an honesty to it.\" On the difference between writing for younger versus older artists, Steinberg explained \"you don't really know it's for somebody younger ... I've almost never really sat down and said, 'I'm going to try to write one that would be good for somebody younger.' I just write a song, and then if somebody younger likes it, then they sing it.\"\n\nParagraph 8: For the invocation of a procedure (or function) with parameters, their type will be known (they being declared before use) but their usage in the procedure invocation may not be. Fortran for example passes all parameters by reference (i.e. by address) so there is no immediate difficulty with generating the code (as always, with actual addresses to be fixed up later), but Pascal and other languages allow parameters to be passed by different methods at the programmer's choice (by reference, or by value, or even perhaps by \"name\") and this is signified only in the definition of the procedure, which is unknown before the definition has been encountered. Specifically for Pascal, in the specification of parameters a prefix \"Var\" signifies that it must be received by reference, its absence signifies by value. In the first case the compiler must generate code that passes the address of the parameter, while in the second it must generate different code that passes a copy of the value, usually via a stack. As always, a \"fixup\" mechanism could be invoked to deal with this, but it would be very messy. Multi-pass compilers can of course collate all the required information as they shuttle back and forth, but single-pass compilers cannot. Code generation could be paused while the scan advances (and its results be held in internal storage) until such time as the needed entity is encountered, and this might not be regarded as resulting in a second pass through the source because the code generation stage will soon catch up, it was merely halting for a while. But this would be complex. Instead a special construction is introduced, whereby the procedure's definition of parameter usage is declared \"forward\" of its later full definition so that the compiler may know it before use, as it requires.\n\nParagraph 9: Williams came into the Australian Open unseeded, because of her world no. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as \"out of shape\". Williams in her opening match faced 27th seed Mara Santangelo and lost only three games, with the help of ten aces. In her next match she faced qualifier Anne Kremer, which she had to break back when she was broken in the fifth game to push it to a tie-break. Kramer took four of the first five points, before Williams could win the last six to take the breaker. Williams then took the first four games of the second and eventually closed it out in the eight game. In the round of 32, Williams had 5th seed Nadia Petrova on the other side of the net. Petrova dominated the first set losing only a game and served for the match in the tenth game of the second. However, Williams broke back and won the next two games to take the second set when Petrova double faulted. Williams then took the deciding set with a single break lead, serving it out in the ninth game. This was her first win over a top-10 player since defeating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 Australian Open final. In the fourth round, she faced 11th ranked Jelena Jankovi\u0107 and cruised in straight sets with a drop of only five games. Williams fired eight aces to go with 31 winners and 28 errors. This is her first time since the 2005 Australian Open to get past the fourth round of a slam. In the last eight, she took on Shahar Pe'er. Pe'er broke in the first game and held the led through closing it out in the ninth game. Williams then took the last four games of the second set form the fifth game to take it to a decider. Williams broke in the fourth game, just for Pe'er to break back and get back on serve latter in the set. Pe'er then broke in the eleventh game and served for the match; Williams then broke back and won the next two games to go through. Williams had 49 unforced errors and only 30 winners. In the final 4, Williams faced 17-year-old Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1. The first went to a tie-break in which Williams took the first four points then Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1 rallied to tie it at 5, Williams then took the next two points to take the set. Williams then broke Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1 twice and served for the match at the eight game, Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1 came back and broke and saved four match points on her own serve to hold. Williams then served it out in the tenth game. Tracy Austin in her tournament analysis stated that Williams had a great tournament but the ride was over and that Maria Sharapova would have no trouble with Williams. Serena thought it was mean and unnecessary and used it as motivation. In the first set, Williams took the first five games before Sharapova could get a game, Williams then held to close out the set. Williams then made four games in a row in the second before Sharapova could win a game, Williams served it out in the eight game and won the match. This is her first title at any tournament since winning the 2005 Australian Open. Williams finished with 28 winners and 11 unforced errors. Williams came the first player since Chris O'Neil to win the title whilst not being seeded; and claimed her third Australian Open and eighth Grand Slam singles title overall. The win elevated Williams to 14th in the rankings. Williams dedicated the title to her deceased sister Yetunde Price.  Her performance in the final was described in the press as \"one of the best performances of her career\" and \"arguably the most powerful display ever seen in women's tennis.\"\n\nParagraph 10: Similar to the atrium, the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the left ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body. With respect to thermoregulation, the American flamingo has highly vascularized feet that use a countercurrent exchange system in their legs and feet. This method of thermoregulation keeps a constant gradient between the veins and arteries that are in close proximity in order to maintain heat within the core and minimize heat loss or gain in the extremities. Heat loss is minimized while wading in cold water, while heat gain is minimized in the hot temperatures during rest and flight.\n\nParagraph 11: Another mimic variant appears in the Forgotten Realms setting boxed set, The Ruins of Undermountain II: The Deep Levels (1994), in the set's 16-page Monstrous Compendium booklet. Stated to be found only in the setting's Undermountain thus far, the greater mimic is vastly larger than a common mimic and can cover a whole room or a small building such as a tomb; the largest known specimen can cover a  cubic area. A greater mimic has a higher intelligence than a common mimic, and a limited resistance to magic, and \"can alter its coloring and shape to imitate a vast number of textures, colors, and shapes at once... [creating] entire rooms of furniture, treasure and tapestries.\" A greater mimic can block a corridor and alter its shape to become a room with entrance doors on either side, so that its prey walks directly into it; a greater mimic will always use enticements such as simulated treasure or furniture to lure prey, and will wait until an entire group enters before attacking. A greater mimic will then release its natural adhesive across all its surfaces and attack by slamming the walls of its structure together. A minority of greater mimics can develop an ability to display illusory creatures inside itself, pretending to speak through these creatures' mouths. This mutation of the common mimic, according to its entry in this boxed set, is presumed to be the result of either a mimic having lived for a century and grown to great size, or perhaps a mimic altered by the strange magic of Undermountain and the wizards that reside there. A greater mimic is unlikely to obey a wizard, although Halaster is able to use these creatures as guards and barriers against adventurers. A greater mimic has limited mobility to due its size, and will usually settle in one place. A greater mimic makes pacts with other local creatures for food, but can sustain itself on little or no food for long periods of time if need be; a greater mimic has a prodigious appetite, however, and does not practice conservation if a steady supply of food is available. A greater mimic appears in this boxed set's Campaign Guide booklet, as part of the \"Muiral's Gauntlet\" scenario, living in an abandoned drow complex. When encountered by player characters, this greater mimic covers most of the floor in an apparent storeroom filled with boxes of coins and valuables; if it appears to be losing a fight against the characters, it will negotiate, trading information for its life. The greater mimic's entry is reprinted in the Monstrous Compendium Annual Two (1995), although no mention is made there of Undermountain.\n\nParagraph 12: The work of Catholic nun and missionary Anjez\u00eb Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, commonly known as Mother Teresa and from 2016 as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, received mixed reactions from prominent people, governments, and organisations. Her practices, and those of the Missionaries of Charity, the order which she founded, were subject to numerous controversies. These include objections to the quality of medical care which they provided, suggestions that some deathbed baptisms constituted forced conversion, and alleged links to colonialism and racism and to relations to questionable public figures. The controversy extends to include the large sums of money donated to her as well as the Vatican for ignoring the criticisms raised.\n\nParagraph 13: Most fields of studies have a founding father, such as Newton in physics and Lavoisier in chemistry. Materials science on the other hand has no central figure that set in motion materials studies. In the 1940s, wartime collaborations of multiple fields of study to produce technological advances became a structure to the future field of study that would become known as material science and engineering. During the Cold War in the 1950s, US President Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) made materials a priority, when it realized that materials were the limiting factor for advances in space and military technology. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), referred to as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) since 1996. In 1960, ARPA encouraged the establishment of interdisciplinary laboratories (IDL's) on university campuses, which would be dedicated to the research of materials, as well as to the education of students on how to conduct materials science research.  ARPA offered 4 year IDL contracts to universities, originally to Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, and Northwestern University, eventually granting nine more contracts. Although ARPA is no longer in control of the IDL program (the National Science Foundation took over the program in 1972 ), the original establishment of IDL's marked a significant milestone in the United States' research and development of materials science. Several institutions departments changed titles from \"metallurgy\" to \"metallurgy and materials science\" in the 1960s.\n\nParagraph 14: DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix is the 6th game in the Dance Dance Revolution series of music video games. It was released in the arcades by Konami on October 19, 2001, and for the PlayStation 2 on May 16, 2002, in Japan. 6thMix contains a total of 42 songs, all which made their first arcade appearance on this release. 11 of these songs debuted in various console releases prior to 6thMix. All arcade songs from Dance Dance Revolution to Dance Dance Revolution 5thMix were removed in 6thMix, although many of the Konami originals from those games would later be revived in future arcade releases.\n\nParagraph 15: In 1824, British Governor Sir Charles MacCarthy, was defeated by the Ashanti army, committed suicide, and his skull was taken back to the Ashanti capital Kumasi where it was reportedly used as a drinking cup. George Maclean was President of the Committee of Merchants at Cape Coast Castle from 1830 until 1844, a period when a President rather than a Governor ruled the British in the Gold Coast. In October 1836 he met the poet Letitia Landon at a dinner party while on a visit to the UK. They married and traveled back to Cape Coast Castle where, within two months, Landon died of heart failure. Both Maclean and Landon are buried in the castle courtyard. Maclean was charged with putting an end to slave trading and did so along  of the West African coast. However his reputation was muddied by his willingness to support the ownership of slaves within the vicinity of Cape Coast Castle. As such he was demoted to Judicial Assessor and maintained for his extensive local knowledge and commitment to trade. He also made peace with the Ashanti (Treaty of 1831), instituted a judicial system still in use in many African democracies, and encouraged successful and fair trading.  From 1846\u20131850, Governor William Winniett was also active in ending the slave trade. He died in the Fortress.\n\nParagraph 16: Owing to its location on the immediate leeward side of the Andes, Esquel has a cool summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csb) bordering on a Humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dsb).  Other climate systems, such as the Trewartha climate classification, place it within the oceanic zone (Do), like much of Western Europe and the Pacific Northwest. Temperatures are relatively cold for its climate due to its higher altitude. Summers are mild with warm temperatures during the afternoon followed by cool nights. The mean temperature during the summer is around . It's the sunniest season, averaging as much as 10 hours of sunshine per day in January with an average of 7\u20138 clear days and only 5-7 overcast days. Spring and fall are transition seasons featuring mild temperatures during the day and cool to cold nights. Spring starts out with cool temperatures during the day and very cold nights which progressively becomes warmer. Both spring and fall have highly variable weather. \n\nParagraph 17: The wave theory of social development holds that intense periods of social activity are followed by periods of remission, in which the activists involved intensely in mobilization are systematically marginalized and isolated. After the intense period fighting for women's suffrage, the common interest which had united international feminists left the women's movement without a single focus upon which all could agree. Ideological differences between radicals and moderates, led to a split and a period of deradicalization, with the largest group of women's activists spearheading movements to educate women on their new responsibilities as voters. Organizations like the African National Congress Women's League, the Irish Housewives Association, the League of Women Voters, the Townswomen's Guilds and the Women's Institutes supported women and tried to educate them on how to use their new rights to incorporate themselves into the established political system. Still other organizations, involved in the mass movement of women into the workforce during World War I and World War II and their subsequent exit at the end of the war with concerted official efforts to return to family life, turned their efforts to labor issues. The World YWCA and Zonta International, were leaders in these efforts, mobilizing women to gather information on the situation of working women and organize assistance programs. Increasingly, radical organizations, like the American National Women's Party, were marginalized by media which denounced feminism and its proponents as \"severe neurotics responsible for the problems of\" society. Those who were still attached to the radical themes of equality were typically unmarried, employed, socially and economically advantaged and seemed to the larger society to be deviant.\n\nParagraph 18: Male, female.

Hindwing shining brownish grey, cilia ochreous-brown. Underside: forewing shining brownish grey, white apical line visible in the cilia, hindwing shining pale grey. Abdomen dorsally shining yellowish brown with reddish gloss, segment six banded whitish posteriorly, ventrally shining white, anal tuft ochreous.\n\nParagraph 19: The origin of their literature dates to 1563, when the first Konkani grammar was published by Fr Andre Vaz at St Paulo College at Old Goa. In 1567 the first Konkani-Portuguese dictionary was published by missionary priests at Rachol, Goa. In 1622 Thomas Stephens, an English Jesuit, published  Doutrina Christam em Lingoa Bramana Canarim (Christian Doctrines in the Canarese Brahmin Language), which was the first book in Konkani and any Indian language. On 22 December 1821 the first periodical, Gazeta de Goa (Goa Gazetteer), edited by Antonio Jose de Lima Leitao, was published. On 22 January 1900 the first Portuguese newspaper, O Heraldo, was started by Prof. Messias Gomes. It was transformed into an English daily in 1987. Periodicals such as Amcho Ganv (1930) by Luis de Menezes, Vauraddeancho Ixxt (1933), a weekly by Fr. Arcencio Fernandes and Fr. Gracianco Moraes, Aitarachem Vachop, a Konkani weekly run by the Salesians, and Gulab by Fr. Freddy J. da Costa were published in Goa. Konkani-Portuguese periodicals such as O Concani, a weekly by Sebasti\u0101o Jesus Dias, Sanjechem Noketr (The Evening Star) (1907) by B.F. Cabral, O Goano (1907) by Honarato Furtado and Francis Futardo, and Ave Maria (1919) edited by Antonio D'Cruz were published in Bombay. In February 1899 Udentenchem Sallok (Lotus of the East) by Eduardo J. Bruno de Souza, the first Konkani periodical, was published as a fortnightly in Poona. The first Konkani book in the Devanagri script, Kristanv Doton ani Katisism by Dr. George Octaviano Pires, was published in Sholapore in 1894. Fr. Ludovico Pereria's monthly Dor Mhoineachi Rotti (Monthly Bread) was published in Karachi in 1915. In 1911 the first Konkani novel, Kristanv Ghorabo (Christian Home), was published. Modern literature is diverse and includes themes such as historical awakening in Lambert Mascarenhas' Sorrowing Lies My Land, feminism in Maria Aurora Couto's Goa: A Daughters' Story, and fantasy in Nandita da Cunha's The Magic of Maya. In 1974, the Archdiocese of Goa and Daman published the Novo Korar (New Testament) of the Holy Bible in Konkani. Later, on 4 June 2006, the Archdiocese released the complete Catholic Bible in Konkani employing the Latin alphabet known as Povitr Pustok. In 2018, Archbishop of Goa and Daman Filipe Neri Ferrao launched the Povitr Pustok, a Konkani Bible app, a mobile phone application software with the entire Konkani Bible text.\n\nParagraph 20: The fineness of a precious metal object (coin, bar, jewelry, etc.) represents the weight of fine metal therein, in proportion to the total weight which includes alloying base metals and any impurities. Alloy metals are added to increase hardness and durability of coins and jewelry, alter colors, decrease the cost per weight, or avoid the cost of high-purity refinement. For example, copper is added to the precious metal silver to make a more durable alloy for use in coins, housewares and jewelry. Coin silver, which was used for making silver coins in the past, contains 90% silver and 10% copper, by mass. Sterling silver contains 92.5% silver and 7.5% of other metals, usually copper, by mass.\n\nParagraph 21: It has a snout rather acuminate, as long as the distance between the eye and the upper border of the ear-opening, 1.3 the diameter of the orbit; forehead concave; interorbital space very narrow; upper eyelid strongly fringed; ear-opening large, obliquely crescentic, the concavity being directed forwards and upwards, its diameter equalling three fourths that of the eye. Body and limbs moderate. Digits free, moderately dilated, inner well developed; infradigital lamellae obliquely curved; 10 lamellae under the thumb, 10 under the third finger, 9 under the inner toe, and 12 under the third toe. Snout covered with large convex granular scales, largest between the eye and the nostril; hinder part of head with minute granules, and scattered ones of a larger size. Rostral four times as broad as deep (having fused with the anterior labial on each side); nostril above the rostral, between the latter and three nasals; 10 or 11 upper and 9 lower labials; mental large, triangular, twice as long as the adjacent labial, its point between two large chin-shields which are in contact behind it; a small chin-shield on each side of the large pair. Upper surface of body covered -with small irregular flat grannies and moderately large, trihedral, strongly keeled tubercles arranged in 14 or 16 rather irregular longitudinal series; the largest tubercles measure about one fourth the diameter of the eye. Abdominal scales small, smooth, rounded, imbricate. Male with a shore angular series of 8 preanal pores. Tail cylindrical, tapering, covered above with small, irregular, imbricate smooth scales and scattered pointed tubercles forming four or six longitudinal series, beneath with a series of transversely dilated plates. Pale yellowish brown, with six faint brownish transverse narrow dorsal bands, the tubercles in these areas being almost black; a dark brown streak from the nostrils through the eye above the ear, with a whitish line above it; lips whitish.\n\nParagraph 22: The Bangladesh Navy was created as part of Bangladesh Forces during Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan. Its official creation date is July 1971 during the Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971. In 1971, with West Pakistan imposing a brutal military crackdown in East Pakistan, the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, PADMA and PALASH, and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small patrol vessels, was inaugurated. These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the Indian Air Force on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on Mongla seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.\n\nParagraph 23: In February, 1964, Wilkinson announced that he would enter a special election to replace his friend, the late Robert S. Kerr, as U. S. Senator from Oklahoma. He had already resigned his position as head coach of the Oklahoma University Sooners.   Politicians and the Oklahoma press debated whether he was qualified to become a U. S. Senator, though all seemed to agree that his popularity as a cultural icon gave him an important edge. Easily winning the Republican primary, Wilkinson became the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1964, at which point he legally changed his first name to Bud, but narrowly lost to Democrat Fred R. Harris, then a State Senator in Oklahoma. Both parties involved political heavyweights from out of state to campaign for their candidates. Republicans invited former President Eisenhower and Senator Barry Goldwater. Illness made Eisenhower miss the occasion, so his former Vice President Richard Nixon served as substitute. Harris supporters got President Lyndon Johnson to make an appearance, as well as several other national Democrats. Wilkinson's Republican advisers brought in Senator Strom Thurmond to appeal to ultra-conservative voters in Little Dixie, which had recently turned reliably Republican. That effort backfired. Harris later said, \"my campaign got an extra benefit from Senator Thurmond's Oklahoma visit \u2026 Thurmond wound up scaring the daylights out of even a lot of conservative white voters with his jingoist speeches, advocating for the escalation of the American war effort in Vietnam.\" In the 1964 General Election, Republican presidential nominee, Senator Barry Goldwater lost to incumbent President Lyndon Baines Johnson 55-45 percent in Oklahoma. Through 2020, Johnson is the last Democrat to carry Oklahoma in a presidential election. Wilkinson entertained seeking the other Oklahoma U.S. Senate seat in 1968, but he did not run, and the position went to former Governor Henry Bellmon, also a Republican.\n\nParagraph 24: Livy's account of the struggles of Gaius Licinius and Lucius Sextius and their legislation on the consulship has been analysed by T.J. Cornell. He thinks that very little of Livy's narrative can be accepted. However, its institutional changes are \"reasonably certain.\" He argues that the significance of the law on the consulship is unclear and its background is \"extremely puzzling\" due to obscurity around the military tribunes with consular power. Livy wrote that they had been instituted because it was decided that in some years the consulship should be replaced by the consular tribunes (whose numbers varied from three to six), that this office would be open to plebeians and that it had been created as a concession to the plebeians who wanted access to the consulship. However, from 444 BC (the year of the first consular tribunes) to 401 BC there were only two plebeian consular tribunes (out of a total of 100).  For the 400-376 BC period, in 400, 399 and 396 BC the majority of these tribunes were plebeians (4, 5, and 5 out of 6, respectively) and in 379 BC there were three plebeians of six. This raises some questions. Why from 444 to 401 BC were there only two plebeians? Why, given the presence of plebeians in the subsequent period, which shows their eligibility to the highest office, was plebeian access to the consulship considered such a landmark for the political promotion of the plebeians? Why was there such resistance to this? The sources seem to see the law as a breakthrough not just because it provided access to the consulship, but because it required that one of the two consuls each year be a patrician. However, during one twelve-year period after the passage of the laws, from 355 to 343 BC, both consuls were patricians and the consulship became an unbroken line of shared office only after that.\n\nParagraph 25: Mickey Smith is first introduced in the series' 2005 reboot premi\u00e8re episode, \"Rose\". When Mickey's girlfriend Rose (Billie Piper) begins investigating a mysterious alien called the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), Mickey is captured by the alien Nestene Consciousness, from which a living plastic facsimile of him (an 'auton') is created. Mickey, terrified by the revelation that alien life exists, fails to impress the Doctor, who only invites Rose to be his travelling companion in time and space. In the year since Rose absconded with the Doctor, Mickey has been the prime suspect for Rose's disappearance and has become distressed as a result. However, he assists the pair in defeating the Slitheen, a family of extraterrestrial criminals; using his computer hacking skills, he commandeers a military harpoon missile which he targets at 10 Downing Street to kill the Slitheen. Mickey then declines an invitation from the Doctor to join him and Rose in the TARDIS. A much younger Mickey, played by Casey Dyer, appears briefly when Rose attempts to alter her childhood in \"Father's Day\". In \"Boom Town\", Mickey later meets up with the Doctor, Rose and new companion Captain Jack (John Barrowman) in Cardiff, where he helps them foil a Slitheen plot. In the series' finale episode \"The Parting of the Ways\", when Rose becomes stranded at home at the Powell Estate, Mickey uses a recovery truck to crack open the TARDIS's console, through which Rose is able to absorb the time vortex and save the universe from an invasion of the hateful mutant alien Daleks.\n\nParagraph 26: The establishment of the Portuguese on the Western coast of India was of particular interest to the New Christians population of Portugal who were suffering harshly under the Portuguese Inquisition. The crypto-Jewish targets of the Inquisition in Portugal began flocking to Goa, and their community reached considerable proportions. India was attractive for Jews who had been forcibly baptized in Portugal for a variety of reasons. One reason was that India was home to ancient, well-established Jewish communities. Jews who had been forcibly converted could approach these communities, and re-join their former faith if they chose to do so, without having to fear for their lives as these areas were beyond the scope of the Inquisition. Another reason was the opportunity to engage in trade (spices, diamonds, etc) from which New Christians in Portugal had been restricted at the onset of the Portuguese Inquisition. In his book, The Marrano Factory, Professor Antonio Saraiva of the University of Lisbon details the strength of the New Christians on the economic front by quoting a 1613 document written by attorney, Martin de Zellorigo. Zellorigo writes regarding \"the Men of the Nation\" (a term used for Jewish New Christians): \"For in all of Portugal there is not a single merchant (hombre de negocios) who is not of this Nation. These people have their correspondents in all lands and domains of the king our lord. Those of Lisbon send kinsmen to the East Indies to establish trading-posts where they receive the exports from Portugal, which they barter for merchandise in demand back home. They have outposts in the Indian port cities of Goa and Cochin and in the interior. In Lisbon and in India nobody can handle the trade in merchandise except persons of this Nation. Without them, His Majesty will no longer be able to make a go of his Indian possessions, and will lose the 600,000 ducats a year in duties which finance the whole enterprise \u2013 from equipping the ships to paying the seamen and soldiers\" The Portuguese reaction to the New Christians in India came in the form of bitter letters of complaint and polemics that were written, and sent to Portugal by secular and ecclesiastical authorities; these complaints were about trade practices, and the abandonment of Catholicism. In particular, the first archbishop of Goa Dom Gaspar de Leao Pereira, was extremely critical of the New Christian presence, and was highly influential in petitioning for the establishment of the Inquisition in Goa.\n\nParagraph 27: The songwriting process for California was much less collaborative than the band's previous albums. Despite having a more accessible sound than prior releases, saxophonist Clinton McKinnon has stated, \"It wasn\u2019t some attempt at reconciling how much we\u2019d previously tortured our audiences with white-noise [...] it wasn\u2019t some conscious attempt to normalise our music or make it all the more palatable.\" On the album's writing and sound, Trevor Dunn stated in a 2017 interview that, \"[we] never discussed our projected direction. We never sat down and said, 'ok the last record was like that so now let\u2019s attempt this.' Instead we individually brought things to the collective table that somehow coalesced without premeditation.\" He goes on to state that \"the recording of California was a bit of a nightmare. We attempted frugality by recording a lot in our rehearsal space which [our guitarist] Trey [Spruance] had partially turned into a recording studio.  But we also spread the work out over various outside studios with a number of engineers as well as additional musicians.  In the end we had two 24-track tape machines and two ADAT machines linked. That record would have been much easier to manage had Pro Tools come along a bit sooner.\"\n\nParagraph 28: The monster depicted in the mural was first referred to as the \"Piasa Bird\" in an article published c. 1836 by John Russell of Bluffdale, Illinois. John Russell was a professor of Greek and Latin at Shurtleff College, Upper Alton, Illinois. The article was entitled \"The Tradition of The Piasa\" and Russell claimed the origin of the word to be from a nearby stream: \"This stream is the Piasa. Its name is Indian, and signifies, in the Illini, \"The Bird That Devours Men.\" The original Piasa Creek ran through the main ravine in downtown Alton, and was completely covered by huge drainage pipes around 1912. According to the story published by Russell, the creature depicted by the painting was a huge bird that lived in the cliffs. Russell claimed that this creature attacked and devoured people in nearby Indian villages shortly after the corpses of a war gave it a taste for human flesh. The legend claims that a local Indian chief, named Chief Ouatoga, managed to slay the monster using a plan given to him in a dream from the Great Spirit. The chief ordered his bravest warriors to hide near the entrance of the Piasa Bird's cave, which Russell also claimed to have explored. Ouatoga then acted as bait to lure the creature out into the open. As the monster flew down toward the Indian chief, his warriors slew it with a volley of poisoned arrows. Russell claimed that the mural was painted by the Indians as a commemoration of this heroic event.\n\nParagraph 29: After the invasion of Poland, the prison became part of the German District of Warsaw, in the borough, reserved for the German administration of the General Government and the German occupation army. The prison was one of several prisons of the Gestapo in Warsaw. It housed Polish politicians, freedom fighters, resistance workers and ordinary people caught in \u0142apankas on the streets of Warsaw. The site became infamous due to constant torture of the inmates. It was known as one of the places of no return (Nacht und Nebel), from which the only way out was to the execution site, or to a German concentration camp. It was also a place of detention of innocent hostages, taken by Germans as punishment for actions by the Home Army. Later they were killed in mass executions announced publicly.\n\nParagraph 30: | colspan=\"5\" |Koiwai announces the time has come to set out the kotatsu, and Yotsuba helps pick up loose items around the room. Yanda convinces Koiwai to purchase a blender, and teaches Yotsuba a simple recipe for banana smoothies. He frightens her by yelling the blender will explode, but after tasting the smoothie, Yotsuba forgives him. On their way to the seashore to collect rocks, Yotsuba and Koiwai run into Ena and Miura; the two older girls are excited to join the rock-collecting expedition. The first spot they pick turns out to be a sandy beach with few rocks, but a strange man directs them to a better location where they collect many smooth and interesting rocks. At the Ayase household, while comparing rocks with Ena, Yotsuba is lured away by the snacks Fuuka brought to her cram session with Miss Stake. Fuuka prepares a short test for Yotsuba as a break from her studies, and Miss Stake demonstrates origami for Yotsuba as well; at 4:30\u00a0pm, Yotsuba returns to her home, and the teens resume their studies, only to discover that Yotsuba has eaten all the snacks. After Yotsuba watches Ena paint a birthday card for a friend, she begs her father for a paint set, and they go to an art supply store with Jumbo. Jumbo selects a set for her and Yotsuba paints an ocean for the mermaid princess. When Yanda arrives, Jumbo and Koiwai pretend to have died as a joke. Later, Yanda sees Yotsuba's painting of the ocean and asks if he could sell it and quit his job. Yotsuba gets a haircut; the stylist offers a picture book as a distraction, but Yotsuba insists on a glossy magazine featuring sushi instead. They buy bread from a new bakery on the way home, but Yotsuba is disappointed by the lack of cream filling. Yotsuba illustrates her own picture book entitled Sunday featuring herself as the Sparkle Princess, who defeats a monster that destroyed the world, then goes to school with a backpack. In a good mood because her exams are finished, Fuuka is humming but is criticized by her sisters and mother as atonal; she is sent by her mother to the Koiwai house with apples. There, she is greeted by Yotsuba and directed to sit down for a haircut, which she selects from a book illustrated by Yotsuba that pairs foods and hair styles. Shocked that Koiwai has not purchased a backpack for Yotsuba, Fuuka coaches him to call his mother, who immediately offers to pay for it. At the store, Yotsuba chooses a red backpack and as she models it for Fuuka, Koiwai realizes that Yotsuba will start school in a few months and remembers a story he told when he went camping with Jumbo and Yanda: he didn't feel like a father until Yotsuba began talking and calling him \"Daddy\". He is overcome with emotion and Yotsuba vows to protect him, mistaking his tears for physical pain.", "answers": ["Paragraph 8"], "pred": "2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,", "length": 8679, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5096757b48e895ad15b31e620bedd26e5ba11406619bb23f"}
{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: When interviewed by Make-A-Wish, Ben's wish was to design a video game in which cancer cells were eaten to help other children visualize fighting their cancer and help them to cope with cancer treatments. He remembered his oncologist telling him to think of chemotherapy as eating cancer cells. When Make-A-Wish first approached gaming companies - their requests to help create a cancer-fighting video game were denied. Make-a-Wish Executive Director Patricia Wilson was told that a video game would take upwards of US$1,000,000 and possibly years to create. Ms. Wilson sought the help of her Board of Directors and within days the request to fulfill Ben's wish was posted on several gaming sites. Inquiries and offers to assist began immediately from game designers in the UK, Israel, Canada and the United States. One particular offer came from a Bay Area game designer who offered to spearhead the entire game design on one condition: that he have a chance to meet and work with Ben directly. Eric Johnston, a software engineer from LucasArts met with Ben weekly for 6 months and together, they created Ben's Game. Ben's own pediatric oncologist served as medical adviser for the game upon condition that UCSF Children's Hospital be the first medical facility to have the game installed for children to play.\n\nParagraph 2: Predecessor units trace their origins to 1795, and since 1949 Royal Newfoundland Regiment has been a unit of the Canadian Army. During the First World War the battalion-sized Newfoundland Regiment was the only North American unit to fight in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915. Later in the war the regiment was virtually wiped out at Beaumont Hamel on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, but was rebuilt and continued to serve throughout France and Belgium until the armistice, serving as part of the British Army of the Rhine in 1919. In December 1917, George V bestowed the regiment with the right to use the prefix royal before its name. It was the only military unit to receive this honour during the First World War.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1910 Edwin was living in the Bronx, New York and working as a cotton goods salesman. Around 1911 he moved the family from the Bronx to Hollis, Queens. He registered for the draft on September 12, 1918, but did not serve in World War I. He became a Democratic party ward heeler for Tammany Hall, and was appointed as the Commissioner of Public Markets for New York City by mayor John F. Hylan.  He testified on August 18, 1922 before the Kings County, New York Grand Jury, which was investigating the mishandling of the fees paid by vendors to the Public Markets office. No charges were filed.\n\nParagraph 4: At a Christmas lecture, a nun named Sister Mary Ignatius explains to the audience the basic tenets of Catholicism. She is assisted by her favorite student, seven-year-old Thomas. From time to time, she asks him catechism questions and gives him a cookie for every right answer. Half-way into her speech, four of her former students, Gary Sullivan, Diane Symonds, Philomena Rostovich, and Aloysius Benheim, enter dressed as St. Joseph, The Virgin Mary, and two halves of a camel. The four remind Sister that she had asked them to come in and perform the pageant they once performed in her class. After the pageant, it becomes apparent that the four have strayed from her teaching; Diane has had two abortions (the first one from a rape at age 18), Philomena is an unwed mother, Aloysius is an alcoholic who beats his wife and is thinking about suicide, and Gary is gay. They reveal that they were never asked to come in and merely wanted to embarrass Sister. They each have their own reason for hating her; Aloysius was refused bathroom privileges frequently and now has bladder problems, Philomena recalls being hit by Sister for being a poor student, Gary is there on behalf of his boyfriend Jeff, and Diane had believed Sister until her world came crashing down when her mother died of breast cancer and she was raped the same day. Diane reveals that she has brought a gun to kill Sister, something the other three were not aware of. Sister grabs a gun from behind her lectern and shoots Diane in self-defense. She also shoots Gary, proclaiming that she has sent him to heaven, as he went to confession earlier that day. She then points the gun at Aloysius, who needs to go to the bathroom, before handing it to Thomas to take a nap. The play ends with Thomas pointing the gun at Aloysius while explaining the perfections of God, Diane and Gary's dead bodies on the floor, and Sister asleep.\n\nParagraph 5: The Falcon is the nickname for two fictional detectives. Drexel Drake (real name Charles H. Huff) created Michael Waring, alias the Falcon, a freelance investigator and troubleshooter, in his 1936 novel, The Falcon's Prey. It was followed by two more novels \u2013 The Falcon Cuts In, 1937, and The Falcon Meets a Lady, 1938 \u2013 and a 1938 short story. Michael Arlen created Gay Stanhope Falcon in 1940. This Falcon made his first appearance in Arlen's short story \"Gay Falcon\" (aka \"A Man Called Falcon\"), which was originally published in 1940 in Town & Country magazine. The story opens with the words \"Now of this man who called himself Gay Falcon many tales are told, and this is one of them.\" Arlen's Falcon is characterized as a freelance adventurer and troubleshooter \u2013 a man who makes his living \"keeping his mouth shut and engaging in dangerous enterprises.\"\n\nParagraph 6: The aspirational age can be identified as the age of which consumers associate positive experiences with, such as freedom. For example, most adults are preoccupied with day-to-day responsibilities which can be viewed as stressful. Marketing to the aspirational age therefore, allows businesses to attract a generation of nostalgic consumers. The aspirational age as a tool is thus essentially modelled on the notion of nostalgia. From the adult's perspective, the psychology behind the 'aspirational age' can be defined as a recapture of youthful days. 'High-speed modern living, stress and the impact of recession' have all been considered as factors which influence a consumer's longing of their 'aspirational age'.\n\nParagraph 7: The Assassin (2015)The Assassin (2015) was Hou's eighteenth feature film and garnered him the Best Director award at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where composer Giong Lim also won the Cannes Soundtrack Award. The film also swept the 2015 Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards, winning a grand total of five awards: Best Director, Best Feature Film, Best Cinematography (Ping Bin Lee), Best Makeup & Costume Design (Wen-Ying Huang), and Best Sound Effects (Duu-Chih Tu, Shih Yi Chu, Shu-yao Wu).> The film was also nominated for 5 additional Golden Horse awards: Best Leading Actress (Shi Qu), Best Adapted Screenplay (Cheng Ah, Chu T\u2019ien-wen and Hai-Meng Hsieh), Best Art Direction (Wen-Ying Huang), Best Original Film Score (Giong Lim) and Best Film Editing (Ching-Song Liao). The film was also nominated for a BAFTA Award for \"Best Foreign Language Film\", but lost to Wild Tales.The Assassin also won a Best Foreign Language Film award from the 2015 Florida Film Critics Circle Awards, a \"Best Film Not in the English Language\" award from the Online Film Critics Society (where it was also nominated for a Best Cinematography award for DP Ping Bin Lee), and a Best Foreign Language film award from the Vancouver Film Critics Circle in 2016. The film also won 2nd place for a Best Foreign Language Film award from the Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association in 2015, 3rd place in a 2015 indieWire Critics' Poll for Best Director and Best Cinematography (Ping Bin Lee), where it also received an 8th place for Best Film and a 9th place for Best Editing (Chih-Chia Huang), and 2nd place for a Best Foreign Language Film Award from the Southeastern Film Critics Association Awards in 2015.\n\nParagraph 8: During the Second World War, Constantine worked for the Ministry of Labour and National Service as a Welfare Officer responsible for West Indians employed in English factories. In 1943, the manager of a London hotel refused to accommodate Constantine and his family on the grounds of their race in an instance of the UK colour bar; Constantine successfully sued the hotel company. Commentators recognise the case as a milestone in British racial equality. Constantine qualified as a barrister in 1954, while also establishing himself as a journalist and broadcaster. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1954, entered politics and became a founding member of the People's National Movement, subsequently entering the government as minister of communications. From 1961 to 1964, he served as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and, controversially, became involved in issues relating to racial discrimination, including the Bristol Bus Boycott. In his final years, he served on the Race Relations Board, the Sports Council and the Board of Governors of the BBC. Failing health reduced his effectiveness in some of these roles, and he faced criticism for becoming a part of the British Establishment. He died of a heart attack on 1 July 1971, aged 69. In June 2021, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame as one of the special inductees to mark the inaugural edition of the ICC World Test Championship final.\n\nParagraph 9: Clea is the Sorceress Supreme of the Dark Dimension, possessing vast powers involving the manipulation of the forces of magic for a variety of effects. She has exhibited such abilities as transmutation, forming and throwing magical bolts of concussive energy, magically constructed animate beings, conjuring objects and energies, teleporting, telekinesis, levitation, mesmerism, thought-casting, controlling others' minds, casting illusions, and the tapping of extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. Presumably, she is capable of replicating any spell performed by her former mentor, Doctor Strange. As she is descended from the Faltine race of beings, it is suggested that she can generate her own mystical energy, like Umar and Dormammu, and draw upon it to fuel her magic. She also possesses greater strength and body density than that of a normal Earth human. Her age is indeterminate and the rate at which she ages is unknown since she has lived for centuries but has the form and demeanour of a twenty-year-old woman. Clea has defeated the Enchantress in single magical combat, and armed with the Flames of Regency, at the peak of her magical abilities, even rivalled her mother Umar in raw power.\n\nParagraph 10: Several rounds of intense severe thunderstorms brought significant damaging winds, very large hail, and several tornadoes primarily across the Southern United States from April\u00a09 into the evening of April\u00a011. April\u00a09 started with several clusters of multi-cells, supercells, and bowing segments across much of the Deep South. Strong straight-line thunderstorm winds in Shreveport, Louisiana toppled a tree onto a mobile home around 6:30\u00a0p.m. (23:30\u00a0UTC), resulting in a fatality. Several large hail-producing supercells then formed and moved through areas from Oklahoma to North Texas before merging into a large squall line and surging southeastward into Arkansas and Louisiana, producing widespread wind damage. Meanwhile, several tornado-producing supercells formed ahead of the line. A weak EF0\u00a0tornado was recorded by several storm spotters near Pelahatchie, Mississippi, causing intermittent tree damage. Just after midnight on April\u00a010, a large EF1\u00a0tornado ripped roofs off of sheds and carports and knocked down trees, including some that fell on homes, near Columbia, Mississippi. To the southwest, a low-end EF3\u00a0tornado tossed vehicles and damaged or destroyed several homes and mobile homes in the rural community of Waxia near Palmetto, Louisiana just after 2:00\u00a0a.m. CDT (07:00\u00a0UTC), resulting in one fatality and seven injuries. Later that morning, the squall line produced multiple tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle. A strong tornadic waterspout came onshore in Laguna Beach, Florida, causing severe EF2\u00a0damage to a business and damaging several homes. Another tornadic waterspout struck Gulf Lagoon Beach, located at the southeastern edge of the Panama City Beach city limits and caused EF0 damage to beach furniture. In Lynn Haven, an EF1\u00a0tornado caused considerable damage to an automotive business. That afternoon, isolated to widely scattered severe storms formed from the Great Lakes to the Carolinas, producing sporadic wind and hail damage as well as isolated tornadoes into the overnight hours. An EF1\u00a0tornado also caused damage to businesses and a radio tower, and flipped a car near Seneca, South Carolina. A brief EF0\u00a0tornado damaged a few homes near Cutlerville, Michigan, and another EF0\u00a0tornado damaged a home near Reidville, South Carolina. Early on April\u00a011, another EF1\u00a0tornado caused damage to homes and outbuildings near Belvoir, North Carolina. That afternoon, another squall line pushed southeastward down the entire Florida panhandle, producing mainly wind and hail damage, although a brief EF0\u00a0tornado that caused minor tree damage was confirmed near Eagle Lake. Another non-tornadic fatality occurred near Spring Hill when a person got out of their car after it was struck by a fallen tree and was electrocuted when they came in contact with downed power lines. Overall, the outbreak generated 20\u00a0tornadoes, resulting in one fatality. Two other non-tornadic deaths also occurred as a result of the severe weather. There was also at least $635 million in damage.\n\nParagraph 11: Heading into Slammiversary, Matt Morgan expressed his wishes to join the Mafia. This would lead to Angle facing Morgan in a singles match on TNA Impact! which Angle would win. After the match, Angle shook Morgan's hand, showing that he would want him in the MEM. On the following week's TNA Impact!, during a King of the Mountain qualification match between Angle and Sting, Morgan interfered and helped Angle win. After the match, Angle thanked Morgan for helping him win. Morgan would go on and ask Sting to let him become a member of the MEM. Sting agreed to a match at Slammiversary against Morgan where, if Morgan won, he could join the group. Sting went on to defeat Morgan at the pay-per-view. In the final match of the pay-per-view, Angle won the King of the Mountain match to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Samoa Joe turned heel and joined the MEM by handing him the World Heavyweight Championship belt, backstabbing the TNA Front Line in the process. On the June 25 edition of TNA Impact!, it was explained that Joe had been paid off by the MEM due to them being unable to defeat him. The MEM, as well as Morgan, attacked Sting in disapproval of his leadership, with Angle announcing that he had regained leadership of the group. The following week, Sting saved A.J. Styles from a beat down from his former stablemates, attacking each member of the MEM with his baseball bat and stealing Angle's TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt. The following week, Sting confronted Samoa Joe, claiming to unveil Joe's mystery adviser before Victory Road, where he would be facing Samoa Joe. Later on in the show, Sting disguised himself as Joe and nearly dragged out Joe's adviser from his car, before Joe stopped him, choking him out with the Coquina Clutch and his signature tribal knife. Joe then took back the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, returning it to Angle during the beatdown on Mick Foley at the end of the show. At Victory Road, the MEM gained full control of TNA's championship scene as Nash won the TNA Legends Championship from A.J. Styles to bring the title back to the MEM. At the same event, Booker and Steiner defeated Beer Money, Inc. for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, Angle defeated Foley to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and Taz was also revealed to be Joe's adviser; Taz would later state that he was just an associate of the MEM. On the July 30 episode of TNA Impact!, Kevin Nash lost the TNA Legends Championship to Mick Foley in a tag team match with Kurt Angle against Bobby Lashley and Mick Foley.\n\nParagraph 12: Before WCKT signed on, NBC programming had been carried on Fort Lauderdale's WFTL-TV (channel 23, later known as WGBS-TV after it had been acquired by Storer Broadcasting), which also held a secondary affiliation with the DuMont Television Network. However, WFTL struggled because television sets were not required to have UHF tuning capability (the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would later require such tuners to be included in sets manufactured from 1964 onward). It didn't help matters that much of the area, particularly Fort Lauderdale, got a fairly strong signal from WJNO-TV (channel 5, now WPTV) in West Palm Beach. When the Cox/Knight partnership won a construction permit and broadcast license to operate a station on VHF channel 7, NBC quickly agreed to move its affiliation to WCKT, since WCKR radio had been the longtime Miami affiliate of the NBC Blue Network (the forerunner to today's American Broadcasting Company (ABC)). Until WPST-TV (channel 10, now WPLG) signed on in August 1957, WCKT also shared ABC programming with WTVJ (channel 4), as part of an arrangement with the network to provide its programming throughout the market as television sets were not required to have UHF tuning capability at the time, preventing many in the area from receiving the market's original ABC affiliate, WITV (channel 17). Channel 23 became an independent station and eventually went dark, and later came back to the air in 1967 as WAJA-TV (it is now Univision flagship WLTV-DT).\n\nParagraph 13: The rebel princes generally came to a bad end: Zhuang Ji's former patron Liu Pi, ruler of Wu fled and was killed in flight by native Yue (a term used for various non-Han Chinese peoples), which people his duty had been to suppress, and his territory of Wu divided up among Liu Wu's sons. In contrast Zhuang Ji's patron Liu Wu was rewarded for his loyal support through the rebellion, his brother emperor Jingdi giving him honors and privileges. Liu Wu's private gardens rivaled the emperor's and he increased the number of his retinue, bringing in people whose actions would end up losing the favor he had gained with the emperor and leading to his eventual fall from grace. When Jingdi demoted his son Liu Rong from crown prince (taizi,  heir apparent), in 150 BCE, Liu Wu and Jingdi's mutual mother, empress dowager Dou took this opportunity to lobby for her son Jingdi to name her other son, Liu Wu, as crown prince and successor, rather than Jingdi promoting one of his sons to this position. Jingdi agreed initially, but was then talked out of it by advisors. For example, minister Yuan Ang warned strongly against this breaking of the laws of succession as a destabilizing precedent, appointing a brother rather than the usual practice of choosing a son. Proceeding in support of their patron, some of Liu Wu's new retainers then went out and murdered this minister, Yuan Ang, going on to commit a series of killings in the effort to regain their patron, Liu Wu's, position as crown prince and the opportunity to become emperor, if Jingdi were to suddenly die. When Jingdi found out about this intrigue, Liu Wu had his two retainers commit suicide, presenting their bodies to the emperor, in appeasement. Nevertheless, Liu Wu failed to regain favor after this, he was seldom received at court, and his half-nephew (the future emperor, Han Wudi) replaced him as crown prince. In another and related dangerous turn of events for Liu Wu, the new crown prince's mother Wang Zhi was promoted to first lady, consolidating power against him at court. However, Liu Wu did not loose support of all the powerful court females. His mother, empress dowager Dou, still supported him, refusing to eat until he was cleared of charges. After an official investigation, the report back to emperor Jingdi was that Liu Wu had been found to have been involved, that \"sparing the Prince of Liang would break the law of Han\", yet, \"killing him would deeply distress the Empress Dowager and upset the Emperor even more\", counseling Jingdi to drop the issue. In discussion with the women, he blamed the murders solely upon Liu Wu's two courtiers, now  dead and already lawfully punished. After returning from an unsuccessful trip to Chang'an, Liu Wu died at home in Liang, in 144\u2009BCE.\n\nParagraph 14: Murray was an outspoken activist at the forefront of the civil rights movement, alongside such leaders as Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. She coined the term Jane Crow, which demonstrated Murray's belief that Jim Crow laws also negatively affected African-American women. She was determined to work with other activists to put a halt to both racism and sexism. Murray's speech, \"Jim Crow and Jane Crow\", delivered in Washington, DC, in 1964, sheds light on the long struggle of African-American women for racial equality and their later fight for equality among the sexes. As she put it, \"Not only have they stood ... with Negro men in every phase of the battle, but they have also continued to stand when their men were destroyed by it.\" The black women decided to \"...continue ... [standing] ...\" for their freedom and liberty even when \"...their men ...\" began to experience exhaustion from a long struggle for civil rights. These women were unafraid to stand up for what they believed in and refused to back down from the long and tedious \"battle\".  Murray continued her praise for black women when she stated that \"...one cannot help asking: would the Negro struggle have come this far without the indomitable determination of its women?\" The \"Negro struggle\" was able to progress partly because of \"...the indomitable determination of its women.\"\n\nParagraph 15: Female. Forewing length 5.7\u00a0mm. Head: frons shining pale ochreous, vertex and neck tufts shining ochreous-brown, medially and laterally lined white, collar ochreous-brown; labial palpus first segment very short, white, second segment ochreous-grey with white longitudinal lines laterally and ventrally, remaining parts missing; scape dark brown, with white anterior and posterior lines, white ventrally, antenna shining dark brown, a white line from base to beyond one-half, followed towards apex by respectively a more or less annulated part of approximately 15 segments, four whitish, two dark brown, two white, nine dark brown and nine white segments at apex.

Abdomen not examined (already dissected).\n\nParagraph 16: With pressing construction needs in the Pacific, Naval Construction Battalion 5 was \"rushed\" in its formation.  With its ranks full of qualified tradesmen the battalion was quickly given its military indoctrination and processed in less than a month for transit to Port Hueneme, Ca.  From there the battalion boarded ship and was the first CB into the Hawaiian Territory.  \"NAS Honolulu\"  was actually Naval Air Station Barbers Point and it was on CB 5's work list.  Also on the list was Midway Atoll.  Sand Island had another airfield in need of attention.   Rounding out the first deployment were projects on French Frigate Shoals, Canton Island, Johnston Atoll and Palmyra atoll.  At French Frigate shoals an island had to be made for the base and airfield to be constructed upon. CB 5 was rotated CONUS on 19 March 1944, arriving Camp Parks, Ca on March 24. Five's Midway replacement was the 50th CB who arrived on April 4.   From Camp Parks the battalion was transferred to Port Hueneme.  While there the battalion was given its next assignment and attached to Cub-16.  That was canceled with the battalion attached to the 7th Fleet and General MacArthur.  On January 10, 1945 CB 5 departed Port Hueneme for Leyte where it arrived February 15.  Nine days later the battalion would land at it new job site on Calicoan, Samar.  The main projects would be an ABCD,  ACEPD,  NSD and roads and water supply for all of it.   At Calicoan CB 5 had divers doing shallow water work for a seaplane ramp.  There were several detachments, one to both Advance Base Unit 10(NABU-10) and NABU-12.  Able Company went to Balikpapan, Borneo to help the Aussies joining Detachments from the 111th and 113th CBs. On 13 August the battalion learned it was assigned Operation Olympic the first element of Operation Downfall.  Downfall was the plan for the invasion of Japan. Set to begin in November 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the Japanese island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b.  This was to be followed by Operation Coronet, the second element, which was planned to land near Tokyo. VJ-day terminated these Operations leaving NCB 5 in the Philippines.  CB 5 was then listed to be tasked to the Operation Beleaguer mission in China, but received notice mid-October that was canceled too.   Naval Construction Battalion 5 was deactivated on December 3, 1945.\n\nParagraph 17:  When consulted to broker peace during a later war, Sahl ibn Hunaif said, 'Blame yourselves! I remember how, on the day of Al-Hudaibiya, if we had been allowed to choose fighting, we would have fought (the pagans). At that time 'Umar came (to the Prophet) and said, \"Aren't we on the right (path) and they (pagans) in the wrong? Won't our killed persons go to Paradise, and theirs in the Fire?\" The Prophet replied, \"Yes.\" Umar further said, \"Then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before Allah has settled the matter between us?\" The Prophet said, \"O the son of Al-Khattab! No doubt, I am Allah's Apostle and Allah will never neglect me.\" So Umar left the place angrily and he was so impatient that he went to Abu Bakr and said, \"O Abu Bakr! Aren't we on the right (path) and they (pagans) on the wrong?\" Abu Bakr said, \"O the son of Al-Khattab! He is Allah's Apostle, and Allah will never neglect him.\" Then Sura Al-Fath (The Victory) was revealed.\"\n\nParagraph 18: In the January 2 Big Ten Conference opener against Minnesota, Michigan won its fifth consecutive game against Minnesota and its fifth consecutive game at the Williams Arena. After winning two games by a combined 50 points last year, Michigan beat Northwestern 74\u201351 to mark its sixth straight victory over the Wildcats. The team gave Nebraska its first loss in the new Pinnacle Bank Arena on January 9, its first five-game win streak since the 2013 NCAA tournament. By beating Penn State on January 14, Michigan won its first four conference games for the first time since the 2002\u201303 team won its first six games. In the game Stauskas had a game-high 21 points, a team-high five assists and six rebounds. On January 18 Michigan defeated (#3 AP, #3 Coaches) Wisconsin at the Kohl Center for the first time since the 1998\u201399 team won on February 27, 1999 against the 1998\u201399 Badgers, ending an 11-game losing streak at Wisconsin. It was the highest-ranked team to lose to Michigan on the road, surpassing a victory over #5 Duke on  December 5, 1964 by the Cazzie Russell-led 1964\u201365 team. After the win, Michigan returned to the national polls (#21, #T25). On January 21 Stauskas was the Big Ten Conference Player of the Week for the first time, leading the conference in scoring and 20-point games. On January 22 Michigan defeated (#10, #10) Iowa, matching the 6\u20130 start of the 2002\u201303 team and the Wolverines' first defeat of consecutive top-10 opponents since the 1996\u201397 team defeated #10 Duke and #6 Arizona. It was the first time Michigan defeated consecutive top-10 opponents in consecutive games since the 1992\u201393 team defeated #5 North Carolina and #2 Kansas in December 1992. Stauskas tied his career high of 26 points, with five rebounds and five assists. On January 25, ESPN's College GameDay covered the Michigan-Michigan State rivalry game. With Michigan State on an 11-game winning streak (including seven in conference) and Michigan on an eight-game winning streak (including six in conference), the game was the first time in Big Ten history that two teams met who were 6\u20130 or better in conference play. Michigan defeated the (#3, #3) Spartans 80\u201375, with Stauskas and Walton contributing 19 points apiece. It was the first time in school history that the team defeated three consecutive AP Poll top-10 opponents, and the first time since the 2006\u201307 Florida Gators that any team\u2014and the first time since the 1986\u201387 Iowa Hawkeyes that a Big Ten team\u2014won three consecutive games against top-10 opponents. It gave the team consecutive road wins against top-five opponents after a 36-game losing streak against them. Michigan's 7\u20130 Big Ten start was its best since the 1976\u201377 Wolverines won their first eight games. Stauskas was the Big Ten and CBS Sports National Player of the Week, and Walton was the Big Ten Freshman of the Week on January 27. Stauskas was also named the Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) on January 28. Michigan extended its winning streak to 10 games, tying its 1976\u201377 8\u20130 Big Ten start by beating Purdue. Caris LeVert had his first double-double, with a career-high 11 rebounds.\n\nParagraph 19: A much rarer but still observed process, according to some linguists, is the formation of mixed languages. Whereas creoles are formed by communities lacking a common language, mixed languages are formed by communities fluent in both languages. They tend to inherit much more of the complexity (grammatical, phonological, etc.) of their parent languages, whereas creoles begin as simple languages and then develop in complexity more independently. It is sometimes explained as bilingual communities that no longer identify with the cultures of either of the languages they speak, and seek to develop their own language as an expression of their own cultural uniqueness.\n\nParagraph 20: Tobrova ts\u00e4sson is a small fir wood cross-beam building that has a square floor plan; it is connected by fishtail tenons in the corner. Corner tenons are axe-hewn; the walls of the building have also been hewn from the inside. Some of the wall beams have been replaced by newer ones: the lower log row in the entire building, two lower beams on the north-east side and two lower beams on the northern corner. The wall beams of the building in the corners and in the middle of the wall are standing on granite stones. The dimensions of the ts\u00e4sson are 508 x 332\u00a0cm; the building has one interior room (12.3 m2) and an outer shelter of 2.3 m2. The entrance-room has square beam posts and a vertical boarding barrier. The supporting posts and barrier of the entrance-room has been replaced a few decades ago; a bit earlier, wider, sawn, vertical boards fixed side-by-side were used at the lower part of the barrier. Back then, the posts were axe-hewn square beams. The ceiling of the ts\u00e4sson is finished by wide boarding, hammered to the rafters and forming a roof-ceiling. There are no ceiling-beams. The building stands on granite stones. The height of the wall from the ground up to where the rafters are attached is 188\u00a0cm and the height up to the ridge is 366\u00a0cm. The photos of 1974 and 1980 show that the building had a shingle roof that was in good condition, and now has eternit sheets on top of it. The ridge has a simple forged cross on it. A faded entry icon is under the eaves. The floor is made from hand hewn and dressed boards. The building has a door (92 x 146\u00a0cm) made from boards fixed on the crosspiece and attached on the hewn tender posts. Forged hinges with tips resembling bird heads are on the door. From the inside, the door does not have a finishing; sheeting with fishtail fluting is hammered on the outside. There is an alms box outside next to the door. The eastern side of the building has a wooden window with a single frame and three panes. The window with a trapdoor opens on the inside. The building has been inventoried during 1974. Fr. Dr. Fr. R. Kreutzwald Memorial Museum expedition. A photo was taken of the ts\u00e4sson and icons and an inventory record was drawn up where the structure of the building and the icons were described. Tobrova ts\u00e4sson is said to be one of the best preserved ts\u00e4sson in Merem\u00e4e rural municipality on the inventory record (Kupp 1974). The outer look of the ts\u00e4sson has not changed much compared to 1974.\n\nParagraph 21: Featuring two BCS top-10 match-ups (No. 3 Oregon at No. 5 Stanford and No. 10 Oklahoma at No. 6 Baylor), the night of November 7 was tabbed by some in the media as the biggest Thursday night in college football history.  The first quarter and a half of the Baylor\u2013Oklahoma ballgame proved to be a low-scoring, defensive struggle.  Baylor won the coin toss and elected to receive; the Bears' first offensive possession ended in a punt.  Baylor's defense subsequently forced a 3-and-out, and Aaron Jones put the Bears ahead with a 29-yard field goal on Baylor's second possession of the game.  The Bears again forced a Sooners 3-and-out on Oklahoma's next possession, but Baylor's ensuing drive was stopped by the Oklahoma defense.  Following a Spencer Roth punt, the Sooners took possession at their own 29 yard line.  Although Oklahoma could not pick up a first down against the Baylor defense, the Sooners nonetheless found themselves with first down and goal from the Baylor 7-yard line following 53 penalty yards against Baylor; 38 of those yards came on a single play in which KJ Morton was flagged for targeting and Ahmad Dixon was hit with two flags for unsportsmanlike conduct.  Baylor's defense subsequently turned in a goal-line stand, resisting two Blake Bell rushes from inside the Bears' 2-yard line.  KJ Morton (whose targeting ejection had been overturned on review) brought Bell down on fourth and goal to force the turnover on downs.  However, after Baylor's offense took possession under the shadow of their own goalposts, the Sooner defense put up Oklahoma's first points of the game two plays later, sacking QB Bryce Petty in the endzone for a safety.  Jalen Saunders returned the ensuing Baylor free kick to the Bears' 12 yard line, but the Baylor defense again stood firm, forcing a 3-and-out and holding the Sooners to a field goal that gave Oklahoma its first lead of the game.  Both teams would end their next possessions with missed field goals before Baylor scored the first touchdown of the night on a 5-yard Bryce Petty rush.  Oklahoma would be forced to punt on their next possession and the ensuing 93-yard Baylor drive would end with a second rushing touchdown from Petty.  On the Sooners' next play from scrimmage, linebacker Eddie Lackey picked off Blake Bell to set up a touchdown pass from Petty to Antwan Goodley with 13 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter.  The teams entered the half with Baylor leading 24\u20135.\n\nParagraph 22: After starting out with the team in the late 1980s as a trainee and having two loan spells away, at Ipswich Town and Oxford United Walker played in the winning 1989\u201390 FA Youth Cup Tottenham team overcoming Middlesbrough. During the early 1990s Walker was mainly used as the reserve keeper, making the odd cup appearance along the way, but after a serious injury to then Spurs keeper Erik Thorstvedt Walker took his chance and soon became the number 1 at Spurs, cementing his place in the side and getting his chance in the team during the first season of the Premiership making a total of 17 appearances in the league. 1992\u201393 season. Walker went on and made a total of 312 appearances for Tottenham Hotspur and played a big part during the 1999 season in helping Spurs win the 1999 Football League Cup Final after beating Leicester City 1\u20130 at Wembley Stadium. During the latter stages of Walkers career at Spurs he fell out of favour with the management and lost his place to the newly signed Neil Sullivan it was shortly after this, that the England international handed in a transfer request in September 2000. He played his final game for Spurs against West Ham United on 31 January 2001.\n\nParagraph 23: Toubou Teda allege and refer to their slaves as Kamadja, their authentic designation deliberately, which is a misinterpretation of Kamaya, who are grudgingly attempting to derogate the Toubou Gourane Kamaya clans' federation because the Kamaya's history was fabricated by the French colonists. In addition, the tone terms, such as Kamadja for the male plural and also it can be used as a general and Kamadji for the male singular, all of these terms can be used, although they have no meaning. The female singular Kamadjedo or Kamadjero is preposterous and nonsensical, while the plural form of the female term, Kamadjeda, has an exceedingly bizarre and illogical tone. The term \"Kamadja\" is somewhat stuck and fading on the ethnic group Kamaya which does not recognize itself in it and it was originated and peddled by the French colonists, however, it is believed to be misquoted, misconstrued, and distorted the letters \"Y\" to \"J\" or \"Dj\" in the identities of a multitude of clans, tribes, communities, rural areas, living creatures, and many more across virtually the entire nation of Chad and also the 1869 writings of Dr. Gustav Nichtigal contain references to various inaccuracies, such as the Yira clan as Jira, the Yenoa clan as Jenoa, the Yin oasis as Jin, and the Yarda oasis as Jarda, the Faya oasis as Faja, the Bidayet community as Bidajet, the Goli Yeskou as Goli Jeskou (Black snake), etc. Dr. G. Nichtigal gathered intelligence for the German government in order to colonize these regions; however, Chad became part of the French empire when they divided the African continent, and thus the French invaders exploited Dr. G. Nichtigal's works in order to invade Chad. In direct relation to the Kamadja term, neither the Tedaga nor the Dazaga languages have the term \"Kamadja\u201d. On the other hand, the significance of the designation Kamaya has value, meaning and history that derived from \"Kama-Dro-Y\u00e9d\u00e9\", which refers to the valley's occupant of the Faya oasis in Kanem Dazaga's dialect, where \"Kama\" signifies valley, \"Dro\" signifies inside, and \"Y\u00e9d\u00e9\" signifies a dweller. \"Y\u00e9\" signifies dwells and \"D\u00e9\" is the signifier of a singular form which \"Kama-Dro-Y\u00e9d\u00e9\" literally states \"who dwells in the valley\" of the palm grove of Faya oasis.  The clans of Kamaya were originally referred to as \"Kamayada\" where \"Ya\" means dwell and \"Da\" is the signifier of the plural form, while \"Kamay\u00e9d\u00e9\" is a singular form that signifies an inhabitant of the valley of Faya palm grove oasis, since the suffix \"D\u00e9\" is added to the singular form of \"Y\u00e9\u201d. Thus, Kamaya means the natives of the valley of the palm grove of Faya oasis. In Dazaga, the community is called \"Kama-Yanga\". Which means the Kamaya canton and the suffix \"Ga\" implies the dialect spoken by the Dazagada. In this language, the nationals of this canton are referred to as \"Kamaye\" (male singular), \"Kamayedo\" or \"Kamayero\" (female singular) and depends on the accents of specific regions and individuals, the suffix may be pronounced differently from \u201cDo\u201d to \u201cRo\u201d, \"Kamayeda\" (female plural), and \"Kamaya\" (male plural and as a general).\n\nParagraph 24: As the commander of the 3rd Division, Brivonesi was the protagonist of the Italian defeat in the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy. On 8 November 1941, Brivonesi sailed from Messina with Trieste, Trento and the 13th Destroyer Flotilla (Granatiere, Bersagliere, Fuciliere, Alpino) as distant escort of the \"Beta\" convoy (later known as the \"Duisburg\" convoy), which consisted in 7 merchant ships (the Italian cargo ships Maria, Sagitta and Rina Corrado, the Italian tankers Conte di Misurata and Minatitlan and the German cargo ships Duisburg and San Marco, laden with 389 vehicles, 34,473 long tons of munitions and mat\u00e9riel and 17,281 long tons of fuel) with a close escort of six destroyers (under the command of Captain Ugo Bisciani on Maestrale). The convoy was spotted by a British reconnaissance plane, and Force K (light cruisers Aurora and Penelope and destroyers Lance and Lively) sailed from Malta to intercept. The attack happened during the following night; Force K took the close escort by surprise, sank one destroyer (Fulmine) and disabled another (Grecale), then proceeded to sink all the seven merchants, while the confused and disarticulated reaction of the other destroyers (left without orders, as Maestrale's radio antenna was shot away) was unable to stop or damage the British ships. Brivonesi's 3rd Division, at the time of the attack (00:57 on 9 November), was sailing at 12 knots about three miles astern and to the east of the convoy. The Division only realized that the convoy was being attacked when they spotted the flash of the British guns; shortly before, at 00:30, Trieste had intercepted a coded message of unknown source and meaning (the source was Force K), and Brivonesi was about to send a general alert to all his ships, when the battle started. Trieste and Trento opened fire on Force K at 1:03, from a distance of 9,000-10,000 meters; Brivonesi's subsequent manoeuvre later drew heavy criticism: instead of turning southeast, where Force K was, to close in on the British ships and attack them at once, he turned starboard so that his cruisers could bring all guns to bear, which required several minutes. Brivonesi's ships briefly assumed a southerly course (thus distancing themselves from Force K even more), then turned to port and then to starboard, advancing at a speed of only 15-16 knots, less than half the speed that they could keep. Force K kept manoeuvring around the convoy so that the latter was constantly between the British ships and the Italian Division, which caused the blazing merchants and their smoke to hamper the aim of the Italian gunners. At 1:12 Brivonesi ordered to increase speed to 18 knots and at 1:25 to 24 knots, but by then the distance had risen to 17,000 meters, and he ordered to cease fire, as it was pointless. At 1:29 Brivonesi ordered to turn north, in order to intercept the Force K when the latter would turn back towards Malta (by then the convoy was completely destroyed). Meanwhile, however, Supermarina (the Italian Navy high command) had informed him that the risk of a torpedo bomber attack on his ships was high; as they were outside of Malta's aircraft's reach, Brivonesi believed that a British aircraft carrier was in the area. Upon realizing that the fires of the disabled merchant ships lighted up his ships, making them easier targets for submarines as well as aircraft, Brivonesi ordered to cease fire, leave the area and assume a northwesterly course, at 1:32. Overall, Trieste and Trento had fired 207 8-inch shells, without scoring any hits. The 3rd Division only returned to the area after a few hours, to cover the search and rescue operation, during which the destroyer Libeccio was sunk by HMS Upholder and Trento was narrowly missed by a torpedo.\n\nParagraph 25: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty, in action on the western ridge of Mount Altuzzo, Italy. After bitter fighting his company had advanced to within 50 yards of the objective, where it was held up due to intense enemy sniper, automatic, small arms, and mortar fire. The enemy launched 3 desperate counterattacks in an effort to regain their former positions, but all 3 were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides. All officers and noncommissioned officers of the 2d and 3d platoons of Company B had become casualties, and S/Sgt. Keathley, guide of the 1st platoon, moved up and assumed command of both the 2d and 3d platoons, reduced to 20 men. The remnants of the 2 platoons were dangerously low on ammunition, so S/Sgt. Keathley, under deadly small arms and mortar fire, crawled from 1 casualty to another, collecting their ammunition and administering first aid. He then visited each man of his 2 platoons, issuing the precious ammunition he had collected from the dead and wounded, and giving them words of encouragement. The enemy now delivered their fourth counterattack, which was approximately 2 companies in strength. In a furious charge they attacked from the front and both flanks, throwing hand grenades, firing automatic weapons, and assisted by a terrific mortar barrage. So strong was the enemy counterattack that the company was given up for lost. The remnants of the 2d and 3d platoons of Company B were now looking to S/Sgt. Keathley for leadership. He shouted his orders precisely and with determination and the men responded with all that was in them. Time after time the enemy tried to drive a wedge into S/Sgt. Keathley's position and each time they were driven back, suffering huge casualties. Suddenly an enemy hand grenade hit and exploded near S/Sgt. Keathley, inflicting a mortal wound in his left side. However, hurling defiance at the enemy, he rose to his feet. Taking his left hand away from his wound and using it to steady his rifle, he fired and killed an attacking enemy soldier, and continued shouting orders to his men. His heroic and intrepid action so inspired his men that they fought with incomparable determination and viciousness. For 15 minutes S/Sgt. Keathley continued leading his men and effectively firing his rifle. He could have sought a sheltered spot and perhaps saved his life, but instead he elected to set an example for his men and make every possible effort to hold his position. Finally, friendly artillery fire helped to force the enemy to withdraw, leaving behind many of their number either dead or seriously wounded. S/Sgt. Keathley died a few moments later. Had it not been for his indomitable courage and incomparable heroism, the remnants of 3 rifle platoons of Company B might well have been annihilated by the overwhelming enemy attacking force. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nParagraph 26: Ten years after Jenny's death, Bette is running for Mayor of Los Angeles. It is revealed that during the last ten years, Bette and Tina did get married, but also got divorced after Tina left Bette for another woman, Carrie, with Bette getting at least partial custody of Angelica, who now lives with her. Bette refuses campaign funding from Dani N\u00f9\u00f1ez, a PR executive for her father's company which invests in opioids, but Dani has a change of heart and resigns in order to work for Bette. Also seeking to sabotage Bette's campaign is Tyler Adams, as Bette once slept with his closeted lesbian ex-wife, Felicity. In response, Bette goes on Alice's new television show to tell her side of the story and arranges an interview with Felicity, with whom she renews her affair. On Dani's advice, Bette breaks up with Felicity to avoid further controversy, and in retaliation, Felicity tips Tyler and the press off about their renewed affair, putting her campaign in jeopardy once again when Tyler confronts her and Bette is forced to punch him to protect Angelica. Bette finally reveals to the press that her reason for running for mayor is that Kit died of an opioid overdose, and enrolls Angelica in a public school when she is suspended by her racist and homophobic private school for physically defending Bette against a classmate, winning her a grant from the teachers' union. At the same time, Tina visits Bette and Angelica to offer her support. Despite their troubled past, Bette hopes to renew her relationship with Tina, but Tina privately reveals to Bette that she is marrying Carrie and they moving to Los Angeles so that they can be closer to Angelica. Ultimately, Bette loses the election to her far-right conservative rival, Jeff Milner, who had aired several campaign commercials which denounced Bette's moral values. Bette goes to grieve for Kit with Angelica where her ashes were scattered. In the process, she runs into Maya, a lesbian reporter who was covering her campaign, and accepts a dinner invitation from her.\n\nParagraph 27: Less than a month after American Idol'''s first season finale, Day reunited with the top thirty contestants to perform in the two-hour American Idol in Las Vegas TV special. Day then participated through October and November in the 2002 American Idols LIVE! tour, along with his fellow top ten finalists. Each of this tour's thirty shows was opened by Day singing Janet Jackson's \"Black Cat\". To usher in 2003, Day performed in Pasadena, California's New Year's Day Rose Parade. Paired with eighth place finalist AJ Gil on a float for Give Kids the World, the two sang \"Calling All Angels\", a song which had been specifically written for the charity organization. The band OTown also participated in this float. Day and Gil would subsequently perform \"Calling All Angels\" at an Orlando, Florida fundraising gala in June and release this duet as a single through Give Kids the World. Later that year, Day participated in further fundraising events, such as the Hollywood Knights Season Wrap Party in Los Angeles and NSYNC's Challenge for the Children event in Miami. Throughout the Spring, Day participated in Coca-Cola's Behind the Scenes With American Idol promotional tour, in which he and a selection of other finalists from the first two seasons of the series performed in shopping malls owned by the Simon Property Group.   Around this time, Day also performed the National Anthem for a variety of professional Georgia sports teams, such as the Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta Thrashers. In November, Day performed along with Edwin McCain and American Idol second season finalist Vanessa Olivarez in a tree lighting ceremony at the World of Coca-Cola.\n\nParagraph 28: Ali was one of several men hired by the United States Army to introduce camels as beasts of burden to transport cargo across the \"Great American Desert.\" Eight of the men \u2013 including Ali \u2013 were of Greek origin. They arrived at the Port of Indianola in Calhoun County, Texas on the . The book Go West Greek George by Steven Dean Pastis, published in both Greek and English, specifically identifies all eight men. These pioneers were Yiorgos Caralambo (later known as Greek George), Hadji Ali (Hi Jolly, a.k.a. Philip Tedro), Mimico Teodora (Mico), Hadjiatis Yannaco (Long Tom), Anastasio Coralli (Short Tom), Michelo Georgios, Yanni Iliato, and Giorgios Costi. The Americans acquired three camels in Tunis, nine in Egypt, and 21 in Smyrna: 33 in all. Ali was the lead camel driver during the US Army's experiment with the U.S. Camel Corps in using camels in the dry deserts of the Southwest. After successfully traveling round trip from Texas to California, the experiment failed, partly due to the problem that the Army's burros, horses, and mules feared the large animals, often panicking, and the tensions of the American Civil War led to Congress not approving more funds for the Corps. In 1864, the camels were finally auctioned off in Benicia, California, and Camp Verde, Texas. Ali was discharged from the Quartermaster Department of the U.S. Army at Fort McDowell in 1870.\n\nParagraph 29: A school teacher begins a musical lesson to a classroom of children with recorders. One child asks if it is \"Three Blind Mice\" while the teacher says \"Hot Cross Buns\". As they play, the children's eyes glow and \"x\"'s appear on their forehead. Ten years later, he sits on a couch with his wife Kim, a Korean policewoman. He remarks his marriage has put \"Hot Cross Buns\" behind him which confuses Kim. A melody starts from another room and he asks about it. Kim says she found a box of recorders in the attic and their daughter Christine is practicing \"Three Blind Mice\". He says it is not \"Three Blind Mice\" but \"Hot Cross Buns\". Both parents go to Christine's bedroom to find she is playing the song. He tries to dissuade her from playing \"Hot Cross Buns\" with \"Three Blind Mice\". However, Christine continues with the same song and her eyes glow and a \"x\" appears on her forehead. He explains it is a mark for an otherworldly monster \"Hot Cross Buns\" who will claim their daughter as its own. He explains that this was his life when Kim says this is illegal. Despite this, he pulls out a recorder and plays the song causing him to disappear into another reality. In front of a castle, he asks the guard to see the three blind mice inside. The guard declines his request yet he persists. As things ensue, he recalls Kim's plea to abstain from illegalism. Regardless, he chokes the guard. After, he confronts the three blind mice who implore him to confront the beast with a pure heart. Instead, he requests magic from them. The mice reply magic of a pure heart is all that is needed when he sees their magic sceptre. Distracting the blind mice, he then steals it which cause them to die. Atop the castle, he uses the sceptre to summon the beast. Hot Cross Buns says the magic sceptre cannot kill him due to the ways of the three blind mice. The beast also invades his mind. The memory of Kim arrests him for illegal mind invasion. Distracting Hot Cross Buns, he then kills the beast. Returning to his home, he finds his daughter dead and Kim explains the circumstance. In a flashback, Hot Cross Buns says his life was linked with Christine. Nevertheless, he proceeds to sing the song one last time.\n\nParagraph 30: Laneco was founded by Raymond A. Bartolacci Sr. in 1946. The first store opened as Paramount Foods in Easton, Pennsylvania, and completed its first day of business with a total of less than $20 in sales. The stores were acquired by Supervalu in October 1992, and were closed by them in 2001. The stores were scaled down for the last several years until they were closed. The stores operated with a union and several thousand employees were laid off at the closure of the stores. Laneco had around 16 stores at the time of closure. Many stores were purchased by and converted to Giant such as the Lehighton, PA location, while Redner's picked up a few locations, Country Junction took over the Wind Gap store, Ahart's Market operated a few locations such as the former Food Lanes in Allentown and Bethlehem PA and Phillipsburg, NJ (all of which have since closed). The Clinton and the Whitehouse (now closed) SuperCenters in New Jersey are now Wal-Mart stores and the Laneco in Phillipsburg was demolished, with a Wal-Mart, a White Castle, a Wawa, and a Quaker Steak & Lube which got replaced by Stone Tavern now occupying the redeveloped site. The Hometown, PA Laneco would become a TJ Bart's location before eventually closing and the lot being used to build a Wal-Mart. Giant refused to hire any of the ex-Laneco workers because they were members of a union.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nMichigan had a successful start to their Big Ten Conference season, winning multiple games against top-ranked opponents.

He remembered his oncologist telling him to think of chemotherapy as eating cancer cells. When Make-A-Wish first approached gaming companies - their requests to help create a cancer-fighting video game were denied. Make-a-Wish Executive Director Patricia Wilson was told that a video game would take upwards of US$1,000,000 and possibly years to create. Ms. Wilson sought the help of her Board of Directors and within days the request to fulfill Ben's wish was posted on several gaming sites. Inquiries and offers to assist began immediately from game designers in the UK, Israel, Canada and the United States. One particular offer came from a Bay Area game designer who offered to spearhead the entire game design on one condition: that he have a chance to meet and work with Ben directly. Eric Johnston, a software engineer from LucasArts met with Ben weekly for 6 months and together, they created Ben's Game. Ben's own pediatric oncologist served as medical adviser for the game upon condition that UCSF Children's Hospital be the first medical facility to have the game installed for children to play.\n\nParagraph 2: Predecessor units trace their origins to 1795, and since 1949 Royal Newfoundland Regiment has been a unit of the Canadian Army. During the First World War the battalion-sized Newfoundland Regiment was the only North American unit to fight in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915. Later in the war the regiment was virtually wiped out at Beaumont Hamel on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, but was rebuilt and continued to serve throughout France and Belgium until the armistice, serving as part of the British Army of the Rhine in 1919. In December 1917, George V bestowed the regiment with the right to use the prefix royal before its name. It was the only military unit to receive this honour during the First World War.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1910 Edwin was living in the Bronx, New York and working as a cotton goods salesman. Around 1911 he moved the family from the Bronx to Hollis, Queens. He registered for the draft on September 12, 1918, but did not serve in World War I. He became a Democratic party ward heeler for Tammany Hall, and was appointed as the Commissioner of Public Markets for New York City by mayor John F. Hylan.  He testified on August 18, 1922 before the Kings County, New York Grand Jury, which was investigating the mishandling of the fees paid by vendors to the Public Markets office. No charges were filed.\n\nParagraph 4: At a Christmas lecture, a nun named Sister Mary Ignatius explains to the audience the basic tenets of Catholicism. She is assisted by her favorite student, seven-year-old Thomas. From time to time, she asks him catechism questions and gives him a cookie for every right answer. Half-way into her speech, four of her former students, Gary Sullivan, Diane Symonds, Philomena Rostovich, and Aloysius Benheim, enter dressed as St. Joseph, The Virgin Mary, and two halves of a camel. The four remind Sister that she had asked them to come in and perform the pageant they once performed in her class. After the pageant, it becomes apparent that the four have strayed from her teaching; Diane has had two abortions (the first one from a rape at age 18), Philomena is an unwed mother, Aloysius is an alcoholic who beats his wife and is thinking about suicide, and Gary is gay. They reveal that they were never asked to come in and merely wanted to embarrass Sister. They each have their own reason for hating her; Aloysius was refused bathroom privileges frequently and now has bladder problems, Philomena recalls being hit by Sister for being a poor student, Gary is there on behalf of his boyfriend Jeff, and Diane had believed Sister until her world came crashing down when her mother died of breast cancer and she was raped the same day. Diane reveals that she has brought a gun to kill Sister, something the other three were not aware of. Sister grabs a gun from behind her lectern and shoots Diane in self-defense. She also shoots Gary, proclaiming that she has sent him to heaven, as he went to confession earlier that day. She then points the gun at Aloysius, who needs to go to the bathroom, before handing it to Thomas to take a nap. The play ends with Thomas pointing the gun at Aloysius while explaining the perfections of God, Diane and Gary's dead bodies on the floor, and Sister asleep.\n\nParagraph 5: The Falcon is the nickname for two fictional detectives. Drexel Drake (real name Charles H. Huff) created Michael Waring, alias the Falcon, a freelance investigator and troubleshooter, in his 1936 novel, The Falcon's Prey. It was followed by two more novels \u2013 The Falcon Cuts In, 1937, and The Falcon Meets a Lady, 1938 \u2013 and a 1938 short story. Michael Arlen created Gay Stanhope Falcon in 1940. This Falcon made his first appearance in Arlen's short story \"Gay Falcon\" (aka \"A Man Called Falcon\"), which was originally published in 1940 in Town & Country magazine. The story opens with the words \"Now of this man who called himself Gay Falcon many tales are told, and this is one of them.\" Arlen's Falcon is characterized as a freelance adventurer and troubleshooter \u2013 a man who makes his living \"keeping his mouth shut and engaging in dangerous enterprises.\"\n\nParagraph 6: The aspirational age can be identified as the age of which consumers associate positive experiences with, such as freedom. For example, most adults are preoccupied with day-to-day responsibilities which can be viewed as stressful. Marketing to the aspirational age therefore, allows businesses to attract a generation of nostalgic consumers. The aspirational age as a tool is thus essentially modelled on the notion of nostalgia. From the adult's perspective, the psychology behind the 'aspirational age' can be defined as a recapture of youthful days. 'High-speed modern living, stress and the impact of recession' have all been considered as factors which influence a consumer's longing of their 'aspirational age'.\n\nParagraph 7: The Assassin (2015)The Assassin (2015) was Hou's eighteenth feature film and garnered him the Best Director award at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where composer Giong Lim also won the Cannes Soundtrack Award. The film also swept the 2015 Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards, winning a grand total of five awards: Best Director, Best Feature Film, Best Cinematography (Ping Bin Lee), Best Makeup & Costume Design (Wen-Ying Huang), and Best Sound Effects (Duu-Chih Tu, Shih Yi Chu, Shu-yao Wu).> The film was also nominated for 5 additional Golden Horse awards: Best Leading Actress (Shi Qu), Best Adapted Screenplay (Cheng Ah, Chu T\u2019ien-wen and Hai-Meng Hsieh), Best Art Direction (Wen-Ying Huang), Best Original Film Score (Giong Lim) and Best Film Editing (Ching-Song Liao). The film was also nominated for a BAFTA Award for \"Best Foreign Language Film\", but lost to Wild Tales.The Assassin also won a Best Foreign Language Film award from the 2015 Florida Film Critics Circle Awards, a \"Best Film Not in the English Language\" award from the Online Film Critics Society (where it was also nominated for a Best Cinematography award for DP Ping Bin Lee), and a Best Foreign Language film award from the Vancouver Film Critics Circle in 2016. The film also won 2nd place for a Best Foreign Language Film award from the Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association in 2015, 3rd place in a 2015 indieWire Critics' Poll for Best Director and Best Cinematography (Ping Bin Lee), where it also received an 8th place for Best Film and a 9th place for Best Editing (Chih-Chia Huang), and 2nd place for a Best Foreign Language Film Award from the Southeastern Film Critics Association Awards in 2015.\n\nParagraph 8: During the Second World War, Constantine worked for the Ministry of Labour and National Service as a Welfare Officer responsible for West Indians employed in English factories. In 1943, the manager of a London hotel refused to accommodate Constantine and his family on the grounds of their race in an instance of the UK colour bar; Constantine successfully sued the hotel company. Commentators recognise the case as a milestone in British racial equality. Constantine qualified as a barrister in 1954, while also establishing himself as a journalist and broadcaster. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1954, entered politics and became a founding member of the People's National Movement, subsequently entering the government as minister of communications. From 1961 to 1964, he served as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and, controversially, became involved in issues relating to racial discrimination, including the Bristol Bus Boycott. In his final years, he served on the Race Relations Board, the Sports Council and the Board of Governors of the BBC. Failing health reduced his effectiveness in some of these roles, and he faced criticism for becoming a part of the British Establishment. He died of a heart attack on 1 July 1971, aged 69. In June 2021, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame as one of the special inductees to mark the inaugural edition of the ICC World Test Championship final.\n\nParagraph 9: Clea is the Sorceress Supreme of the Dark Dimension, possessing vast powers involving the manipulation of the forces of magic for a variety of effects. She has exhibited such abilities as transmutation, forming and throwing magical bolts of concussive energy, magically constructed animate beings, conjuring objects and energies, teleporting, telekinesis, levitation, mesmerism, thought-casting, controlling others' minds, casting illusions, and the tapping of extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. Presumably, she is capable of replicating any spell performed by her former mentor, Doctor Strange. As she is descended from the Faltine race of beings, it is suggested that she can generate her own mystical energy, like Umar and Dormammu, and draw upon it to fuel her magic. She also possesses greater strength and body density than that of a normal Earth human. Her age is indeterminate and the rate at which she ages is unknown since she has lived for centuries but has the form and demeanour of a twenty-year-old woman. Clea has defeated the Enchantress in single magical combat, and armed with the Flames of Regency, at the peak of her magical abilities, even rivalled her mother Umar in raw power.\n\nParagraph 10: Several rounds of intense severe thunderstorms brought significant damaging winds, very large hail, and several tornadoes primarily across the Southern United States from April\u00a09 into the evening of April\u00a011. April\u00a09 started with several clusters of multi-cells, supercells, and bowing segments across much of the Deep South. Strong straight-line thunderstorm winds in Shreveport, Louisiana toppled a tree onto a mobile home around 6:30\u00a0p.m. (23:30\u00a0UTC), resulting in a fatality. Several large hail-producing supercells then formed and moved through areas from Oklahoma to North Texas before merging into a large squall line and surging southeastward into Arkansas and Louisiana, producing widespread wind damage. Meanwhile, several tornado-producing supercells formed ahead of the line. A weak EF0\u00a0tornado was recorded by several storm spotters near Pelahatchie, Mississippi, causing intermittent tree damage. Just after midnight on April\u00a010, a large EF1\u00a0tornado ripped roofs off of sheds and carports and knocked down trees, including some that fell on homes, near Columbia, Mississippi. To the southwest, a low-end EF3\u00a0tornado tossed vehicles and damaged or destroyed several homes and mobile homes in the rural community of Waxia near Palmetto, Louisiana just after 2:00\u00a0a.m. CDT (07:00\u00a0UTC), resulting in one fatality and seven injuries. Later that morning, the squall line produced multiple tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle. A strong tornadic waterspout came onshore in Laguna Beach, Florida, causing severe EF2\u00a0damage to a business and damaging several homes. Another tornadic waterspout struck Gulf Lagoon Beach, located at the southeastern edge of the Panama City Beach city limits and caused EF0 damage to beach furniture. In Lynn Haven, an EF1\u00a0tornado caused considerable damage to an automotive business. That afternoon, isolated to widely scattered severe storms formed from the Great Lakes to the Carolinas, producing sporadic wind and hail damage as well as isolated tornadoes into the overnight hours. An EF1\u00a0tornado also caused damage to businesses and a radio tower, and flipped a car near Seneca, South Carolina. A brief EF0\u00a0tornado damaged a few homes near Cutlerville, Michigan, and another EF0\u00a0tornado damaged a home near Reidville, South Carolina. Early on April\u00a011, another EF1\u00a0tornado caused damage to homes and outbuildings near Belvoir, North Carolina. That afternoon, another squall line pushed southeastward down the entire Florida panhandle, producing mainly wind and hail damage, although a brief EF0\u00a0tornado that caused minor tree damage was confirmed near Eagle Lake. Another non-tornadic fatality occurred near Spring Hill when a person got out of their car after it was struck by a fallen tree and was electrocuted when they came in contact with downed power lines. Overall, the outbreak generated 20\u00a0tornadoes, resulting in one fatality. Two other non-tornadic deaths also occurred as a result of the severe weather. There was also at least $635 million in damage.\n\nParagraph 11: Heading into Slammiversary, Matt Morgan expressed his wishes to join the Mafia. This would lead to Angle facing Morgan in a singles match on TNA Impact! which Angle would win. After the match, Angle shook Morgan's hand, showing that he would want him in the MEM. On the following week's TNA Impact!, during a King of the Mountain qualification match between Angle and Sting, Morgan interfered and helped Angle win. After the match, Angle thanked Morgan for helping him win. Morgan would go on and ask Sting to let him become a member of the MEM. Sting agreed to a match at Slammiversary against Morgan where, if Morgan won, he could join the group. Sting went on to defeat Morgan at the pay-per-view. In the final match of the pay-per-view, Angle won the King of the Mountain match to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Samoa Joe turned heel and joined the MEM by handing him the World Heavyweight Championship belt, backstabbing the TNA Front Line in the process. On the June 25 edition of TNA Impact!, it was explained that Joe had been paid off by the MEM due to them being unable to defeat him. The MEM, as well as Morgan, attacked Sting in disapproval of his leadership, with Angle announcing that he had regained leadership of the group. The following week, Sting saved A.J. Styles from a beat down from his former stablemates, attacking each member of the MEM with his baseball bat and stealing Angle's TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt. The following week, Sting confronted Samoa Joe, claiming to unveil Joe's mystery adviser before Victory Road, where he would be facing Samoa Joe. Later on in the show, Sting disguised himself as Joe and nearly dragged out Joe's adviser from his car, before Joe stopped him, choking him out with the Coquina Clutch and his signature tribal knife. Joe then took back the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, returning it to Angle during the beatdown on Mick Foley at the end of the show. At Victory Road, the MEM gained full control of TNA's championship scene as Nash won the TNA Legends Championship from A.J. Styles to bring the title back to the MEM. At the same event, Booker and Steiner defeated Beer Money, Inc. for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, Angle defeated Foley to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and Taz was also revealed to be Joe's adviser; Taz would later state that he was just an associate of the MEM. On the July 30 episode of TNA Impact!, Kevin Nash lost the TNA Legends Championship to Mick Foley in a tag team match with Kurt Angle against Bobby Lashley and Mick Foley.\n\nParagraph 12: Before WCKT signed on, NBC programming had been carried on Fort Lauderdale's WFTL-TV (channel 23, later known as WGBS-TV after it had been acquired by Storer Broadcasting), which also held a secondary affiliation with the DuMont Television Network. However, WFTL struggled because television sets were not required to have UHF tuning capability (the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would later require such tuners to be included in sets manufactured from 1964 onward). It didn't help matters that much of the area, particularly Fort Lauderdale, got a fairly strong signal from WJNO-TV (channel 5, now WPTV) in West Palm Beach. When the Cox/Knight partnership won a construction permit and broadcast license to operate a station on VHF channel 7, NBC quickly agreed to move its affiliation to WCKT, since WCKR radio had been the longtime Miami affiliate of the NBC Blue Network (the forerunner to today's American Broadcasting Company (ABC)). Until WPST-TV (channel 10, now WPLG) signed on in August 1957, WCKT also shared ABC programming with WTVJ (channel 4), as part of an arrangement with the network to provide its programming throughout the market as television sets were not required to have UHF tuning capability at the time, preventing many in the area from receiving the market's original ABC affiliate, WITV (channel 17). Channel 23 became an independent station and eventually went dark, and later came back to the air in 1967 as WAJA-TV (it is now Univision flagship WLTV-DT).\n\nParagraph 13: The rebel princes generally came to a bad end: Zhuang Ji's former patron Liu Pi, ruler of Wu fled and was killed in flight by native Yue (a term used for various non-Han Chinese peoples), which people his duty had been to suppress, and his territory of Wu divided up among Liu Wu's sons. In contrast Zhuang Ji's patron Liu Wu was rewarded for his loyal support through the rebellion, his brother emperor Jingdi giving him honors and privileges. Liu Wu's private gardens rivaled the emperor's and he increased the number of his retinue, bringing in people whose actions would end up losing the favor he had gained with the emperor and leading to his eventual fall from grace. When Jingdi demoted his son Liu Rong from crown prince (taizi,  heir apparent), in 150 BCE, Liu Wu and Jingdi's mutual mother, empress dowager Dou took this opportunity to lobby for her son Jingdi to name her other son, Liu Wu, as crown prince and successor, rather than Jingdi promoting one of his sons to this position. Jingdi agreed initially, but was then talked out of it by advisors. For example, minister Yuan Ang warned strongly against this breaking of the laws of succession as a destabilizing precedent, appointing a brother rather than the usual practice of choosing a son. Proceeding in support of their patron, some of Liu Wu's new retainers then went out and murdered this minister, Yuan Ang, going on to commit a series of killings in the effort to regain their patron, Liu Wu's, position as crown prince and the opportunity to become emperor, if Jingdi were to suddenly die. When Jingdi found out about this intrigue, Liu Wu had his two retainers commit suicide, presenting their bodies to the emperor, in appeasement. Nevertheless, Liu Wu failed to regain favor after this, he was seldom received at court, and his half-nephew (the future emperor, Han Wudi) replaced him as crown prince. In another and related dangerous turn of events for Liu Wu, the new crown prince's mother Wang Zhi was promoted to first lady, consolidating power against him at court. However, Liu Wu did not loose support of all the powerful court females. His mother, empress dowager Dou, still supported him, refusing to eat until he was cleared of charges. After an official investigation, the report back to emperor Jingdi was that Liu Wu had been found to have been involved, that \"sparing the Prince of Liang would break the law of Han\", yet, \"killing him would deeply distress the Empress Dowager and upset the Emperor even more\", counseling Jingdi to drop the issue. In discussion with the women, he blamed the murders solely upon Liu Wu's two courtiers, now  dead and already lawfully punished. After returning from an unsuccessful trip to Chang'an, Liu Wu died at home in Liang, in 144\u2009BCE.\n\nParagraph 14: Murray was an outspoken activist at the forefront of the civil rights movement, alongside such leaders as Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. She coined the term Jane Crow, which demonstrated Murray's belief that Jim Crow laws also negatively affected African-American women. She was determined to work with other activists to put a halt to both racism and sexism. Murray's speech, \"Jim Crow and Jane Crow\", delivered in Washington, DC, in 1964, sheds light on the long struggle of African-American women for racial equality and their later fight for equality among the sexes. As she put it, \"Not only have they stood ... with Negro men in every phase of the battle, but they have also continued to stand when their men were destroyed by it.\" The black women decided to \"...continue ... [standing] ...\" for their freedom and liberty even when \"...their men ...\" began to experience exhaustion from a long struggle for civil rights. These women were unafraid to stand up for what they believed in and refused to back down from the long and tedious \"battle\".  Murray continued her praise for black women when she stated that \"...one cannot help asking: would the Negro struggle have come this far without the indomitable determination of its women?\" The \"Negro struggle\" was able to progress partly because of \"...the indomitable determination of its women.\"\n\nParagraph 15: Female.

With its ranks full of qualified tradesmen the battalion was quickly given its military indoctrination and processed in less than a month for transit to Port Hueneme, Ca.  From there the battalion boarded ship and was the first CB into the Hawaiian Territory.  \"NAS Honolulu\"  was actually Naval Air Station Barbers Point and it was on CB 5's work list.  Also on the list was Midway Atoll.  Sand Island had another airfield in need of attention.   Rounding out the first deployment were projects on French Frigate Shoals, Canton Island, Johnston Atoll and Palmyra atoll.  At French Frigate shoals an island had to be made for the base and airfield to be constructed upon. CB 5 was rotated CONUS on 19 March 1944, arriving Camp Parks, Ca on March 24. Five's Midway replacement was the 50th CB who arrived on April 4.   From Camp Parks the battalion was transferred to Port Hueneme.  While there the battalion was given its next assignment and attached to Cub-16.  That was canceled with the battalion attached to the 7th Fleet and General MacArthur.  On January 10, 1945 CB 5 departed Port Hueneme for Leyte where it arrived February 15.  Nine days later the battalion would land at it new job site on Calicoan, Samar.  The main projects would be an ABCD,  ACEPD,  NSD and roads and water supply for all of it.   At Calicoan CB 5 had divers doing shallow water work for a seaplane ramp.  There were several detachments, one to both Advance Base Unit 10(NABU-10) and NABU-12.  Able Company went to Balikpapan, Borneo to help the Aussies joining Detachments from the 111th and 113th CBs. On 13 August the battalion learned it was assigned Operation Olympic the first element of Operation Downfall.  Downfall was the plan for the invasion of Japan. Set to begin in November 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the Japanese island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b.  This was to be followed by Operation Coronet, the second element, which was planned to land near Tokyo. VJ-day terminated these Operations leaving NCB 5 in the Philippines.  CB 5 was then listed to be tasked to the Operation Beleaguer mission in China, but received notice mid-October that was canceled too.   Naval Construction Battalion 5 was deactivated on December 3, 1945.\n\nParagraph 17:  When consulted to broker peace during a later war, Sahl ibn Hunaif said, 'Blame yourselves! I remember how, on the day of Al-Hudaibiya, if we had been allowed to choose fighting, we would have fought (the pagans). At that time 'Umar came (to the Prophet) and said, \"Aren't we on the right (path) and they (pagans) in the wrong? Won't our killed persons go to Paradise, and theirs in the Fire?\" The Prophet replied, \"Yes.\" Umar further said, \"Then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before Allah has settled the matter between us?\" The Prophet said, \"O the son of Al-Khattab! No doubt, I am Allah's Apostle and Allah will never neglect me.\" So Umar left the place angrily and he was so impatient that he went to Abu Bakr and said, \"O Abu Bakr! Aren't we on the right (path) and they (pagans) on the wrong?\" Abu Bakr said, \"O the son of Al-Khattab! He is Allah's Apostle, and Allah will never neglect him.\" Then Sura Al-Fath (The Victory) was revealed.\"\n\nParagraph 18: In the January 2 Big Ten Conference opener against Minnesota, Michigan won its fifth consecutive game against Minnesota and its fifth consecutive game at the Williams Arena. After winning two games by a combined 50 points last year, Michigan beat Northwestern 74\u201351 to mark its sixth straight victory over the Wildcats. The team gave Nebraska its first loss in the new Pinnacle Bank Arena on January 9, its first five-game win streak since the 2013 NCAA tournament. By beating Penn State on January 14, Michigan won its first four conference games for the first time since the 2002\u201303 team won its first six games. In the game Stauskas had a game-high 21 points, a team-high five assists and six rebounds. On January 18 Michigan defeated (#3 AP, #3 Coaches) Wisconsin at the Kohl Center for the first time since the 1998\u201399 team won on February 27, 1999 against the 1998\u201399 Badgers, ending an 11-game losing streak at Wisconsin. It was the highest-ranked team to lose to Michigan on the road, surpassing a victory over #5 Duke on  December 5, 1964 by the Cazzie Russell-led 1964\u201365 team. After the win, Michigan returned to the national polls (#21, #T25). On January 21 Stauskas was the Big Ten Conference Player of the Week for the first time, leading the conference in scoring and 20-point games. On January 22 Michigan defeated (#10, #10) Iowa, matching the 6\u20130 start of the 2002\u201303 team and the Wolverines' first defeat of consecutive top-10 opponents since the 1996\u201397 team defeated #10 Duke and #6 Arizona. It was the first time Michigan defeated consecutive top-10 opponents in consecutive games since the 1992\u201393 team defeated #5 North Carolina and #2 Kansas in December 1992. Stauskas tied his career high of 26 points, with five rebounds and five assists. On January 25, ESPN's College GameDay covered the Michigan-Michigan State rivalry game. With Michigan State on an 11-game winning streak (including seven in conference) and Michigan on an eight-game winning streak (including six in conference), the game was the first time in Big Ten history that two teams met who were 6\u20130 or better in conference play. Michigan defeated the (#3, #3) Spartans 80\u201375, with Stauskas and Walton contributing 19 points apiece. It was the first time in school history that the team defeated three consecutive AP Poll top-10 opponents, and the first time since the 2006\u201307 Florida Gators that any team\u2014and the first time since the 1986\u201387 Iowa Hawkeyes that a Big Ten team\u2014won three consecutive games against top-10 opponents. It gave the team consecutive road wins against top-five opponents after a 36-game losing streak against them. Michigan's 7\u20130 Big Ten start was its best since the 1976\u201377 Wolverines won their first eight games. Stauskas was the Big Ten and CBS Sports National Player of the Week, and Walton was the Big Ten Freshman of the Week on January 27. Stauskas was also named the Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) on January 28. Michigan extended its winning streak to 10 games, tying its 1976\u201377 8\u20130 Big Ten start by beating Purdue. Caris LeVert had his first double-double, with a career-high 11 rebounds.\n\nParagraph 19: A much rarer but still observed process, according to some linguists, is the formation of mixed languages. Whereas creoles are formed by communities lacking a common language, mixed languages are formed by communities fluent in both languages. They tend to inherit much more of the complexity (grammatical, phonological, etc.) of their parent languages, whereas creoles begin as simple languages and then develop in complexity more independently. It is sometimes explained as bilingual communities that no longer identify with the cultures of either of the languages they speak, and seek to develop their own language as an expression of their own cultural uniqueness.\n\nParagraph 20: Tobrova ts\u00e4sson is a small fir wood cross-beam building that has a square floor plan; it is connected by fishtail tenons in the corner. Corner tenons are axe-hewn; the walls of the building have also been hewn from the inside. Some of the wall beams have been replaced by newer ones: the lower log row in the entire building, two lower beams on the north-east side and two lower beams on the northern corner. The wall beams of the building in the corners and in the middle of the wall are standing on granite stones. The dimensions of the ts\u00e4sson are 508 x 332\u00a0cm; the building has one interior room (12.3 m2) and an outer shelter of 2.3 m2. The entrance-room has square beam posts and a vertical boarding barrier. The supporting posts and barrier of the entrance-room has been replaced a few decades ago; a bit earlier, wider, sawn, vertical boards fixed side-by-side were used at the lower part of the barrier. Back then, the posts were axe-hewn square beams. The ceiling of the ts\u00e4sson is finished by wide boarding, hammered to the rafters and forming a roof-ceiling. There are no ceiling-beams. The building stands on granite stones. The height of the wall from the ground up to where the rafters are attached is 188\u00a0cm and the height up to the ridge is 366\u00a0cm. The photos of 1974 and 1980 show that the building had a shingle roof that was in good condition, and now has eternit sheets on top of it. The ridge has a simple forged cross on it. A faded entry icon is under the eaves. The floor is made from hand hewn and dressed boards. The building has a door (92 x 146\u00a0cm) made from boards fixed on the crosspiece and attached on the hewn tender posts. Forged hinges with tips resembling bird heads are on the door. From the inside, the door does not have a finishing; sheeting with fishtail fluting is hammered on the outside. There is an alms box outside next to the door. The eastern side of the building has a wooden window with a single frame and three panes. The window with a trapdoor opens on the inside. The building has been inventoried during 1974. Fr. Dr. Fr. R. Kreutzwald Memorial Museum expedition. A photo was taken of the ts\u00e4sson and icons and an inventory record was drawn up where the structure of the building and the icons were described. Tobrova ts\u00e4sson is said to be one of the best preserved ts\u00e4sson in Merem\u00e4e rural municipality on the inventory record (Kupp 1974). The outer look of the ts\u00e4sson has not changed much compared to 1974.\n\nParagraph 21: Featuring two BCS top-10 match-ups (No. 3 Oregon at No. 5 Stanford and No. 10 Oklahoma at No. 6 Baylor), the night of November 7 was tabbed by some in the media as the biggest Thursday night in college football history.  The first quarter and a half of the Baylor\u2013Oklahoma ballgame proved to be a low-scoring, defensive struggle.  Baylor won the coin toss and elected to receive; the Bears' first offensive possession ended in a punt.  Baylor's defense subsequently forced a 3-and-out, and Aaron Jones put the Bears ahead with a 29-yard field goal on Baylor's second possession of the game.  The Bears again forced a Sooners 3-and-out on Oklahoma's next possession, but Baylor's ensuing drive was stopped by the Oklahoma defense.  Following a Spencer Roth punt, the Sooners took possession at their own 29 yard line.  Although Oklahoma could not pick up a first down against the Baylor defense, the Sooners nonetheless found themselves with first down and goal from the Baylor 7-yard line following 53 penalty yards against Baylor; 38 of those yards came on a single play in which KJ Morton was flagged for targeting and Ahmad Dixon was hit with two flags for unsportsmanlike conduct.  Baylor's defense subsequently turned in a goal-line stand, resisting two Blake Bell rushes from inside the Bears' 2-yard line.  KJ Morton (whose targeting ejection had been overturned on review) brought Bell down on fourth and goal to force the turnover on downs.  However, after Baylor's offense took possession under the shadow of their own goalposts, the Sooner defense put up Oklahoma's first points of the game two plays later, sacking QB Bryce Petty in the endzone for a safety.  Jalen Saunders returned the ensuing Baylor free kick to the Bears' 12 yard line, but the Baylor defense again stood firm, forcing a 3-and-out and holding the Sooners to a field goal that gave Oklahoma its first lead of the game.  Both teams would end their next possessions with missed field goals before Baylor scored the first touchdown of the night on a 5-yard Bryce Petty rush.  Oklahoma would be forced to punt on their next possession and the ensuing 93-yard Baylor drive would end with a second rushing touchdown from Petty.  On the Sooners' next play from scrimmage, linebacker Eddie Lackey picked off Blake Bell to set up a touchdown pass from Petty to Antwan Goodley with 13 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter.  The teams entered the half with Baylor leading 24\u20135.\n\nParagraph 22: After starting out with the team in the late 1980s as a trainee and having two loan spells away, at Ipswich Town and Oxford United Walker played in the winning 1989\u201390 FA Youth Cup Tottenham team overcoming Middlesbrough. During the early 1990s Walker was mainly used as the reserve keeper, making the odd cup appearance along the way, but after a serious injury to then Spurs keeper Erik Thorstvedt Walker took his chance and soon became the number 1 at Spurs, cementing his place in the side and getting his chance in the team during the first season of the Premiership making a total of 17 appearances in the league. 1992\u201393 season. Walker went on and made a total of 312 appearances for Tottenham Hotspur and played a big part during the 1999 season in helping Spurs win the 1999 Football League Cup Final after beating Leicester City 1\u20130 at Wembley Stadium. During the latter stages of Walkers career at Spurs he fell out of favour with the management and lost his place to the newly signed Neil Sullivan it was shortly after this, that the England international handed in a transfer request in September 2000. He played his final game for Spurs against West Ham United on 31 January 2001.\n\nParagraph 23: Toubou Teda allege and refer to their slaves as Kamadja, their authentic designation deliberately, which is a misinterpretation of Kamaya, who are grudgingly attempting to derogate the Toubou Gourane Kamaya clans' federation because the Kamaya's history was fabricated by the French colonists. In addition, the tone terms, such as Kamadja for the male plural and also it can be used as a general and Kamadji for the male singular, all of these terms can be used, although they have no meaning. The female singular Kamadjedo or Kamadjero is preposterous and nonsensical, while the plural form of the female term, Kamadjeda, has an exceedingly bizarre and illogical tone. The term \"Kamadja\" is somewhat stuck and fading on the ethnic group Kamaya which does not recognize itself in it and it was originated and peddled by the French colonists, however, it is believed to be misquoted, misconstrued, and distorted the letters \"Y\" to \"J\" or \"Dj\" in the identities of a multitude of clans, tribes, communities, rural areas, living creatures, and many more across virtually the entire nation of Chad and also the 1869 writings of Dr. Gustav Nichtigal contain references to various inaccuracies, such as the Yira clan as Jira, the Yenoa clan as Jenoa, the Yin oasis as Jin, and the Yarda oasis as Jarda, the Faya oasis as Faja, the Bidayet community as Bidajet, the Goli Yeskou as Goli Jeskou (Black snake), etc. Dr. G. Nichtigal gathered intelligence for the German government in order to colonize these regions; however, Chad became part of the French empire when they divided the African continent, and thus the French invaders exploited Dr. G. Nichtigal's works in order to invade Chad. In direct relation to the Kamadja term, neither the Tedaga nor the Dazaga languages have the term \"Kamadja\u201d. On the other hand, the significance of the designation Kamaya has value, meaning and history that derived from \"Kama-Dro-Y\u00e9d\u00e9\", which refers to the valley's occupant of the Faya oasis in Kanem Dazaga's dialect, where \"Kama\" signifies valley, \"Dro\" signifies inside, and \"Y\u00e9d\u00e9\" signifies a dweller. \"Y\u00e9\" signifies dwells and \"D\u00e9\" is the signifier of a singular form which \"Kama-Dro-Y\u00e9d\u00e9\" literally states \"who dwells in the valley\" of the palm grove of Faya oasis.  The clans of Kamaya were originally referred to as \"Kamayada\" where \"Ya\" means dwell and \"Da\" is the signifier of the plural form, while \"Kamay\u00e9d\u00e9\" is a singular form that signifies an inhabitant of the valley of Faya palm grove oasis, since the suffix \"D\u00e9\" is added to the singular form of \"Y\u00e9\u201d. Thus, Kamaya means the natives of the valley of the palm grove of Faya oasis. In Dazaga, the community is called \"Kama-Yanga\". Which means the Kamaya canton and the suffix \"Ga\" implies the dialect spoken by the Dazagada. In this language, the nationals of this canton are referred to as \"Kamaye\" (male singular), \"Kamayedo\" or \"Kamayero\" (female singular) and depends on the accents of specific regions and individuals, the suffix may be pronounced differently from \u201cDo\u201d to \u201cRo\u201d, \"Kamayeda\" (female plural), and \"Kamaya\" (male plural and as a general).\n\nParagraph 24: As the commander of the 3rd Division, Brivonesi was the protagonist of the Italian defeat in the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy. On 8 November 1941, Brivonesi sailed from Messina with Trieste, Trento and the 13th Destroyer Flotilla (Granatiere, Bersagliere, Fuciliere, Alpino) as distant escort of the \"Beta\" convoy (later known as the \"Duisburg\" convoy), which consisted in 7 merchant ships (the Italian cargo ships Maria, Sagitta and Rina Corrado, the Italian tankers Conte di Misurata and Minatitlan and the German cargo ships Duisburg and San Marco, laden with 389 vehicles, 34,473 long tons of munitions and mat\u00e9riel and 17,281 long tons of fuel) with a close escort of six destroyers (under the command of Captain Ugo Bisciani on Maestrale). The convoy was spotted by a British reconnaissance plane, and Force K (light cruisers Aurora and Penelope and destroyers Lance and Lively) sailed from Malta to intercept. The attack happened during the following night; Force K took the close escort by surprise, sank one destroyer (Fulmine) and disabled another (Grecale), then proceeded to sink all the seven merchants, while the confused and disarticulated reaction of the other destroyers (left without orders, as Maestrale's radio antenna was shot away) was unable to stop or damage the British ships. Brivonesi's 3rd Division, at the time of the attack (00:57 on 9 November), was sailing at 12 knots about three miles astern and to the east of the convoy. The Division only realized that the convoy was being attacked when they spotted the flash of the British guns; shortly before, at 00:30, Trieste had intercepted a coded message of unknown source and meaning (the source was Force K), and Brivonesi was about to send a general alert to all his ships, when the battle started. Trieste and Trento opened fire on Force K at 1:03, from a distance of 9,000-10,000 meters; Brivonesi's subsequent manoeuvre later drew heavy criticism: instead of turning southeast, where Force K was, to close in on the British ships and attack them at once, he turned starboard so that his cruisers could bring all guns to bear, which required several minutes. Brivonesi's ships briefly assumed a southerly course (thus distancing themselves from Force K even more), then turned to port and then to starboard, advancing at a speed of only 15-16 knots, less than half the speed that they could keep. Force K kept manoeuvring around the convoy so that the latter was constantly between the British ships and the Italian Division, which caused the blazing merchants and their smoke to hamper the aim of the Italian gunners. At 1:12 Brivonesi ordered to increase speed to 18 knots and at 1:25 to 24 knots, but by then the distance had risen to 17,000 meters, and he ordered to cease fire, as it was pointless. At 1:29 Brivonesi ordered to turn north, in order to intercept the Force K when the latter would turn back towards Malta (by then the convoy was completely destroyed). Meanwhile, however, Supermarina (the Italian Navy high command) had informed him that the risk of a torpedo bomber attack on his ships was high; as they were outside of Malta's aircraft's reach, Brivonesi believed that a British aircraft carrier was in the area. Upon realizing that the fires of the disabled merchant ships lighted up his ships, making them easier targets for submarines as well as aircraft, Brivonesi ordered to cease fire, leave the area and assume a northwesterly course, at 1:32. Overall, Trieste and Trento had fired 207 8-inch shells, without scoring any hits. The 3rd Division only returned to the area after a few hours, to cover the search and rescue operation, during which the destroyer Libeccio was sunk by HMS Upholder and Trento was narrowly missed by a torpedo.\n\nParagraph 25: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty, in action on the western ridge of Mount Altuzzo, Italy. After bitter fighting his company had advanced to within 50 yards of the objective, where it was held up due to intense enemy sniper, automatic, small arms, and mortar fire. The enemy launched 3 desperate counterattacks in an effort to regain their former positions, but all 3 were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides. All officers and noncommissioned officers of the 2d and 3d platoons of Company B had become casualties, and S/Sgt. Keathley, guide of the 1st platoon, moved up and assumed command of both the 2d and 3d platoons, reduced to 20 men. The remnants of the 2 platoons were dangerously low on ammunition, so S/Sgt. Keathley, under deadly small arms and mortar fire, crawled from 1 casualty to another, collecting their ammunition and administering first aid. He then visited each man of his 2 platoons, issuing the precious ammunition he had collected from the dead and wounded, and giving them words of encouragement. The enemy now delivered their fourth counterattack, which was approximately 2 companies in strength. In a furious charge they attacked from the front and both flanks, throwing hand grenades, firing automatic weapons, and assisted by a terrific mortar barrage. So strong was the enemy counterattack that the company was given up for lost. The remnants of the 2d and 3d platoons of Company B were now looking to S/Sgt. Keathley for leadership. He shouted his orders precisely and with determination and the men responded with all that was in them. Time after time the enemy tried to drive a wedge into S/Sgt. Keathley's position and each time they were driven back, suffering huge casualties. Suddenly an enemy hand grenade hit and exploded near S/Sgt. Keathley, inflicting a mortal wound in his left side. However, hurling defiance at the enemy, he rose to his feet. Taking his left hand away from his wound and using it to steady his rifle, he fired and killed an attacking enemy soldier, and continued shouting orders to his men. His heroic and intrepid action so inspired his men that they fought with incomparable determination and viciousness. For 15 minutes S/Sgt. Keathley continued leading his men and effectively firing his rifle. He could have sought a sheltered spot and perhaps saved his life, but instead he elected to set an example for his men and make every possible effort to hold his position. Finally, friendly artillery fire helped to force the enemy to withdraw, leaving behind many of their number either dead or seriously wounded. S/Sgt. Keathley died a few moments later. Had it not been for his indomitable courage and incomparable heroism, the remnants of 3 rifle platoons of Company B might well have been annihilated by the overwhelming enemy attacking force. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.\n\nParagraph 26: Ten years after Jenny's death, Bette is running for Mayor of Los Angeles. It is revealed that during the last ten years, Bette and Tina did get married, but also got divorced after Tina left Bette for another woman, Carrie, with Bette getting at least partial custody of Angelica, who now lives with her. Bette refuses campaign funding from Dani N\u00f9\u00f1ez, a PR executive for her father's company which invests in opioids, but Dani has a change of heart and resigns in order to work for Bette. Also seeking to sabotage Bette's campaign is Tyler Adams, as Bette once slept with his closeted lesbian ex-wife, Felicity. In response, Bette goes on Alice's new television show to tell her side of the story and arranges an interview with Felicity, with whom she renews her affair. On Dani's advice, Bette breaks up with Felicity to avoid further controversy, and in retaliation, Felicity tips Tyler and the press off about their renewed affair, putting her campaign in jeopardy once again when Tyler confronts her and Bette is forced to punch him to protect Angelica. Bette finally reveals to the press that her reason for running for mayor is that Kit died of an opioid overdose, and enrolls Angelica in a public school when she is suspended by her racist and homophobic private school for physically defending Bette against a classmate, winning her a grant from the teachers' union. At the same time, Tina visits Bette and Angelica to offer her support. Despite their troubled past, Bette hopes to renew her relationship with Tina, but Tina privately reveals to Bette that she is marrying Carrie and they moving to Los Angeles so that they can be closer to Angelica. Ultimately, Bette loses the election to her far-right conservative rival, Jeff Milner, who had aired several campaign commercials which denounced Bette's moral values. Bette goes to grieve for Kit with Angelica where her ashes were scattered. In the process, she runs into Maya, a lesbian reporter who was covering her campaign, and accepts a dinner invitation from her.\n\nParagraph 27: Less than a month after American Idol'''s first season finale, Day reunited with the top thirty contestants to perform in the two-hour American Idol in Las Vegas TV special. Day then participated through October and November in the 2002 American Idols LIVE! tour, along with his fellow top ten finalists. Each of this tour's thirty shows was opened by Day singing Janet Jackson's \"Black Cat\". To usher in 2003, Day performed in Pasadena, California's New Year's Day Rose Parade. Paired with eighth place finalist AJ Gil on a float for Give Kids the World, the two sang \"Calling All Angels\", a song which had been specifically written for the charity organization. The band OTown also participated in this float. Day and Gil would subsequently perform \"Calling All Angels\" at an Orlando, Florida fundraising gala in June and release this duet as a single through Give Kids the World. Later that year, Day participated in further fundraising events, such as the Hollywood Knights Season Wrap Party in Los Angeles and NSYNC's Challenge for the Children event in Miami. Throughout the Spring, Day participated in Coca-Cola's Behind the Scenes With American Idol promotional tour, in which he and a selection of other finalists from the first two seasons of the series performed in shopping malls owned by the Simon Property Group.   Around this time, Day also performed the National Anthem for a variety of professional Georgia sports teams, such as the Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta Thrashers. In November, Day performed along with Edwin McCain and American Idol second season finalist Vanessa Olivarez in a tree lighting ceremony at the World of Coca-Cola.\n\nParagraph 28: Ali was one of several men hired by the United States Army to introduce camels as beasts of burden to transport cargo across the \"Great American Desert.\" Eight of the men \u2013 including Ali \u2013 were of Greek origin. They arrived at the Port of Indianola in Calhoun County, Texas on the . The book Go West Greek George by Steven Dean Pastis, published in both Greek and English, specifically identifies all eight men. These pioneers were Yiorgos Caralambo (later known as Greek George), Hadji Ali (Hi Jolly, a.k.a. Philip Tedro), Mimico Teodora (Mico), Hadjiatis Yannaco (Long Tom), Anastasio Coralli (Short Tom), Michelo Georgios, Yanni Iliato, and Giorgios Costi. The Americans acquired three camels in Tunis, nine in Egypt, and 21 in Smyrna: 33 in all. Ali was the lead camel driver during the US Army's experiment with the U.S. Camel Corps in using camels in the dry deserts of the Southwest. After successfully traveling round trip from Texas to California, the experiment failed, partly due to the problem that the Army's burros, horses, and mules feared the large animals, often panicking, and the tensions of the American Civil War led to Congress not approving more funds for the Corps. In 1864, the camels were finally auctioned off in Benicia, California, and Camp Verde, Texas. Ali was discharged from the Quartermaster Department of the U.S. Army at Fort McDowell in 1870.\n\nParagraph 29: A school teacher begins a musical lesson to a classroom of children with recorders. One child asks if it is \"Three Blind Mice\" while the teacher says \"Hot Cross Buns\". As they play, the children's eyes glow and \"x\"'s appear on their forehead. Ten years later, he sits on a couch with his wife Kim, a Korean policewoman. He remarks his marriage has put \"Hot Cross Buns\" behind him which confuses Kim. A melody starts from another room and he asks about it. Kim says she found a box of recorders in the attic and their daughter Christine is practicing \"Three Blind Mice\". He says it is not \"Three Blind Mice\" but \"Hot Cross Buns\". Both parents go to Christine's bedroom to find she is playing the song. He tries to dissuade her from playing \"Hot Cross Buns\" with \"Three Blind Mice\". However, Christine continues with the same song and her eyes glow and a \"x\" appears on her forehead. He explains it is a mark for an otherworldly monster \"Hot Cross Buns\" who will claim their daughter as its own. He explains that this was his life when Kim says this is illegal. Despite this, he pulls out a recorder and plays the song causing him to disappear into another reality. In front of a castle, he asks the guard to see the three blind mice inside. The guard declines his request yet he persists. As things ensue, he recalls Kim's plea to abstain from illegalism. Regardless, he chokes the guard. After, he confronts the three blind mice who implore him to confront the beast with a pure heart. Instead, he requests magic from them. The mice reply magic of a pure heart is all that is needed when he sees their magic sceptre. Distracting the blind mice, he then steals it which cause them to die. Atop the castle, he uses the sceptre to summon the beast. Hot Cross Buns says the magic sceptre cannot kill him due to the ways of the three blind mice. The beast also invades his mind. The memory of Kim arrests him for illegal mind invasion. Distracting Hot Cross Buns, he then kills the beast. Returning to his home, he finds his daughter dead and Kim explains the circumstance. In a flashback, Hot Cross Buns says his life was linked with Christine. Nevertheless, he proceeds to sing the song one last time.\n\nParagraph 30: Laneco was founded by Raymond A. Bartolacci Sr. in 1946. The first store opened as Paramount Foods in Easton, Pennsylvania, and completed its first day of business with a total of less than $20 in sales. The stores were acquired by Supervalu in October 1992, and were closed by them in 2001. The stores were scaled down for the last several years until they were closed. The stores operated with a union and several thousand employees were laid off at the closure of the stores. Laneco had around 16 stores at the time of closure. Many stores were purchased by and converted to Giant such as the Lehighton, PA location, while Redner's picked up a few locations, Country Junction took over the Wind Gap store, Ahart's Market operated a few locations such as the former Food Lanes in Allentown and Bethlehem PA and Phillipsburg, NJ (all of which have since closed). The Clinton and the Whitehouse (now closed) SuperCenters in New Jersey are now Wal-Mart stores and the Laneco in Phillipsburg was demolished, with a Wal-Mart, a White Castle, a Wawa, and a Quaker Steak & Lube which got replaced by Stone Tavern now occupying the redeveloped site. The Hometown, PA Laneco would become a TJ Bart's location before eventually closing and the lot being used to build a Wal-Mart.

It is the first true sequel to Dragon's Lair. As with the original, Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp consists of an animated short film that requires the player to move the joystick or press a fire button at certain times in order to continue. It takes place years after the original Dragon's Lair. Dirk has married Daphne, and the marriage has produced many children. When Daphne is kidnapped by the evil wizard Mordroc in order to be forced into marriage, Dirk's children and his mother-in-law are clearly upset by the abduction of Daphne, and Dirk must once again save her.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1914, he moved to Krak\u00f3w and joined the First Cadre Company, which fought on the Austro-Hungarian side against Russia. In October 1914 he became a commander of a platoon of a squadron in . During the fighting in 1914\u20131915, he was promoted to lieutenant, and after the war he was awarded the V-Class Virtuti Militari. In August 1915, he moved to the special group in Warsaw. Soon he became an aide-de-camp to J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. In 1918, he was sent on a mission to Russia. He was given three tasks: persuade General J\u00f3zef Haller's army, then in the Ukraine, to back Pi\u0142sudski (he failed in this task); reach the French military mission in Moscow under General Lavergne (he succeeded in this task); and return from Moscow to Paris to liaise with the government there. Unfortunately, he was arrested by the Soviet Cheka as a member of the Polish Military Organisation while on a French diplomatic train on its way from Moscow to Murmansk (and Paris). He was imprisoned in the Taganka prison. He was freed thanks to the intervention of his future wife, Bronis\u0142awa Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowska, with the much-feared Cheka operative Yakovleva, then in charge of the prison. Bronis\u0142awa, n\u00e9e Kliatchkin, was at that time married to the lawyer , the lawyer of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the head of the Cheka. She was a Lutheran, her family having converted from the Jewish faith when she was eight. He married her in a Lutheran ceremony on 2 October 1919 at Lutheran zb\u00f3r in Nowy Gaw\u0142\u00f3w. The marriage register records the details from her false French passport, including \"Lalande\" as her maiden name.\n\nParagraph 3: After the battle of Stamford Bridge and the death of Harald Hardrada, Skule and Ketel, the two sons of Tostig Godwinson, were taken to Norway under the wing of Hardrada's son Olaf.  Olaf, who became king of Norway, gave land to Ketel and arranged a good marriage for him; according to the 13th-century saga-writer Snorri Sturluson, \"from him are descended many great people\".  Skule became known as Skule Kongsfostre (king's foster-son), and was remembered as a remarkably intelligent and handsome man who commanded the king's hird.  He married a relative of the king, Gudrun Nevsteinsdotter, and their son was \u00c5solv of Rein (in Rissa), father of the lendmann Guttorm of Rein.  Guttorm's son, B\u00e5rd Guttormsson of Rein, was a close friend and supporter of king Sverre Sigurdsson, fought alongside him in several battles, and was rewarded by being given the king's half-sister, Cecilia Sigurdsdotter, in marriage.  B\u00e5rd and Cecilia's son Inge B\u00e5rdsson was born about the year 1185.  In 1204, when the child-king Guttorm Sigurdsson died, the two obvious candidates for the crown were Inge and his half-brother Haakon Galen, Cecilia's son by another husband.  After a struggle for power Inge was recognized as king, while Haakon retained his former command of the army.  This did not produce peace, for a faction known as the Bagler succeeded in splitting the kingdom, with Inge ruling the western half and their own candidate, Philip Simonsson, the eastern half.  Moreover, earl Haakon renewed his own claim to the crown, a claim which only lapsed with his death in 1214.  King Inge himself died in 1217.  Since 1213 the leader of the army and the hird had been Inge's half-brother Skule, a son of B\u00e5rd Guttormsson by another wife, Ragnfrid Erlingsdotter, and therefore, like king Inge, fifth in descent in the male line from Tostig Godwinson.  The new king, Haakon IV, was no more than a boy, with Skule acting as his regent.  In 1225 Skule married his young daughter, Margrete, to the king, but this did not succeed in establishing perfect amity between the two men, and in 1239 Skule went into open rebellion, claiming the title of king for himself.  The subsequent war went against him, and he was killed in 1240.  From Haakon IV and Margrete Skulesdotter descend subsequent kings of Norway down to the present day.\n\nParagraph 4: The Israel Police is responsible for investigations and arrests regarding civilian crimes. If the Israel Police learns of a possible criminal offense through a complaint by a private citizen or through other evidence, it then decides whether or not to open an investigation. In the case of an offense other than a felony, a police officer with the rank of captain or higher is entitled to order that no investigation take place if the officer is of the opinion that no public interest is involved or another authority is legally competent to carry out the investigation. During a police investigation, a judge must issue a search warrant for police to search a home or review computer material, though a police officer may search a home without a warrant if there are reasonable grounds to assume a felony is being committed there or was recently committed there. Any search either with or without a warrant must be conducted in the presence of two witnesses who are not police officers unless the circumstances and urgency of the case do not allow it, a judge permitted it, or the owner of the property or one of the household members requested that it not be conducted in the presence of witnesses. If the police wish to arrest a suspect following an investigation, an arrest warrant must be obtained from a judge. The police must present evidence to the judge, who will issue a warrant only if satisfied that there is reasonable suspicion that the person committed an offense. A police officer is entitled to carry out an arrest without a warrant if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the suspect committed an offense and if one of the following conditions are met: the suspected offense was committed in the officer's presence or in the recent past, there is a reasonable suspicion that the suspect will not appear for investigative procedures, there is reasonable suspicion that the suspect will disrupt trial proceedings, there is reasonable suspicion that the suspect's continued freedom will constitute a danger to the public, committed a select number of serious violent crimes, drug crimes, or security crimes, or there are reasonable grounds to suspect a suspect violated bail or escaped lawful custody.\n\nParagraph 5: Nicholas's son Charles (1662\u20131740), the 4th earl, had not been summoned to parliament when in 1692 he killed his brother-in-law, Captain Philip Lawson, in a duel. This raised the question of his rank in a new form. Was he, or was he not, entitled to trial by the peers? The House of Lords declared that he was not a peer and therefore not so entitled, but the Court of King's Bench released him from his imprisonment on the ground that he was the Earl of Banbury and not Charles Knowles, a commoner. Nevertheless, the House of Lords refused to move from its position, and Knowles had not received a writ of summons when he died in April 1740. He seems to have been the classic Restoration rake, dissolute and riotous. He dissipated an estate of \u00a320,000 a year and appears to have had so loose a grasp of the concept of marriage that the word bigamous did not even begin to describe his conjugal exploits. He was legitimately married twice and left children, all of whom were baptised Knowles, and whose descendants are alive today. His son Charles (1703\u20131771), vicar of Burford, Oxfordshire, and his grandsons, Sir William (1726\u20131776) and Sir Thomas Woods (1727\u20131793), were successively titular Earls of Banbury, but they took no steps to prove their title. His natural son Admiral Sir Charles Knowles Bt ( 1704\u20131777) rose to become Rear Admiral of Great Britain and was created a baronet in 1765 of Lovell Hill, and from whom descends the present holder of the baronetcy. The Naval Chronicle of 1799 stated that \u201c\u2026he was the natural son of an earl of Bambury\u2026.and a French gentlewoman of rank and uncommon beauty, whom he seduced: circumstances made her case to be pitied and she was much noted by Lord and Lady Wallingford.\u201d\n\nParagraph 6: Raja next began work on the family drama film Santosh Subramaniam (2008), a remake of the Telugu film Bommarillu (2006), after outbidding several other interested parties for the remake rights. The film's original version was made by Raja's friend, Bhaskar, who also stated that Raja would be the most apt director to remake the film into the Tamil language. Ravi and Prakash Raj were chosen again to play lead roles, while Genelia D'Souza was selected as the film's heroine, after winning acclaim for her portrayal of the role in the original version. The film revolved around a father and son relationship; where the son's choices and his ambitions to achieve something in life are subdued by his father, and Raja related the storyline back to his personal life. Santosh Subramaniam opened to positive reviews from critics, with Raja winning critical acclaim for his work. A critic from Sify.com noted \"Raja, a past master at remakes, is once again a winner\" and that the film \"has simple charm, immensely likeable characters, and the intrinsic humour in the writing makes it a must watch\". Similarly, a critic from The Hindu noted \"for the fourth time in succession film-maker Raja shows he can re-make a film to suit the audiences here\", stating the script was \"aptly re-tuned to suit the Tamil milieu\". The film also went on to be ranked amongst the Best Tamil films of the year by the Tamil Nadu State, while it also garnered four Filmfare Award nominations, including one for Best Film. Moreover, it became a very profitable venture for the makers, running for over 100 days in theatres across Tamil Nadu. The producers, AGS Entertainment, subsequently requested Raja to make another film with Ravi after Santosh Subramaniam'''s success, but Raja gave Ravi's dates to director Prabhu Deva to film Engeyum Kaadhal (2011).\n\nParagraph 7: Led by Usma bin Luai, the Tayy invaded the mountains of Ajaa and Salma from Banu Assad and Banu Tamim in northern Arabia in their exodus from Yemen in 115 CE. These mountains were renamed to Jabal Tayy (Tayy's Mountain), and then again in the 14th century, after the tribe changed their name, to Jabal Shammar. There, Tayy, later Shammar, became either city-dwellers in the city of Ha'il, nomadic pastoralists, camel-herders and horse-breeders in northern Najd, or agriculturists in the countryside outside Ha'il or in the surrounding desert oases. These divisions were based on profession, personal interest and skill, and not family or blood-line stratifications within the tribe. It is common for the same nuclear family to have members living each of the three different lifestyles. Because of their strength and blood relations with the Yemenite dynasties that came to rule Syria (Ghassanids) and Iraq (Muntherids), the Tayy expanded north into Iraq all the way to al-Hira, the capital at the time. Oral tradition mentions that the first chiefs of the Shammar tribe, Arar and Omair, were of the 'Abda family of Dhaigham, who ruled Shammar from Jabal Shammar. In the 17th century, a large section of the Shammar left Jabal Shammar under the leadership of the Al Jarba and settled in Iraq, reaching as far as the northern city of Mosul, their current stronghold. The Shammar are currently one of Iraq's largest tribes and are divided into two geographical, as opposed to genealogical, subsections. The northern branch, known as Shammar al-Jarba, is mainly Sunni, while the southern branch, Shammar Toga, converted to Shia Islam around the 19th century after settling in southern Iraq.\n\nParagraph 8: Between 1255 and 1256 the people of lower Gwynedd were chafing under the heavy tax burden imposed by Geoffrey of Langley, a royal favorite and lieutenant in the region who sought to extend the English shire system there. Prince Edward made a tour of his holdings of Chester as its earl, and then progressed into the Perfeddwlad to inspect his castles of Diserth and Deganwy. After Edward's departure, when it became clear to the Welsh of the region that the English prince was not inclined to intervene on their behalf over Langley's 'tyrannous exactions,\u2019 they rose in revolt and appealed to Llywelyn II for aid. Furthermore, Prince Edward appointed Patrick Chaworth as Steward of Carmarthen, an appointment that \"could hardly be tolerated by Llywelyn who was already bitter and resentful\" over the conditions in lower Gwynedd, whose people appealed for his deliverance. Having reconciled with Dafydd, Llywelyn II released his brother who he thought would be a valuable lieutenant, then gathered an army and crossed the river Conwy. Within one week Llywelyn II swept eastwards almost as far as Chester itself, stretching Gwynedd's princely domain \"to its old bounds,\" wrote Lloyd. Only the castles at Deganwy and Diserth were left as islets under siege in what was now \"purely Welsh country\" again. Prince Edward and his lieutenant Geoffrey of Langley, who had been in England during the week of Llywelyn's campaign, were powerless to respond as they, and the English crown, lacked any treasury for retaliatory measures against the Welsh prince. And the English crown was abandoned by yet another ally against Llywelyn, the Marcher lords, who \"sympathized with the insurgents as victims of a common tyranny, and the very barons of the March, hereditary foes of the Welsh, viewed their rebellion with toleration, if not actual friendliness,\" wrote Lloyd. The Marcher lords were suspicious of growing royal authority over the March since the Peace of Woodstock. The inability of the crown to launch any response and the ambivilance so far expressed by other Marcher lords emboldened Llywelyn towards further campaigns. First, he recovered Meirionydd, recovered for Gwynedd the royal holdings of Lanbadarn and Builth, then took Gwerthrynion from his cousin Roger II Mortimer. In South and West Wales, Llywelyn ejected Rhys Fychan from the Ystrad Tywi region and restored Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg to both Cantref Mawr and Cantref Bychan. Llywelyn held his 1256 Christmas court at Aber, one which was \"certainly not wanting in elements of festivity,\" wrote Lloyd. In January 1257 Llywelyn harassed Powys Fadog, already ravaged from the prior year's campaigns, and then conquered Powys Wynwynwyn as far as Pool, driving out Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn. Pushing into Glamorgan, Llywelyn campaigned between the rivers Towy and Tawe where he enlisted the Welsh of the Gower, Kidwelly, and Carnwyllion to his side, thereby undermining the Marcher authority of the barons Patrick Chaworth and William de Braose. A hapless King Henry III sought the aid of his brother Richard, who had just been elected as Holy Roman Emperor, but though Llywelyn II and the emperor exchanged courteous and amicable correspondence, Llywelyn II refused to yield any of his conquests, but agreed to a long truce, one which allow Llywelyn to consolidate his gains. Before Easter 1257, Llywelyn was home in Gwynedd.\n\nParagraph 9: In 2010 Quackenbush became embroiled in a feud with Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (BDK), who had formed on the final show of 2009 and were threatening to take over Chikara, with its members quickly winning the Young Lions Cup, Campeonatos de Parejas and King of Trios, while also having one of its members as the Chikara Director of Fun. After UltraMantis Black declared that rudos and tecnicos would have to come together in order to stop BDK, Quackenbush announced on August 11 that he would join his seven man team facing BDK in the annual torneo cibernetico match on October 23. After defeating The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) and BDK members Lince Dorado and Pinkie Sanchez, Quackenbush and Jigsaw were looking to get a shot at BDK's Claudio Castagnoli and Ares and their Campeonatos de Parejas. However, on August 27 Quackenbush and Jigsaw failed in their attempt at getting a third point by losing to BDK members Daizee Haze and Sara Del Rey, after some shady officiating from the stable's own referee Derek Sabato. The following day Quackenbush and Jigsaw restarted their march towards three points by defeating the House of Truth (Josh Raymond and Christian Abel). On September 18 they picked up their second point by defeating BDK's Lince Dorado and Tim Donst. On October 23 Quackenbush represented Chikara in the torneo cibernetico match, where the company's originals faced BDK. He managed to eliminate Tim Donst from the match after countering his Inverted Chikara Special into the original Chikara Special, but was immediately afterwards eliminated himself by BDK's Claudio Castagnoli. The following day Quackenbush and Jigsaw once again failed in their attempt at getting their third point in a match against BDK members Pinkie Sanchez and Tursas. This failure led to Quackenbush's and Jigsaw's former partner Stigma reminding them that he and Quackenbush still had the three points they had earned two and a half years earlier, but Quackenbush made it clear that he wanted to win the Campeonatos de Parejas with Jigsaw, not Stigma. On November 22 Quackenbush and Jigsaw competed in a four\u2013way elimination match with Sara Del Rey and Daizee Haze, The Osirian Portal and F.I.S.T. (Icarus and Chuck Taylor) and after eliminating all three teams, finally earned the three points needed in order to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas. On December 12, 2010, at the season nine finale Reality is Relative Quackenbush and Jigsaw cashed in their points and defeated Ares and Castagnoli two falls to one to win the Campeonatos de Parejas for the first time. Quackenbush and Jigsaw made their first successful defense of the title on February 19, 2011, defeating The Batiri (Obariyon and Kodama). For the 2011 King of Trios, Quackenbush and Jigsaw formed a trio with Japanese joshi legend Manami Toyota, who had made her Chikara debut alongside Quackenbush the previous September, and on April 15 defeated Amazing Red, Joel Maximo and Wil Maximo in their first round match. The following day, the trio was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinal stage by Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki). On September 18, Quackenbush and Jigsaw lost the Campeonatos de Parejas to F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano) in their third defense. From May to October 2011, Quackenbush took part in 12 Large: Summit, a tournament used to determine the first ever Chikara Grand Champion. Quackenbush ended up winning his block of the tournament with a record of four wins and one loss to set up a final match with the winner of the other block, Eddie Kingston. On November 13 at Chikara's first internet pay-per-view, High Noon, Quackenbush was defeated by Kingston in a match to determine the first Chikara Grand Champion.\n\nParagraph 10: The National Research Programmes (NRP) and National Centres of Competence in Research (NCCR) are the most important research programmes of the SNSF. Mandated by the Federal Council, NRPs generate scientific knowledge aimed at solving pressing problems. They generally run for up to five years and have an overall budget of eight to twelve million Swiss francs. Since 1975, the SNSF has launched over 69 NRPs. NCCRs aim to strengthen research structures in Switzerland. Each NCCR is based at an institution of higher education and consists of a centre of competence as well as a national and international network. NCCRs benefit from SNSF funding of 20 to 60 million Swiss francs over a period of ten to twelve years, as well as university and third party funding.\n\nParagraph 11: Kagami\u014d was the first wrestler from Kagamiyama stable to make the top division since his coach took control of it seventeen years previously. At the time he was also the second longest to reach makuuchi among foreign born wrestlers, at 62 tournament from his professional debut. In an interview about his promotion, talking about his lengthy rise, he happily joked, \"for me it felt quite quick, I thought it was going to take me 15 years.\" During the interview he also announced his engagement to his Mongolian girlfriend. However, his makuuchi performance was lackluster. In one of his relegation trips back to j\u016bry\u014d in May 2015, he was involved in yet another championship playoff round. In it, he won a preliminary playoff bout against Mongolian Seir\u014d only to lose the following final playoff bout to another Mongolian, the up and comer and future sekiwake Ichinoj\u014d, who he had previously defeated on the 9th day of the tournament. Despite his championship playoff loss, his regular tournament record of 11\u20134 at the rank of j\u016bry\u014d 1 was still enough for him to achieve makuuchi re-promotion for the July 2014 tournament, though two consecutive losing tournaments would put him right back in j\u016bry\u014d In this, his third relegation to j\u016bry\u014d, in March 2015, he only managed a 4\u201311 at j\u016bry\u014d 1. However, in the following May tournament, at j\u016bry\u014d 9 he posted an impressive 12\u20133 record, beating Hidenoumi on the last day to avoid a playoff, and finally taking the championship on his third chance. His record and championship earned him his fourth promotion to the top division for the July tournament in Nagoya. There he finally achieved a majority of wins or kachi-koshi in the top division, but he only managed four wins in the following tournament in September 2015 and was demoted back to j\u016bry\u014d for the fourth time. In May 2016 he was injured in a match with Tenkaih\u014d and had to withdraw from the tournament, falling to makushita as a result. In September 2017 he won the makushita division championship with a perfect 7\u20130 record. Following more injury problems he fell to the sandanme division in July 2018, but he won the championship there with an undefeated 7\u20130 score. In October it was announced that he was changing his shikona given name from Nanji to Hideoki. Continuing injury problems saw him pull out of five successive tournaments between July 2020 and March 2021 and fall from makushita to the jonidan division. He transferred to the Isenoumi stable following Kagamiyama stable's closure after the July 2021 tournament, but his continued absence from competition meant he fell off the banzuke completely in September 2021.\n\nParagraph 12: A British colonel, retired from MI5, though sometimes still active for the British government, Clifton functions as an amateur sleuth, and his phlegmatic approach to stress leads to humorous situations. Harold Clifton lives in Puddington, near London, supported by housekeeper Miss Partridge, who makes a prize-winning goulash. Clifton drives a red MG TD from the early fifties, which gets mangled in most stories, but is repaired regardless of cost. Clifton's hobbies include Boy Scouting (he's Boy Scoutmaster Singing Heron), cats, and collecting cigar wraps. In Pass\u00e9 Compos\u00e9 it was established that Clifton served in the RAF as a group captain during World War II before joining the Secret Service. He also ascended to knighthood in the issue Mortelle Saison for saving a member of the Royal family.\n\nParagraph 13: Three spot gourami are native to standing or slow-moving freshwater habitats in southeastern Asia, ranging from Yunnan (China), through mainland southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) to Indonesia (Java, Borneo and Sumatra). They have been widely introduced outside their native range, such as the Philippines, India, Sulawesi, and southwestern Trinidad. These fish live in marshes, swamps, canals, and lowland wetlands. They migrate during the flood season from permanent water bodies to flooded areas, such as seasonally flooded forests in the middle and lower Mekong. During the dry season, they return to these permanent water bodies. These fish feed on zooplankton, crustaceans, and insect larvae. The male builds a bubble nest for the eggs, which he protects aggressively.\n\nParagraph 14: In 1956 Gamal Abdel Nasser, the president of Egypt at the time, chose him to be the only Coptic Christian Minister (Secretary) of supply and trade in the Egyptian cabinet. He held this post for 14 years. He was also the Deputy Prime Minister for the last 6 years of his appointment. During his career, he developed several systems to help the Egyptian poor. He launched a program to sell food staples to the public at subsidized prices through government-owned stores. These stores are still in operation as of 2020. He also developed a system to offer food  ration cards to the poor to insure that they had enough sustenance.\n\nParagraph 15: The Hormones were a rock band formed in London in 1996. Carroll was the sole songwriter for the group, whose sound was described as a mixture between Teenage Fanclub and Stiff Little Fingers. Carroll was the founding member and songwriter for the band who released their debut single in 1996 as part of the Trade2/Island records singles club. The band members were Jez Housden on Bass and former Guns n' Wankers and Wildhearts drummer, Pat Walters. The group eventually signed to Richard Branson's V2 label and released 5 singles. The third single \"Mr. Wilson\" was Carroll's tribute to Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, the lyrics almost entirely consisting of Beach Boys song titles. Brian Wilson heard the track and Carroll was invited to the legendary songwriter's birthday show at New York City's Beacon Theatre in 1999. An album, Where Old Ghosts Meet (a reference from On Raglan Road by Patrick Kavanagh) was released in 1998 but deleted the same week. It has been listed in a book 101 Irish Records You Need to Hear Before You Die. The band featured in the wedding episode of US TV show Friends. A track written by Carroll and originally issued as a B-side, \"Tired Old Souls\", was featured in the program. The band toured consistently throughout the UK and Europe. Carroll also performed with the Scottish Poet/Songwriter Eric Bogle at the Weavers Club in London in 1996. The band opened for The Cranberries on a European tour in 1999. A 2CD edition of the album was issued in Japan on the Excellent label in 2002 in a limited run of 1000 copies. The bonus disc featured B-sides and unreleased material. A second pressing of the vinyl edition was issued on the Velvet label in Japan in a pressing of 500 copies. The band split in 1999 after a show in Madrid, Spain and the recorded output remains out of print. A multi disc (6CD) bootleg set, \"On A Quiet Street \u2013 The Complete Where Old Ghosts Meet Sessions\" was released on the Last Waltz label in Japan in 2003. It included demos, outtakes, alternate mixes, radio sessions and unreleased material. Carroll has never performed any of these songs live since 1999. The Hormones released 5 singles from the Where Old Ghosts Meet album, with each single featuring 3 exclusive non album B-sides which added up to 15 extra songs that were not included on the original album.\n\nParagraph 16: Zara awakens to find her family close by but without the ability to speak or move. Initially, the doctors explain that it might be due to her spinal injuries. Later on, doctors say that she has gone into shock and does not have the will to live; there is nothing wrong physically with her. It is implied to the viewer that she has lost the will to struggle as she realizes that she has pushed everyone away from her in pursuit of what she thought was important and was all alone when what should have been her biggest triumph of finally buying the parents' house back. Saad, her fianc\u00e9, prefers to have a very strong, smart and pretty wife to project success in life. Saad becomes unsure about Zara after her accident as the doctors are skeptical about her recovery. Zara notices that Saad has lost interest in her and decides to return the engagement ring, which she eventually throws away in the garbage. Saad leaves Pakistan and travels abroad. Zara's family try to reassure her regarding the love and affection they have for her. During this time, Zain is shown to be very concerned for Zara's well-being. The closeness between Zara and Zain disturbs Vida (his fianc\u00e9e); Zain's father senses this and insists that Zain marries Vida as he had promised her parents a long time back. Zain agrees to his father's wishes. Zain then meets Zara and tells her that he has to leave Pakistan and go to Canada after marrying Vida, and he wants to see Zara up and about before that. Upon hearing this, Zara takes hesitant steps and is able to walk. An overjoyed Zain recounts this to Vida, who comments that he must be the happiest man on earth. She tells him that she is happy for him and urges him to see clearly as he is madly in love with Zara. She tells him that she has explained the whole situation to Zain's father and would be flying off to Canada alone.\n\nParagraph 17: However, continuing legal complications in the Welles estate and a lawsuit by Welles' daughter, Beatrice Welles, caused the project to be suspended. When Welles died in 1985 he had left many of his assets to his estranged widow Paola Mori, and after her own death in 1986, these were inherited by their daughter, Beatrice Welles. However, he had also left various other assets, from his house in Los Angeles to the full ownership and artistic control of all his unfinished film projects, to his long-time companion, mistress and collaborator Oja Kodar, who co-wrote and co-starred in The Other Side of the Wind. Since 1992, Beatrice Welles has claimed in various courts that under California law, she had ownership of all of Orson Welles' completed and incomplete pictures (including those which he did not own the rights of himself in his own life), and The Other Side of the Wind has been heavily affected by this litigation. The Guardian described how she \"stifled an attempt by US cable company Showtime and Oja Kodar (Welles's partner in the latter part of his life) to complete The Other Side of the Wind\", while The Daily Telegraph stated that Beatrice Welles had \"blocked\" the film. Matters have been exacerbated by much personal animosity between Oja Kodar and Beatrice Welles \u2013 Beatrice blames Kodar for causing the break-up of her parents' marriage, while Kodar blames Beatrice for attempting to block the screening or re-release of a number of her father's works, including Citizen Kane, Othello, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight and Filming Othello. (The latter claim has been supported by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who has accused Beatrice of being solely motivated by profit in claiming royalties from these films, then settling out of court as studios have been keen to avoid costly legal battles.) A clause of Welles' will, specifying that anybody who challenges any part of Kodar's inheritance will be automatically disinherited, remains unenforced \u2013 Kodar sought to have it enforced in the 1990s, but could not afford the legal fees as the case dragged on.\n\nParagraph 18: The doctrine is sometimes said to be rooted in Plato. While Plato never directly stated the doctrine, it was developed, based on his remarks on evil, by the Neoplatonist philosopher Plotinus, chiefly in the eighth tractate of his First Ennead. The following quotation from that tractate, in which evil is described as non-being, illustrates this:As these are real beings, and as the first Principle is their superior, evil could not exist in such beings, and still less in Him, who is superior to them; for all these things are good. Evil then must be located in non-being, and must, so to speak, be its form, referring to the things that mingle with it, or have some community with it. This \"non-being,\" however, is not absolute non-being. Its difference from being resembles the difference between being and movement or rest; but only as its image, or something still more distant from reality. Within this non-being are comprised all sense-objects, and all their passive modifications; or, evil may be something still more inferior, like their accident or principle, or one of the things that contribute to its constitution. To gain some conception of evil it may be represented by the contrast between measure and incommensurability; between indetermination and its goal; between lack of form and the creating principle of form; between lack and self-sufficiency; as the perpetual unlimited and changeableness; as passivity, insatiableness, and absolute poverty. Those are not the mere accidents of evil, but its very essence; all of that can be discovered when any part of evil is examined. The other objects, when they participate in the evil and resemble it, become evil without however being absolute Evil.\n\nParagraph 19: Although Jason has had many romances, all of them were short-lived since he has a fear of commitment. He has had many flings with street residents, Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson) and Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien). He seemed to have settled down with Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt), even uncharacteristically promising to care for her when he thought she was pregnant. Jason is stunned to learn about Violet sharing a drunken kiss with his enemy/employer, Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). He attempts to continue the relationship but is unable to forgive Violet and ends their relationship. During their separation, he starts dating Sarah and despite reconciling with Violet, he continues his affair with her. Eventually, Violet discovers the affair and dumps Jason. Separated from Violet again, Jason and Sarah continue their relationship, much to the dismay of their mothers. Their relationship struggles initially as Sarah feels insecure about his feelings for Violet and the fact he proposed to Sarah while still with Violet, leading to a showdown in which Sarah ends her relationship with Jason in the Rovers. After days of constant quarrels, Jason ultimately decides to get back with Sarah and after she refuses to speak to him, Jason breaks into her house and proposes. She accepts, although they suffer further disapproval from their mothers. They announce their engagement in the Rovers in Violet's presence, which Sarah wants to do to make a point. The wedding, though, is a disaster. Jason develops cold feet and flees through a toilet window at the venue, leaving Sarah heartbroken. After months of ignoring Jason, Sarah reunites with him. However, on Christmas Day 2006, Jason has a major surprise delivered to the front door in the shape of a baby \u2013 supposedly his little girl by a young woman called Emma (Stephanie Waring). It later turns out that baby Holly is the baby of Charlie Stubbs.\n\nParagraph 20: The vessel struck a reef off Bass Point, Shellharbour, late on Wednesday night, and was badly holed. As she appeared likely to founder quickly, she was abandoned, and the crew of 11 rowed to Kiama, five miles away. Returning to the scene early yesterday morning, they were astonished to find that the Incoming tide had refloated the vessel, which was rapidly drifting out to sea. The crew, in the ship's dinghy, reached Kiama at 2 o'clock yesterday morning, and Captain James Reid, the master, reported the matter to the police. The men rested until shortly before daybreak, and then set out in a launch owned by Mr. C. Stead to retrieve their personal belongings. As they drew near the spot where the Koraaga had gone ashore they found she had disappeared, and it was feared that she had already foundered. Within a few minutes, however, the vessel was seen about a mile and a half offshore, drifting southward under the influence of a strong current and a stiff north-easterly breeze. Her trawling flags were still flying, and she gave the appearance of being under control. So much so that, several hours later, two Interstate steamers passed without noticing anything amiss. By noon the trawler, now low in the water, was several miles out to sea. Members of the crew overtook the Koraaga early in the morning and went on board. They found that the engine room was flooded, and the vessel was being kept afloat by watertight compartments. There were then two possibilities, either that she would founder when the weight of water broke down the bulkheads, or that she would go ashore on Gerringong Beach. Word was sent to Sydney, and Cam and Sons, the owners, dispatched the trawler Charlie Cam, equipped with towing gear, to the scene. It was hoped to reach her before she went ashore or sank, and that she would have sufficient buoyancy to enable her to be towed to Sydney. She disappeared, however, before the Charlie Cam had reached the scene, and the salvage trawler was recalled. Worn out by his all day vigil beside the sinking vessel, Captain Reid returned to Kiama at 4 o'clock. He reported that the trawler had heeled over and foundered an hour before, about five miles east of Black Head, Gerringong, 9 miles from Kiama. Captain Reid was on board until just before the foundering. He said that the Koraaga sank in two minutes. The trawling flags and signals were still flying when she disappeared.\n\nParagraph 21: Mental Overdrive is the primary solo moniker of Per Martinsen (born 31 July 1966), one of Norway's most prolific and influential techno musicians. His tracks have ranged from hardcore rave techno to vibrant space-disco, and he's always maintained a healthy balance of humor and braininess. Active since 1990, he began his career releasing several 12\" EPs of aggressive, rave-ready hardcore techno on revered Belgian label R&S, including 12000 AD (1990), The Second Coming (1991), Move! (as Confusion Club, 1991), and The Love EP (1992). In 1994, Martinsen began releasing atmospheric techno singles as part of Illumination, his duo with Nicholas Sillitoe. The next year, Mental Overdrive released the single \"Disto Disco,\" which featured a B-side (\"Faith\") co-written by R&S artist Outlander, best known for the 1991 classic \"Vamp.\" The A-side appeared on Mental Overdrive's full-length debut Plugged, released on Martinsen's own Love OD Communications. The album showed a notable progression in his music, maintaining its rough, distorted hardcore techno sound while adding more cerebral elements, placing it closer to Warp's Artificial Intelligence series. Martinsen displayed his sense of humor with 1996's Unplugged, a limited conceptual release containing silent \"versions\" of the tracks on Plugged.  083 In 1997, Mental Overdrive signed to Virgin and released About Jazz, a significantly more house/disco-influenced EP than his previous work. This was followed by full-length Ad Absurdum, which continued in a more light-hearted and funky direction than his previous releases. He took a few years off from releasing Mental Overdrive recordings, instead devoting time to Frost (his more pop-focused electronic duo with his wife Aggie Peterson) and Illumination, which released two albums on RCA. Following the 2003 release of Mental Overdrive's Me EP on Love OD, he signed to Norwegian label Smalltown Supersound and released full-length 083, which featured the single \"Diskodans.\" In 2005, the label compiled his early R&S material on CD as The Phuture That Never Happened. Two years later, Mental Overdrive's single \"Spooks\" appeared on Prins Thomas' Full Pupp label. The song appeared on his next Smalltown full-length, You Are Being Manipulated, which was released in 2008. The album was perfectly at home with the label's other left-field dance artists like Bj\u00f8rn Torske and Kim Hiorth\u00f8y, while maintaining the unique Mental Overdrive sound. Martinsen continued releasing Mental Overdrive singles on Full Pupp and Love OD, and contributed to Rune Lindb\u00e6k's Meanderthals project. In 2012, he released Man with a Movie Camera, an EP featuring music he'd composed for a 1996 screening of the Russian silent film of the same name, which also featured pieces by Biosphere which would later appear on the 2001 remaster of his classic album Substrata. Mental Overdrive returned to his Love OD label for 2013 full-length Cycls, as well as 2014's Everything Is Connected, which compiled a few previously released EPs. In 2016, Full Pupp sublabel Rett I Fletta released a new version of Plugged consisting of alternate takes sourced from the original DAT tapes.

The city's outdated industry has caused accidents like that of a gas explosion which occurred in June 2008 at one of Yenakiieve's coal mines. Yenakiieve was founded in 1898 when numerous workers' settlements around the Peter's Iron and Steel Works were united into a single settlement named after . Its first coal mines dated from 1883. The settlement was incorporated as a city in 1925. By 1958, the city and factories had expanded significantly and overtook the outlying villages of Simyukuo, Yevrah, and Tsiminyenny, all of which were resettled in their entirety when local livestock could not survive the expanding steel mills' runoff and pollution. One of the oldest metallurgical factories of Ukraine\u2014the Yenakiieve Iron and Steel Works\u2014operates in Yenakiieve.\n\nParagraph 23: Between 1438 and 1446 (several decades before the activities of Leonardo da Vinci), he created manuscripts in Latin on a wide variety of technical subjects, including astronomy, hydraulics, astronomical instruments, and drawings of apparent inventions like a folding ladder and a gem polishing machine. Among the manuscripts is a copy (in Henri's handwriting) of Jacob of Li\u00e8ge's Speculum musicae. The best known part is his treatise on the design and construction of musical instruments, containing, amongst others, the earliest illustration of a harpsichord. He gave  a detailed description of the action and the operation of this keyboard plucked instrument with the complex linkages between the keyboard and the strings. He also described the lute, the clavichord, the dulce melos, and the organ. His description of the organ is more practical than earlier treatises, describing the composition of the diapason chorus and the scaling of the pipes. He describes the layout of pipes, either with the longest in the middle, \"in the form of a bishop's mitre\", or in chromatic order, longest at the left, and he is credited with the first mention of reed pipes. All instruments in his manuscript were to be played at the court and not in churches. The manuscripts were probably only bundled in the 16th century (F-Pn Lat. 7295).\n\nParagraph 24: Several miles upstream (east),  on the canal's south side were purchased in 1888 by a former Civil War chaplain, Major Winfield Scott, establishing what is now Scottsdale. Murphy later built the Ingleside Club hotel near Scottsdale (in what is now Arcadia), laying the foundation for the area's vital tourism economy. Several resorts \u2013 The Phoenician, Biltmore, Royal Palms, a Pointe Hilton and a Ritz-Carlton \u2013 were all built close to the canal between 1929 and 1988. Also, five shopping malls of varying size and affluence \u2013 Borgata, Scottsdale Fashion Square, Biltmore Fashion Park, Metrocenter Mall and Arrowhead Towne Center \u2013 now reside along the canal's route.  Five miles were added to the canal's western end in 1894, completing its  length.\n\nParagraph 25: The riding school was first named during the Habsburg Monarchy in 1572, long before the French manege of Antoine de Pluvinel, and is the oldest of its kind in the world. Records show that a wooden riding arena was first commissioned in 1565, but it wasn't until 1729 that Emperor Charles VI commissioned the architect Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach to build the white riding hall used today. Prior to that time, the school operated from a wooden arena at the Josefsplatz. For a time, the riding hall was used for various ceremonies, but it is now open to the public, who may witness the training and performances by the stallions. \n\nParagraph 26: Kim and Claudette clash at Pearl's first birthday party, and when Claudette's foster son Linford Short (Leon Lopez) announces that she is a finalist in the Pride of Walford Awards, Kim tries to take the attention away by jumping on Pearl's bouncy castle, which Claudette then punctures; Denise tells Kim that Claudette did this deliberately. Kim is horrified when Donna decides she wants Vincent to be a sperm donor so she can have a baby, but Vincent convinces her it is the right thing to do, however, it does not work and Donna changes her mind. When Kim finds out that Denise is pregnant but wants the baby adopted, Kim decides she and Vincent should adopt the child, but Denise is against this. Vincent discovers that Kim has received a parking fine in his car for parking in a bus lane; she discovers that Donna has a disabled parking permit so Kim uses Claudette as a way into Donna's flat and steals the permit to go shopping. Vincent discovers this and tells Donna, who tells her it is wrong; Patrick reveals Kim has never passed her driving test so Vincent bans her from driving his car. Vincent then gives Kim driving lessons, but she is angry that people are taking bets on whether she will pass or fail her test. She also worries when Denise does not want to tell her daughters that she is pregnant; Kim tells Libby, prompting her return to Walford. She passes her driving test but breaks her arm, so she is annoyed that she is unable to drive. Kim and Vincent travel to Montserrat and Denise is upset to learn that Kim has told their mother, Emerald Fox (Do\u00f1a Croll), that Denise is pregnant. Denise gives birth to a boy, but Kim becomes angry when she discovers that Denise still plans to have her son adopted and tries to reason with her. Denise refuses to change her mind, so Kim brands her a \"cold-hearted bitch\". Vincent comforts Kim but advises her to accept and respect Denise's decision otherwise she would lose her sister, however, Kim stands by her own decision and decides to cut all ties with Denise. When Denise survives a bus crash, Denise rejects Kim's support. Kim throws Emerald a farewell dinner and invites Denise but Emerald and Patrick suspect that she has planned it for the same time as Denise's class to make her look bad. Kim embarrasses Denise by interrupting her class and revealing that Denise abandoned her son. An angry but defiant Denise eventually goes to the dinner but confronts Kim, telling her that she realises that Kim still sees Denise as a mother and fears being abandoned by her. At Emerald's leaving party, Kim and Denise stand up for each other against Emerald when she criticises Kim's parenting, and when Kim says she is thankful for her sister, Emerald says they are not really sisters, explaining that Denise was brought to her as a baby. This causes Kim and Denise to reunite. After learning that Denise's friends know the identity of her son's biological father, Kim decides to find out the truth herself, concluding that Denise's former fianc\u00e9 Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the father. Kim confronts Ian but his wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) informs her that he has had a vasectomy so cannot father any more children. Denise eventually tells Kim that Phil is the father, which shocks Kim; Denise begs her not to tell anyone. When Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) suffers a cardiac arrest, Kim assists Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), who performs CPR. Kim is interviewed by a local radio station and plans to use the opportunity to advertise The Albert, but changes her mind after seeing Ian, who has lost his son and business in a fire.\n\nParagraph 27: Launching an assault in February 1918, the Third Army of the Ottoman Empire occupied Western Armenian settlements one after another. Following the failure of Trabzon peace talks in April, Third Army commander Mehmed Wehib Pasha moved his forces towards Transcaucasia. Taking advantage of the conciliatory policy of the leadership of the newly-proclaimed Transcaucasian Federative Republic, the Turkish military units captured the heavily fortified Castle of Kars on 25 April, thus creating a direct threat to Alexandrapol. Following the siege of Kars, the Ottoman Forces Command put forward new conditions to the Transcaucasian authorities, demanding the surrender of Akhalkalaki, Akhaltsikhe and Alexandrapol, as well as of Alexandropol\u2013Julfa railway, which the Turkish troops could use to reach Tabriz and get their hands on all the Transcaucasian railroads before the end of the war against the British. Unwilling to wait for the end of negotiations with the Transcaucasian delegation in Batumi, the Turkish forces took Alexandropol with a quick offensive on 15 May, creating a threat of conquest for all of Eastern Armenia. At this point, only a small area of Armenian territory remained unconquered by the Turks, and into that small area, hundreds of thousands of Armenian refugees fled. It seemed like it was only a matter of time until that too would be overrun.\n\nParagraph 28: Brian Field quickly became successful in both his personal and professional lives, he married a pretty German girl named Karin and rose to be a solicitor's managing clerk for John Wheater & Co. Despite the fact that he was only 28 at the time of the robbery, he was already much more successful than his boss, John Wheater. Field drove a new Jaguar and had a house he called \"Kabri\" (an amalgam of Karin and Brian) with his wife at the Bridle Path, Whitchurch Hill, Oxfordshire, near Pangbourne, while his boss owned a battered Ford and lived in a rundown neighbourhood. Part of the reason for this is that Field was not averse to giving some of his less savoury clients good information on what some of his wealthier clients had in their country houses, making them prime targets for the thieves. Another key reason being that an honest solicitor was useless to a career criminal of that era. What was needed was a bent solicitor who could arrange for alibis and friendly witness statements and bribe police and witnesses. As the managing clerk at his law firm, Field was able to carry out these activities and encourage repeat business. On one occasion he described the contents and layout of a house near Weybridge where his wife Karin had once been a nanny to a couple of criminals that he represented at various times in his career, Gordon Goody and Buster Edwards. He had arranged Buster's defence when he had been caught with a stolen car, and later met Goody at a nightclub in Soho. Field was then called upon to assist in the defence of Goody in the aftermath of the \"Airport Job\" which was a robbery carried out on 27 November 1962 at a branch of Barclays Bank at London Airport. This was the big practice robbery that the South West Gang had done prior to their grand scheme \u2013 the Great Train Robbery. Field was successful in arranging bail for Goody and Charlie Wilson.\n\nParagraph 29:  (2006) The gradual phasing out of the restored stainless steel Budd cars was to have taken place, with all departures in both directions to have been operated in favor of the more modern European-built Renaissance equipment. However, Via has had occasional problems with this equipment and has had to use the Budd cars. Work on upgrading the Renaissance fleet has resulted in the need to operate one Budd consist (with the two other consists Renaissance outfitted) during the winter season. This took place through to the winter of 2011/2012, and ended after the service was reduced to three trips a week, with the exception of extra Budd-equipped trains during the Christmas holidays in 2014 and 2015. A stainless steel Park Car (originally built in 1954) was attached to the end of every train for passengers in Easterly Class (named \"Sleeper Plus\"). Though initially available only during the peak summer season and the Christmas holidays, the Park car was part of every train year-round. The Renaissance cars' European couplers made it necessary to insert a barrier vehicle known as a transition car (numbered 7600\u20137602) between the Renaissance sleeping cars and the Park Car (or other Budd HEP cars). The transition car is converted from a Renaissance sleeper shell and is effectively an empty walk-through corridor with carpeted floor and handrails along the walls.\n\nParagraph 30: Ahmed Shah I laid the foundation of Bhadra Fort starting from Manek Burj, the first bastion of the city in 1411 which was completed in 1413. He also established the first square of the city, Manek Chowk, both associated with the legend of Hindu saint Maneknath. His Gujarat Sultanate (1411-1573) ruled from the city until 1484. His grandson Mahmud Begada transferred capital from Ahmedabad to Muhammadabad from 1484 to 1535 but carried out second fortification of the city. Later Ahmedabad again became capital of sultanate until it fell to Mughals in 1573. During Mughal rule (1572-1707), Bhadra Fort served as the seat of Governor of Gujarat. The city flourished with addition of several settlements in and around the city. Of the population of the city no estimate has been traced. There is some estimate of the size of city in works of the time: Ferishta, the Ain-i-Akbari, and the Mirat-i-Ahmadi. According to the Ain-i-Akbari (1580), there were 360 puras, of which only eighty-four were then flourishing; according to Ferishta there were, in 1600, 360 mahalla, each surrounded by a wall ; the Mirat-i-Ahmadi in one passage says, such was once its populous state that it contained 380 puras, each pura a considerable quarter almost a city; in another passage he mentions twelve city wards and others outside, and in his detailed account of the city he mentions by name 110 suburbs of which 19 were settled under Mughal rule. German traveller Mandelslo (1638) mentioned the suburbs and dependent villages are nearly seven leagues round. During Mughal and Maratha struggle (1707\u20131753) to control the city, the city was harmed and several suburbs were depopulated. The city walls damaged in battles and the trade was affected. The city revenue was divided between Mughal and Maratha rulers.  Later during Maratha rule (1758\u20131817), the city revenue was divided between Peshwa and Gaekwad. These affected the economy of the city due to more extraction of taxes. In 1817, Ahmedabad fell under British Company rule which stabilized the city politically and improved the trade. The population rose from 80,000 in 1817 to about 88,000 in 1824. During the eight following years a special cess was levied on ghee and other products and at a cost of \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000) the city walls were repaired. About the same time a cantonment was established on a site to the north of the city. The population rose (1816) to about 95,000. The remaining public funds  after the walls were finished were used for municipal purposes. The old city continued to be the centre of political activities during the Indian independence movement under Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text discusses the legal complications surrounding the estate of filmmaker Orson Welles and the impact on the completion and distribution of his unfinished film, The Other Side of the Wind.

It is the first true sequel to Dragon's Lair. As with the original, Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp consists of an animated short film that requires the player to move the joystick or press a fire button at certain times in order to continue. It takes place years after the original Dragon's Lair. Dirk has married Daphne, and the marriage has produced many children. When Daphne is kidnapped by the evil wizard Mordroc in order to be forced into marriage, Dirk's children and his mother-in-law are clearly upset by the abduction of Daphne, and Dirk must once again save her.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1914, he moved to Krak\u00f3w and joined the First Cadre Company, which fought on the Austro-Hungarian side against Russia. In October 1914 he became a commander of a platoon of a squadron in . During the fighting in 1914\u20131915, he was promoted to lieutenant, and after the war he was awarded the V-Class Virtuti Militari. In August 1915, he moved to the special group in Warsaw. Soon he became an aide-de-camp to J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. In 1918, he was sent on a mission to Russia. He was given three tasks: persuade General J\u00f3zef Haller's army, then in the Ukraine, to back Pi\u0142sudski (he failed in this task); reach the French military mission in Moscow under General Lavergne (he succeeded in this task); and return from Moscow to Paris to liaise with the government there. Unfortunately, he was arrested by the Soviet Cheka as a member of the Polish Military Organisation while on a French diplomatic train on its way from Moscow to Murmansk (and Paris). He was imprisoned in the Taganka prison. He was freed thanks to the intervention of his future wife, Bronis\u0142awa Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowska, with the much-feared Cheka operative Yakovleva, then in charge of the prison. Bronis\u0142awa, n\u00e9e Kliatchkin, was at that time married to the lawyer , the lawyer of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the head of the Cheka. She was a Lutheran, her family having converted from the Jewish faith when she was eight. He married her in a Lutheran ceremony on 2 October 1919 at Lutheran zb\u00f3r in Nowy Gaw\u0142\u00f3w. The marriage register records the details from her false French passport, including \"Lalande\" as her maiden name.\n\nParagraph 3: After the battle of Stamford Bridge and the death of Harald Hardrada, Skule and Ketel, the two sons of Tostig Godwinson, were taken to Norway under the wing of Hardrada's son Olaf.  Olaf, who became king of Norway, gave land to Ketel and arranged a good marriage for him; according to the 13th-century saga-writer Snorri Sturluson, \"from him are descended many great people\".  Skule became known as Skule Kongsfostre (king's foster-son), and was remembered as a remarkably intelligent and handsome man who commanded the king's hird.  He married a relative of the king, Gudrun Nevsteinsdotter, and their son was \u00c5solv of Rein (in Rissa), father of the lendmann Guttorm of Rein.  Guttorm's son, B\u00e5rd Guttormsson of Rein, was a close friend and supporter of king Sverre Sigurdsson, fought alongside him in several battles, and was rewarded by being given the king's half-sister, Cecilia Sigurdsdotter, in marriage.  B\u00e5rd and Cecilia's son Inge B\u00e5rdsson was born about the year 1185.  In 1204, when the child-king Guttorm Sigurdsson died, the two obvious candidates for the crown were Inge and his half-brother Haakon Galen, Cecilia's son by another husband.  After a struggle for power Inge was recognized as king, while Haakon retained his former command of the army.  This did not produce peace, for a faction known as the Bagler succeeded in splitting the kingdom, with Inge ruling the western half and their own candidate, Philip Simonsson, the eastern half.  Moreover, earl Haakon renewed his own claim to the crown, a claim which only lapsed with his death in 1214.  King Inge himself died in 1217.  Since 1213 the leader of the army and the hird had been Inge's half-brother Skule, a son of B\u00e5rd Guttormsson by another wife, Ragnfrid Erlingsdotter, and therefore, like king Inge, fifth in descent in the male line from Tostig Godwinson.  The new king, Haakon IV, was no more than a boy, with Skule acting as his regent.  In 1225 Skule married his young daughter, Margrete, to the king, but this did not succeed in establishing perfect amity between the two men, and in 1239 Skule went into open rebellion, claiming the title of king for himself.  The subsequent war went against him, and he was killed in 1240.  From Haakon IV and Margrete Skulesdotter descend subsequent kings of Norway down to the present day.\n\nParagraph 4: The Israel Police is responsible for investigations and arrests regarding civilian crimes. If the Israel Police learns of a possible criminal offense through a complaint by a private citizen or through other evidence, it then decides whether or not to open an investigation. In the case of an offense other than a felony, a police officer with the rank of captain or higher is entitled to order that no investigation take place if the officer is of the opinion that no public interest is involved or another authority is legally competent to carry out the investigation. During a police investigation, a judge must issue a search warrant for police to search a home or review computer material, though a police officer may search a home without a warrant if there are reasonable grounds to assume a felony is being committed there or was recently committed there. Any search either with or without a warrant must be conducted in the presence of two witnesses who are not police officers unless the circumstances and urgency of the case do not allow it, a judge permitted it, or the owner of the property or one of the household members requested that it not be conducted in the presence of witnesses. If the police wish to arrest a suspect following an investigation, an arrest warrant must be obtained from a judge. The police must present evidence to the judge, who will issue a warrant only if satisfied that there is reasonable suspicion that the person committed an offense. A police officer is entitled to carry out an arrest without a warrant if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the suspect committed an offense and if one of the following conditions are met: the suspected offense was committed in the officer's presence or in the recent past, there is a reasonable suspicion that the suspect will not appear for investigative procedures, there is reasonable suspicion that the suspect will disrupt trial proceedings, there is reasonable suspicion that the suspect's continued freedom will constitute a danger to the public, committed a select number of serious violent crimes, drug crimes, or security crimes, or there are reasonable grounds to suspect a suspect violated bail or escaped lawful custody.\n\nParagraph 5: Nicholas's son Charles (1662\u20131740), the 4th earl, had not been summoned to parliament when in 1692 he killed his brother-in-law, Captain Philip Lawson, in a duel. This raised the question of his rank in a new form. Was he, or was he not, entitled to trial by the peers? The House of Lords declared that he was not a peer and therefore not so entitled, but the Court of King's Bench released him from his imprisonment on the ground that he was the Earl of Banbury and not Charles Knowles, a commoner. Nevertheless, the House of Lords refused to move from its position, and Knowles had not received a writ of summons when he died in April 1740. He seems to have been the classic Restoration rake, dissolute and riotous. He dissipated an estate of \u00a320,000 a year and appears to have had so loose a grasp of the concept of marriage that the word bigamous did not even begin to describe his conjugal exploits. He was legitimately married twice and left children, all of whom were baptised Knowles, and whose descendants are alive today. His son Charles (1703\u20131771), vicar of Burford, Oxfordshire, and his grandsons, Sir William (1726\u20131776) and Sir Thomas Woods (1727\u20131793), were successively titular Earls of Banbury, but they took no steps to prove their title. His natural son Admiral Sir Charles Knowles Bt ( 1704\u20131777) rose to become Rear Admiral of Great Britain and was created a baronet in 1765 of Lovell Hill, and from whom descends the present holder of the baronetcy. The Naval Chronicle of 1799 stated that \u201c\u2026he was the natural son of an earl of Bambury\u2026.and a French gentlewoman of rank and uncommon beauty, whom he seduced: circumstances made her case to be pitied and she was much noted by Lord and Lady Wallingford.\u201d\n\nParagraph 6: Raja next began work on the family drama film Santosh Subramaniam (2008), a remake of the Telugu film Bommarillu (2006), after outbidding several other interested parties for the remake rights. The film's original version was made by Raja's friend, Bhaskar, who also stated that Raja would be the most apt director to remake the film into the Tamil language. Ravi and Prakash Raj were chosen again to play lead roles, while Genelia D'Souza was selected as the film's heroine, after winning acclaim for her portrayal of the role in the original version. The film revolved around a father and son relationship; where the son's choices and his ambitions to achieve something in life are subdued by his father, and Raja related the storyline back to his personal life. Santosh Subramaniam opened to positive reviews from critics, with Raja winning critical acclaim for his work. A critic from Sify.com noted \"Raja, a past master at remakes, is once again a winner\" and that the film \"has simple charm, immensely likeable characters, and the intrinsic humour in the writing makes it a must watch\". Similarly, a critic from The Hindu noted \"for the fourth time in succession film-maker Raja shows he can re-make a film to suit the audiences here\", stating the script was \"aptly re-tuned to suit the Tamil milieu\". The film also went on to be ranked amongst the Best Tamil films of the year by the Tamil Nadu State, while it also garnered four Filmfare Award nominations, including one for Best Film. Moreover, it became a very profitable venture for the makers, running for over 100 days in theatres across Tamil Nadu. The producers, AGS Entertainment, subsequently requested Raja to make another film with Ravi after Santosh Subramaniam'''s success, but Raja gave Ravi's dates to director Prabhu Deva to film Engeyum Kaadhal (2011).\n\nParagraph 7: Led by Usma bin Luai, the Tayy invaded the mountains of Ajaa and Salma from Banu Assad and Banu Tamim in northern Arabia in their exodus from Yemen in 115 CE. These mountains were renamed to Jabal Tayy (Tayy's Mountain), and then again in the 14th century, after the tribe changed their name, to Jabal Shammar. There, Tayy, later Shammar, became either city-dwellers in the city of Ha'il, nomadic pastoralists, camel-herders and horse-breeders in northern Najd, or agriculturists in the countryside outside Ha'il or in the surrounding desert oases. These divisions were based on profession, personal interest and skill, and not family or blood-line stratifications within the tribe. It is common for the same nuclear family to have members living each of the three different lifestyles. Because of their strength and blood relations with the Yemenite dynasties that came to rule Syria (Ghassanids) and Iraq (Muntherids), the Tayy expanded north into Iraq all the way to al-Hira, the capital at the time. Oral tradition mentions that the first chiefs of the Shammar tribe, Arar and Omair, were of the 'Abda family of Dhaigham, who ruled Shammar from Jabal Shammar. In the 17th century, a large section of the Shammar left Jabal Shammar under the leadership of the Al Jarba and settled in Iraq, reaching as far as the northern city of Mosul, their current stronghold. The Shammar are currently one of Iraq's largest tribes and are divided into two geographical, as opposed to genealogical, subsections. The northern branch, known as Shammar al-Jarba, is mainly Sunni, while the southern branch, Shammar Toga, converted to Shia Islam around the 19th century after settling in southern Iraq.\n\nParagraph 8: Between 1255 and 1256 the people of lower Gwynedd were chafing under the heavy tax burden imposed by Geoffrey of Langley, a royal favorite and lieutenant in the region who sought to extend the English shire system there. Prince Edward made a tour of his holdings of Chester as its earl, and then progressed into the Perfeddwlad to inspect his castles of Diserth and Deganwy. After Edward's departure, when it became clear to the Welsh of the region that the English prince was not inclined to intervene on their behalf over Langley's 'tyrannous exactions,\u2019 they rose in revolt and appealed to Llywelyn II for aid. Furthermore, Prince Edward appointed Patrick Chaworth as Steward of Carmarthen, an appointment that \"could hardly be tolerated by Llywelyn who was already bitter and resentful\" over the conditions in lower Gwynedd, whose people appealed for his deliverance. Having reconciled with Dafydd, Llywelyn II released his brother who he thought would be a valuable lieutenant, then gathered an army and crossed the river Conwy. Within one week Llywelyn II swept eastwards almost as far as Chester itself, stretching Gwynedd's princely domain \"to its old bounds,\" wrote Lloyd. Only the castles at Deganwy and Diserth were left as islets under siege in what was now \"purely Welsh country\" again. Prince Edward and his lieutenant Geoffrey of Langley, who had been in England during the week of Llywelyn's campaign, were powerless to respond as they, and the English crown, lacked any treasury for retaliatory measures against the Welsh prince. And the English crown was abandoned by yet another ally against Llywelyn, the Marcher lords, who \"sympathized with the insurgents as victims of a common tyranny, and the very barons of the March, hereditary foes of the Welsh, viewed their rebellion with toleration, if not actual friendliness,\" wrote Lloyd. The Marcher lords were suspicious of growing royal authority over the March since the Peace of Woodstock. The inability of the crown to launch any response and the ambivilance so far expressed by other Marcher lords emboldened Llywelyn towards further campaigns. First, he recovered Meirionydd, recovered for Gwynedd the royal holdings of Lanbadarn and Builth, then took Gwerthrynion from his cousin Roger II Mortimer. In South and West Wales, Llywelyn ejected Rhys Fychan from the Ystrad Tywi region and restored Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg to both Cantref Mawr and Cantref Bychan. Llywelyn held his 1256 Christmas court at Aber, one which was \"certainly not wanting in elements of festivity,\" wrote Lloyd. In January 1257 Llywelyn harassed Powys Fadog, already ravaged from the prior year's campaigns, and then conquered Powys Wynwynwyn as far as Pool, driving out Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn. Pushing into Glamorgan, Llywelyn campaigned between the rivers Towy and Tawe where he enlisted the Welsh of the Gower, Kidwelly, and Carnwyllion to his side, thereby undermining the Marcher authority of the barons Patrick Chaworth and William de Braose. A hapless King Henry III sought the aid of his brother Richard, who had just been elected as Holy Roman Emperor, but though Llywelyn II and the emperor exchanged courteous and amicable correspondence, Llywelyn II refused to yield any of his conquests, but agreed to a long truce, one which allow Llywelyn to consolidate his gains. Before Easter 1257, Llywelyn was home in Gwynedd.\n\nParagraph 9: In 2010 Quackenbush became embroiled in a feud with Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (BDK), who had formed on the final show of 2009 and were threatening to take over Chikara, with its members quickly winning the Young Lions Cup, Campeonatos de Parejas and King of Trios, while also having one of its members as the Chikara Director of Fun. After UltraMantis Black declared that rudos and tecnicos would have to come together in order to stop BDK, Quackenbush announced on August 11 that he would join his seven man team facing BDK in the annual torneo cibernetico match on October 23. After defeating The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) and BDK members Lince Dorado and Pinkie Sanchez, Quackenbush and Jigsaw were looking to get a shot at BDK's Claudio Castagnoli and Ares and their Campeonatos de Parejas. However, on August 27 Quackenbush and Jigsaw failed in their attempt at getting a third point by losing to BDK members Daizee Haze and Sara Del Rey, after some shady officiating from the stable's own referee Derek Sabato. The following day Quackenbush and Jigsaw restarted their march towards three points by defeating the House of Truth (Josh Raymond and Christian Abel). On September 18 they picked up their second point by defeating BDK's Lince Dorado and Tim Donst. On October 23 Quackenbush represented Chikara in the torneo cibernetico match, where the company's originals faced BDK. He managed to eliminate Tim Donst from the match after countering his Inverted Chikara Special into the original Chikara Special, but was immediately afterwards eliminated himself by BDK's Claudio Castagnoli. The following day Quackenbush and Jigsaw once again failed in their attempt at getting their third point in a match against BDK members Pinkie Sanchez and Tursas. This failure led to Quackenbush's and Jigsaw's former partner Stigma reminding them that he and Quackenbush still had the three points they had earned two and a half years earlier, but Quackenbush made it clear that he wanted to win the Campeonatos de Parejas with Jigsaw, not Stigma. On November 22 Quackenbush and Jigsaw competed in a four\u2013way elimination match with Sara Del Rey and Daizee Haze, The Osirian Portal and F.I.S.T. (Icarus and Chuck Taylor) and after eliminating all three teams, finally earned the three points needed in order to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas. On December 12, 2010, at the season nine finale Reality is Relative Quackenbush and Jigsaw cashed in their points and defeated Ares and Castagnoli two falls to one to win the Campeonatos de Parejas for the first time. Quackenbush and Jigsaw made their first successful defense of the title on February 19, 2011, defeating The Batiri (Obariyon and Kodama). For the 2011 King of Trios, Quackenbush and Jigsaw formed a trio with Japanese joshi legend Manami Toyota, who had made her Chikara debut alongside Quackenbush the previous September, and on April 15 defeated Amazing Red, Joel Maximo and Wil Maximo in their first round match. The following day, the trio was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinal stage by Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki). On September 18, Quackenbush and Jigsaw lost the Campeonatos de Parejas to F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano) in their third defense. From May to October 2011, Quackenbush took part in 12 Large: Summit, a tournament used to determine the first ever Chikara Grand Champion. Quackenbush ended up winning his block of the tournament with a record of four wins and one loss to set up a final match with the winner of the other block, Eddie Kingston. On November 13 at Chikara's first internet pay-per-view, High Noon, Quackenbush was defeated by Kingston in a match to determine the first Chikara Grand Champion.\n\nParagraph 10: The National Research Programmes (NRP) and National Centres of Competence in Research (NCCR) are the most important research programmes of the SNSF. Mandated by the Federal Council, NRPs generate scientific knowledge aimed at solving pressing problems. They generally run for up to five years and have an overall budget of eight to twelve million Swiss francs. Since 1975, the SNSF has launched over 69 NRPs. NCCRs aim to strengthen research structures in Switzerland. Each NCCR is based at an institution of higher education and consists of a centre of competence as well as a national and international network. NCCRs benefit from SNSF funding of 20 to 60 million Swiss francs over a period of ten to twelve years, as well as university and third party funding.\n\nParagraph 11: Kagami\u014d was the first wrestler from Kagamiyama stable to make the top division since his coach took control of it seventeen years previously. At the time he was also the second longest to reach makuuchi among foreign born wrestlers, at 62 tournament from his professional debut. In an interview about his promotion, talking about his lengthy rise, he happily joked, \"for me it felt quite quick, I thought it was going to take me 15 years.\" During the interview he also announced his engagement to his Mongolian girlfriend. However, his makuuchi performance was lackluster. In one of his relegation trips back to j\u016bry\u014d in May 2015, he was involved in yet another championship playoff round. In it, he won a preliminary playoff bout against Mongolian Seir\u014d only to lose the following final playoff bout to another Mongolian, the up and comer and future sekiwake Ichinoj\u014d, who he had previously defeated on the 9th day of the tournament. Despite his championship playoff loss, his regular tournament record of 11\u20134 at the rank of j\u016bry\u014d 1 was still enough for him to achieve makuuchi re-promotion for the July 2014 tournament, though two consecutive losing tournaments would put him right back in j\u016bry\u014d In this, his third relegation to j\u016bry\u014d, in March 2015, he only managed a 4\u201311 at j\u016bry\u014d 1. However, in the following May tournament, at j\u016bry\u014d 9 he posted an impressive 12\u20133 record, beating Hidenoumi on the last day to avoid a playoff, and finally taking the championship on his third chance. His record and championship earned him his fourth promotion to the top division for the July tournament in Nagoya. There he finally achieved a majority of wins or kachi-koshi in the top division, but he only managed four wins in the following tournament in September 2015 and was demoted back to j\u016bry\u014d for the fourth time. In May 2016 he was injured in a match with Tenkaih\u014d and had to withdraw from the tournament, falling to makushita as a result. In September 2017 he won the makushita division championship with a perfect 7\u20130 record. Following more injury problems he fell to the sandanme division in July 2018, but he won the championship there with an undefeated 7\u20130 score. In October it was announced that he was changing his shikona given name from Nanji to Hideoki. Continuing injury problems saw him pull out of five successive tournaments between July 2020 and March 2021 and fall from makushita to the jonidan division. He transferred to the Isenoumi stable following Kagamiyama stable's closure after the July 2021 tournament, but his continued absence from competition meant he fell off the banzuke completely in September 2021.\n\nParagraph 12: A British colonel, retired from MI5, though sometimes still active for the British government, Clifton functions as an amateur sleuth, and his phlegmatic approach to stress leads to humorous situations. Harold Clifton lives in Puddington, near London, supported by housekeeper Miss Partridge, who makes a prize-winning goulash. Clifton drives a red MG TD from the early fifties, which gets mangled in most stories, but is repaired regardless of cost. Clifton's hobbies include Boy Scouting (he's Boy Scoutmaster Singing Heron), cats, and collecting cigar wraps. In Pass\u00e9 Compos\u00e9 it was established that Clifton served in the RAF as a group captain during World War II before joining the Secret Service. He also ascended to knighthood in the issue Mortelle Saison for saving a member of the Royal family.\n\nParagraph 13: Three spot gourami are native to standing or slow-moving freshwater habitats in southeastern Asia, ranging from Yunnan (China), through mainland southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) to Indonesia (Java, Borneo and Sumatra). They have been widely introduced outside their native range, such as the Philippines, India, Sulawesi, and southwestern Trinidad. These fish live in marshes, swamps, canals, and lowland wetlands. They migrate during the flood season from permanent water bodies to flooded areas, such as seasonally flooded forests in the middle and lower Mekong. During the dry season, they return to these permanent water bodies. These fish feed on zooplankton, crustaceans, and insect larvae. The male builds a bubble nest for the eggs, which he protects aggressively.\n\nParagraph 14: In 1956 Gamal Abdel Nasser, the president of Egypt at the time, chose him to be the only Coptic Christian Minister (Secretary) of supply and trade in the Egyptian cabinet. He held this post for 14 years. He was also the Deputy Prime Minister for the last 6 years of his appointment. During his career, he developed several systems to help the Egyptian poor. He launched a program to sell food staples to the public at subsidized prices through government-owned stores. These stores are still in operation as of 2020. He also developed a system to offer food  ration cards to the poor to insure that they had enough sustenance.\n\nParagraph 15: The Hormones were a rock band formed in London in 1996. Carroll was the sole songwriter for the group, whose sound was described as a mixture between Teenage Fanclub and Stiff Little Fingers. Carroll was the founding member and songwriter for the band who released their debut single in 1996 as part of the Trade2/Island records singles club. The band members were Jez Housden on Bass and former Guns n' Wankers and Wildhearts drummer, Pat Walters. The group eventually signed to Richard Branson's V2 label and released 5 singles. The third single \"Mr. Wilson\" was Carroll's tribute to Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, the lyrics almost entirely consisting of Beach Boys song titles. Brian Wilson heard the track and Carroll was invited to the legendary songwriter's birthday show at New York City's Beacon Theatre in 1999. An album, Where Old Ghosts Meet (a reference from On Raglan Road by Patrick Kavanagh) was released in 1998 but deleted the same week. It has been listed in a book 101 Irish Records You Need to Hear Before You Die. The band featured in the wedding episode of US TV show Friends. A track written by Carroll and originally issued as a B-side, \"Tired Old Souls\", was featured in the program. The band toured consistently throughout the UK and Europe. Carroll also performed with the Scottish Poet/Songwriter Eric Bogle at the Weavers Club in London in 1996. The band opened for The Cranberries on a European tour in 1999. A 2CD edition of the album was issued in Japan on the Excellent label in 2002 in a limited run of 1000 copies. The bonus disc featured B-sides and unreleased material. A second pressing of the vinyl edition was issued on the Velvet label in Japan in a pressing of 500 copies. The band split in 1999 after a show in Madrid, Spain and the recorded output remains out of print. A multi disc (6CD) bootleg set, \"On A Quiet Street \u2013 The Complete Where Old Ghosts Meet Sessions\" was released on the Last Waltz label in Japan in 2003. It included demos, outtakes, alternate mixes, radio sessions and unreleased material. Carroll has never performed any of these songs live since 1999. The Hormones released 5 singles from the Where Old Ghosts Meet album, with each single featuring 3 exclusive non album B-sides which added up to 15 extra songs that were not included on the original album.\n\nParagraph 16: Zara awakens to find her family close by but without the ability to speak or move. Initially, the doctors explain that it might be due to her spinal injuries. Later on, doctors say that she has gone into shock and does not have the will to live; there is nothing wrong physically with her. It is implied to the viewer that she has lost the will to struggle as she realizes that she has pushed everyone away from her in pursuit of what she thought was important and was all alone when what should have been her biggest triumph of finally buying the parents' house back. Saad, her fianc\u00e9, prefers to have a very strong, smart and pretty wife to project success in life. Saad becomes unsure about Zara after her accident as the doctors are skeptical about her recovery. Zara notices that Saad has lost interest in her and decides to return the engagement ring, which she eventually throws away in the garbage. Saad leaves Pakistan and travels abroad. Zara's family try to reassure her regarding the love and affection they have for her. During this time, Zain is shown to be very concerned for Zara's well-being. The closeness between Zara and Zain disturbs Vida (his fianc\u00e9e); Zain's father senses this and insists that Zain marries Vida as he had promised her parents a long time back. Zain agrees to his father's wishes. Zain then meets Zara and tells her that he has to leave Pakistan and go to Canada after marrying Vida, and he wants to see Zara up and about before that. Upon hearing this, Zara takes hesitant steps and is able to walk. An overjoyed Zain recounts this to Vida, who comments that he must be the happiest man on earth. She tells him that she is happy for him and urges him to see clearly as he is madly in love with Zara. She tells him that she has explained the whole situation to Zain's father and would be flying off to Canada alone.\n\nParagraph 17: However, continuing legal complications in the Welles estate and a lawsuit by Welles' daughter, Beatrice Welles, caused the project to be suspended. When Welles died in 1985 he had left many of his assets to his estranged widow Paola Mori, and after her own death in 1986, these were inherited by their daughter, Beatrice Welles. However, he had also left various other assets, from his house in Los Angeles to the full ownership and artistic control of all his unfinished film projects, to his long-time companion, mistress and collaborator Oja Kodar, who co-wrote and co-starred in The Other Side of the Wind. Since 1992, Beatrice Welles has claimed in various courts that under California law, she had ownership of all of Orson Welles' completed and incomplete pictures (including those which he did not own the rights of himself in his own life), and The Other Side of the Wind has been heavily affected by this litigation. The Guardian described how she \"stifled an attempt by US cable company Showtime and Oja Kodar (Welles's partner in the latter part of his life) to complete The Other Side of the Wind\", while The Daily Telegraph stated that Beatrice Welles had \"blocked\" the film. Matters have been exacerbated by much personal animosity between Oja Kodar and Beatrice Welles \u2013 Beatrice blames Kodar for causing the break-up of her parents' marriage, while Kodar blames Beatrice for attempting to block the screening or re-release of a number of her father's works, including Citizen Kane, Othello, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight and Filming Othello. (The latter claim has been supported by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who has accused Beatrice of being solely motivated by profit in claiming royalties from these films, then settling out of court as studios have been keen to avoid costly legal battles.) A clause of Welles' will, specifying that anybody who challenges any part of Kodar's inheritance will be automatically disinherited, remains unenforced \u2013 Kodar sought to have it enforced in the 1990s, but could not afford the legal fees as the case dragged on.\n\nParagraph 18: The doctrine is sometimes said to be rooted in Plato. While Plato never directly stated the doctrine, it was developed, based on his remarks on evil, by the Neoplatonist philosopher Plotinus, chiefly in the eighth tractate of his First Ennead. The following quotation from that tractate, in which evil is described as non-being, illustrates this:As these are real beings, and as the first Principle is their superior, evil could not exist in such beings, and still less in Him, who is superior to them; for all these things are good. Evil then must be located in non-being, and must, so to speak, be its form, referring to the things that mingle with it, or have some community with it. This \"non-being,\" however, is not absolute non-being. Its difference from being resembles the difference between being and movement or rest; but only as its image, or something still more distant from reality. Within this non-being are comprised all sense-objects, and all their passive modifications; or, evil may be something still more inferior, like their accident or principle, or one of the things that contribute to its constitution. To gain some conception of evil it may be represented by the contrast between measure and incommensurability; between indetermination and its goal; between lack of form and the creating principle of form; between lack and self-sufficiency; as the perpetual unlimited and changeableness; as passivity, insatiableness, and absolute poverty. Those are not the mere accidents of evil, but its very essence; all of that can be discovered when any part of evil is examined. The other objects, when they participate in the evil and resemble it, become evil without however being absolute Evil.\n\nParagraph 19: Although Jason has had many romances, all of them were short-lived since he has a fear of commitment. He has had many flings with street residents, Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson) and Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien). He seemed to have settled down with Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt), even uncharacteristically promising to care for her when he thought she was pregnant. Jason is stunned to learn about Violet sharing a drunken kiss with his enemy/employer, Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). He attempts to continue the relationship but is unable to forgive Violet and ends their relationship. During their separation, he starts dating Sarah and despite reconciling with Violet, he continues his affair with her. Eventually, Violet discovers the affair and dumps Jason. Separated from Violet again, Jason and Sarah continue their relationship, much to the dismay of their mothers. Their relationship struggles initially as Sarah feels insecure about his feelings for Violet and the fact he proposed to Sarah while still with Violet, leading to a showdown in which Sarah ends her relationship with Jason in the Rovers. After days of constant quarrels, Jason ultimately decides to get back with Sarah and after she refuses to speak to him, Jason breaks into her house and proposes. She accepts, although they suffer further disapproval from their mothers. They announce their engagement in the Rovers in Violet's presence, which Sarah wants to do to make a point. The wedding, though, is a disaster. Jason develops cold feet and flees through a toilet window at the venue, leaving Sarah heartbroken. After months of ignoring Jason, Sarah reunites with him. However, on Christmas Day 2006, Jason has a major surprise delivered to the front door in the shape of a baby \u2013 supposedly his little girl by a young woman called Emma (Stephanie Waring). It later turns out that baby Holly is the baby of Charlie Stubbs.\n\nParagraph 20: The vessel struck a reef off Bass Point, Shellharbour, late on Wednesday night, and was badly holed. As she appeared likely to founder quickly, she was abandoned, and the crew of 11 rowed to Kiama, five miles away. Returning to the scene early yesterday morning, they were astonished to find that the Incoming tide had refloated the vessel, which was rapidly drifting out to sea. The crew, in the ship's dinghy, reached Kiama at 2 o'clock yesterday morning, and Captain James Reid, the master, reported the matter to the police. The men rested until shortly before daybreak, and then set out in a launch owned by Mr. C. Stead to retrieve their personal belongings. As they drew near the spot where the Koraaga had gone ashore they found she had disappeared, and it was feared that she had already foundered. Within a few minutes, however, the vessel was seen about a mile and a half offshore, drifting southward under the influence of a strong current and a stiff north-easterly breeze. Her trawling flags were still flying, and she gave the appearance of being under control. So much so that, several hours later, two Interstate steamers passed without noticing anything amiss. By noon the trawler, now low in the water, was several miles out to sea. Members of the crew overtook the Koraaga early in the morning and went on board. They found that the engine room was flooded, and the vessel was being kept afloat by watertight compartments. There were then two possibilities, either that she would founder when the weight of water broke down the bulkheads, or that she would go ashore on Gerringong Beach. Word was sent to Sydney, and Cam and Sons, the owners, dispatched the trawler Charlie Cam, equipped with towing gear, to the scene. It was hoped to reach her before she went ashore or sank, and that she would have sufficient buoyancy to enable her to be towed to Sydney. She disappeared, however, before the Charlie Cam had reached the scene, and the salvage trawler was recalled. Worn out by his all day vigil beside the sinking vessel, Captain Reid returned to Kiama at 4 o'clock. He reported that the trawler had heeled over and foundered an hour before, about five miles east of Black Head, Gerringong, 9 miles from Kiama. Captain Reid was on board until just before the foundering. He said that the Koraaga sank in two minutes. The trawling flags and signals were still flying when she disappeared.\n\nParagraph 21: Mental Overdrive is the primary solo moniker of Per Martinsen (born 31 July 1966), one of Norway's most prolific and influential techno musicians. His tracks have ranged from hardcore rave techno to vibrant space-disco, and he's always maintained a healthy balance of humor and braininess. Active since 1990, he began his career releasing several 12\" EPs of aggressive, rave-ready hardcore techno on revered Belgian label R&S, including 12000 AD (1990), The Second Coming (1991), Move! (as Confusion Club, 1991), and The Love EP (1992). In 1994, Martinsen began releasing atmospheric techno singles as part of Illumination, his duo with Nicholas Sillitoe. The next year, Mental Overdrive released the single \"Disto Disco,\" which featured a B-side (\"Faith\") co-written by R&S artist Outlander, best known for the 1991 classic \"Vamp.\" The A-side appeared on Mental Overdrive's full-length debut Plugged, released on Martinsen's own Love OD Communications. The album showed a notable progression in his music, maintaining its rough, distorted hardcore techno sound while adding more cerebral elements, placing it closer to Warp's Artificial Intelligence series. Martinsen displayed his sense of humor with 1996's Unplugged, a limited conceptual release containing silent \"versions\" of the tracks on Plugged.  083 In 1997, Mental Overdrive signed to Virgin and released About Jazz, a significantly more house/disco-influenced EP than his previous work. This was followed by full-length Ad Absurdum, which continued in a more light-hearted and funky direction than his previous releases. He took a few years off from releasing Mental Overdrive recordings, instead devoting time to Frost (his more pop-focused electronic duo with his wife Aggie Peterson) and Illumination, which released two albums on RCA. Following the 2003 release of Mental Overdrive's Me EP on Love OD, he signed to Norwegian label Smalltown Supersound and released full-length 083, which featured the single \"Diskodans.\" In 2005, the label compiled his early R&S material on CD as The Phuture That Never Happened. Two years later, Mental Overdrive's single \"Spooks\" appeared on Prins Thomas' Full Pupp label. The song appeared on his next Smalltown full-length, You Are Being Manipulated, which was released in 2008. The album was perfectly at home with the label's other left-field dance artists like Bj\u00f8rn Torske and Kim Hiorth\u00f8y, while maintaining the unique Mental Overdrive sound. Martinsen continued releasing Mental Overdrive singles on Full Pupp and Love OD, and contributed to Rune Lindb\u00e6k's Meanderthals project. In 2012, he released Man with a Movie Camera, an EP featuring music he'd composed for a 1996 screening of the Russian silent film of the same name, which also featured pieces by Biosphere which would later appear on the 2001 remaster of his classic album Substrata. Mental Overdrive returned to his Love OD label for 2013 full-length Cycls, as well as 2014's Everything Is Connected, which compiled a few previously released EPs. In 2016, Full Pupp sublabel Rett I Fletta released a new version of Plugged consisting of alternate takes sourced from the original DAT tapes.

The city's outdated industry has caused accidents like that of a gas explosion which occurred in June 2008 at one of Yenakiieve's coal mines. Yenakiieve was founded in 1898 when numerous workers' settlements around the Peter's Iron and Steel Works were united into a single settlement named after . Its first coal mines dated from 1883. The settlement was incorporated as a city in 1925. By 1958, the city and factories had expanded significantly and overtook the outlying villages of Simyukuo, Yevrah, and Tsiminyenny, all of which were resettled in their entirety when local livestock could not survive the expanding steel mills' runoff and pollution. One of the oldest metallurgical factories of Ukraine\u2014the Yenakiieve Iron and Steel Works\u2014operates in Yenakiieve.\n\nParagraph 23: Between 1438 and 1446 (several decades before the activities of Leonardo da Vinci), he created manuscripts in Latin on a wide variety of technical subjects, including astronomy, hydraulics, astronomical instruments, and drawings of apparent inventions like a folding ladder and a gem polishing machine. Among the manuscripts is a copy (in Henri's handwriting) of Jacob of Li\u00e8ge's Speculum musicae. The best known part is his treatise on the design and construction of musical instruments, containing, amongst others, the earliest illustration of a harpsichord. He gave  a detailed description of the action and the operation of this keyboard plucked instrument with the complex linkages between the keyboard and the strings. He also described the lute, the clavichord, the dulce melos, and the organ. His description of the organ is more practical than earlier treatises, describing the composition of the diapason chorus and the scaling of the pipes. He describes the layout of pipes, either with the longest in the middle, \"in the form of a bishop's mitre\", or in chromatic order, longest at the left, and he is credited with the first mention of reed pipes. All instruments in his manuscript were to be played at the court and not in churches. The manuscripts were probably only bundled in the 16th century (F-Pn Lat. 7295).\n\nParagraph 24: Several miles upstream (east),  on the canal's south side were purchased in 1888 by a former Civil War chaplain, Major Winfield Scott, establishing what is now Scottsdale. Murphy later built the Ingleside Club hotel near Scottsdale (in what is now Arcadia), laying the foundation for the area's vital tourism economy. Several resorts \u2013 The Phoenician, Biltmore, Royal Palms, a Pointe Hilton and a Ritz-Carlton \u2013 were all built close to the canal between 1929 and 1988. Also, five shopping malls of varying size and affluence \u2013 Borgata, Scottsdale Fashion Square, Biltmore Fashion Park, Metrocenter Mall and Arrowhead Towne Center \u2013 now reside along the canal's route.  Five miles were added to the canal's western end in 1894, completing its  length.\n\nParagraph 25: The riding school was first named during the Habsburg Monarchy in 1572, long before the French manege of Antoine de Pluvinel, and is the oldest of its kind in the world. Records show that a wooden riding arena was first commissioned in 1565, but it wasn't until 1729 that Emperor Charles VI commissioned the architect Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach to build the white riding hall used today. Prior to that time, the school operated from a wooden arena at the Josefsplatz. For a time, the riding hall was used for various ceremonies, but it is now open to the public, who may witness the training and performances by the stallions. \n\nParagraph 26: Kim and Claudette clash at Pearl's first birthday party, and when Claudette's foster son Linford Short (Leon Lopez) announces that she is a finalist in the Pride of Walford Awards, Kim tries to take the attention away by jumping on Pearl's bouncy castle, which Claudette then punctures; Denise tells Kim that Claudette did this deliberately. Kim is horrified when Donna decides she wants Vincent to be a sperm donor so she can have a baby, but Vincent convinces her it is the right thing to do, however, it does not work and Donna changes her mind. When Kim finds out that Denise is pregnant but wants the baby adopted, Kim decides she and Vincent should adopt the child, but Denise is against this. Vincent discovers that Kim has received a parking fine in his car for parking in a bus lane; she discovers that Donna has a disabled parking permit so Kim uses Claudette as a way into Donna's flat and steals the permit to go shopping. Vincent discovers this and tells Donna, who tells her it is wrong; Patrick reveals Kim has never passed her driving test so Vincent bans her from driving his car. Vincent then gives Kim driving lessons, but she is angry that people are taking bets on whether she will pass or fail her test. She also worries when Denise does not want to tell her daughters that she is pregnant; Kim tells Libby, prompting her return to Walford. She passes her driving test but breaks her arm, so she is annoyed that she is unable to drive. Kim and Vincent travel to Montserrat and Denise is upset to learn that Kim has told their mother, Emerald Fox (Do\u00f1a Croll), that Denise is pregnant. Denise gives birth to a boy, but Kim becomes angry when she discovers that Denise still plans to have her son adopted and tries to reason with her. Denise refuses to change her mind, so Kim brands her a \"cold-hearted bitch\". Vincent comforts Kim but advises her to accept and respect Denise's decision otherwise she would lose her sister, however, Kim stands by her own decision and decides to cut all ties with Denise. When Denise survives a bus crash, Denise rejects Kim's support. Kim throws Emerald a farewell dinner and invites Denise but Emerald and Patrick suspect that she has planned it for the same time as Denise's class to make her look bad. Kim embarrasses Denise by interrupting her class and revealing that Denise abandoned her son. An angry but defiant Denise eventually goes to the dinner but confronts Kim, telling her that she realises that Kim still sees Denise as a mother and fears being abandoned by her. At Emerald's leaving party, Kim and Denise stand up for each other against Emerald when she criticises Kim's parenting, and when Kim says she is thankful for her sister, Emerald says they are not really sisters, explaining that Denise was brought to her as a baby. This causes Kim and Denise to reunite. After learning that Denise's friends know the identity of her son's biological father, Kim decides to find out the truth herself, concluding that Denise's former fianc\u00e9 Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the father. Kim confronts Ian but his wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) informs her that he has had a vasectomy so cannot father any more children. Denise eventually tells Kim that Phil is the father, which shocks Kim; Denise begs her not to tell anyone. When Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) suffers a cardiac arrest, Kim assists Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), who performs CPR. Kim is interviewed by a local radio station and plans to use the opportunity to advertise The Albert, but changes her mind after seeing Ian, who has lost his son and business in a fire.\n\nParagraph 27: Launching an assault in February 1918, the Third Army of the Ottoman Empire occupied Western Armenian settlements one after another. Following the failure of Trabzon peace talks in April, Third Army commander Mehmed Wehib Pasha moved his forces towards Transcaucasia. Taking advantage of the conciliatory policy of the leadership of the newly-proclaimed Transcaucasian Federative Republic, the Turkish military units captured the heavily fortified Castle of Kars on 25 April, thus creating a direct threat to Alexandrapol. Following the siege of Kars, the Ottoman Forces Command put forward new conditions to the Transcaucasian authorities, demanding the surrender of Akhalkalaki, Akhaltsikhe and Alexandrapol, as well as of Alexandropol\u2013Julfa railway, which the Turkish troops could use to reach Tabriz and get their hands on all the Transcaucasian railroads before the end of the war against the British. Unwilling to wait for the end of negotiations with the Transcaucasian delegation in Batumi, the Turkish forces took Alexandropol with a quick offensive on 15 May, creating a threat of conquest for all of Eastern Armenia. At this point, only a small area of Armenian territory remained unconquered by the Turks, and into that small area, hundreds of thousands of Armenian refugees fled. It seemed like it was only a matter of time until that too would be overrun.\n\nParagraph 28: Brian Field quickly became successful in both his personal and professional lives, he married a pretty German girl named Karin and rose to be a solicitor's managing clerk for John Wheater & Co. Despite the fact that he was only 28 at the time of the robbery, he was already much more successful than his boss, John Wheater. Field drove a new Jaguar and had a house he called \"Kabri\" (an amalgam of Karin and Brian) with his wife at the Bridle Path, Whitchurch Hill, Oxfordshire, near Pangbourne, while his boss owned a battered Ford and lived in a rundown neighbourhood. Part of the reason for this is that Field was not averse to giving some of his less savoury clients good information on what some of his wealthier clients had in their country houses, making them prime targets for the thieves. Another key reason being that an honest solicitor was useless to a career criminal of that era. What was needed was a bent solicitor who could arrange for alibis and friendly witness statements and bribe police and witnesses. As the managing clerk at his law firm, Field was able to carry out these activities and encourage repeat business. On one occasion he described the contents and layout of a house near Weybridge where his wife Karin had once been a nanny to a couple of criminals that he represented at various times in his career, Gordon Goody and Buster Edwards. He had arranged Buster's defence when he had been caught with a stolen car, and later met Goody at a nightclub in Soho. Field was then called upon to assist in the defence of Goody in the aftermath of the \"Airport Job\" which was a robbery carried out on 27 November 1962 at a branch of Barclays Bank at London Airport. This was the big practice robbery that the South West Gang had done prior to their grand scheme \u2013 the Great Train Robbery. Field was successful in arranging bail for Goody and Charlie Wilson.\n\nParagraph 29:  (2006) The gradual phasing out of the restored stainless steel Budd cars was to have taken place, with all departures in both directions to have been operated in favor of the more modern European-built Renaissance equipment. However, Via has had occasional problems with this equipment and has had to use the Budd cars. Work on upgrading the Renaissance fleet has resulted in the need to operate one Budd consist (with the two other consists Renaissance outfitted) during the winter season. This took place through to the winter of 2011/2012, and ended after the service was reduced to three trips a week, with the exception of extra Budd-equipped trains during the Christmas holidays in 2014 and 2015. A stainless steel Park Car (originally built in 1954) was attached to the end of every train for passengers in Easterly Class (named \"Sleeper Plus\"). Though initially available only during the peak summer season and the Christmas holidays, the Park car was part of every train year-round. The Renaissance cars' European couplers made it necessary to insert a barrier vehicle known as a transition car (numbered 7600\u20137602) between the Renaissance sleeping cars and the Park Car (or other Budd HEP cars). The transition car is converted from a Renaissance sleeper shell and is effectively an empty walk-through corridor with carpeted floor and handrails along the walls.\n\nParagraph 30: Ahmed Shah I laid the foundation of Bhadra Fort starting from Manek Burj, the first bastion of the city in 1411 which was completed in 1413. He also established the first square of the city, Manek Chowk, both associated with the legend of Hindu saint Maneknath. His Gujarat Sultanate (1411-1573) ruled from the city until 1484. His grandson Mahmud Begada transferred capital from Ahmedabad to Muhammadabad from 1484 to 1535 but carried out second fortification of the city. Later Ahmedabad again became capital of sultanate until it fell to Mughals in 1573. During Mughal rule (1572-1707), Bhadra Fort served as the seat of Governor of Gujarat. The city flourished with addition of several settlements in and around the city. Of the population of the city no estimate has been traced. There is some estimate of the size of city in works of the time: Ferishta, the Ain-i-Akbari, and the Mirat-i-Ahmadi. According to the Ain-i-Akbari (1580), there were 360 puras, of which only eighty-four were then flourishing; according to Ferishta there were, in 1600, 360 mahalla, each surrounded by a wall ; the Mirat-i-Ahmadi in one passage says, such was once its populous state that it contained 380 puras, each pura a considerable quarter almost a city; in another passage he mentions twelve city wards and others outside, and in his detailed account of the city he mentions by name 110 suburbs of which 19 were settled under Mughal rule. German traveller Mandelslo (1638) mentioned the suburbs and dependent villages are nearly seven leagues round. During Mughal and Maratha struggle (1707\u20131753) to control the city, the city was harmed and several suburbs were depopulated. The city walls damaged in battles and the trade was affected. The city revenue was divided between Mughal and Maratha rulers.  Later during Maratha rule (1758\u20131817), the city revenue was divided between Peshwa and Gaekwad. These affected the economy of the city due to more extraction of taxes. In 1817, Ahmedabad fell under British Company rule which stabilized the city politically and improved the trade. The population rose from 80,000 in 1817 to about 88,000 in 1824. During the eight following years a special cess was levied on ghee and other products and at a cost of \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000) the city walls were repaired. About the same time a cantonment was established on a site to the north of the city. The population rose (1816) to about 95,000. The remaining public funds  after the walls were finished were used for municipal purposes. The old city continued to be the centre of political activities during the Indian independence movement under Mahatma Gandhi.", "answers": ["Paragraph 17"], "pred": "2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,", "length": 9273, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4349c909bd2d20abdf107f11c32c821992e085f79e9de5bd"}
{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: This is a list of cricketers who have captained the West Indian U-19 cricket team for at least one U-19 One Day International. The table of results is complete to the sixth and final youth ODI match for the WI U-19 in the 2022 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup, and includes all six youth ODI match for the WI U-19 in the 2021 West Indies Under-19 tour of England, all six youth ODI match for the WI U-19 team in the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, all six youth ODI match for the WI U-19 team in the 2019 Under-19 Tri-Nation Tournament in the West Indies, all six youth ODI matches for the WI U-19 team in 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, all three youth ODI match for the WI U-19 team in the 2017 West Indies Under-19 tour of Zimbabwe, all five matches for the WI U-19 team in the 2017 West Indies Under-19 tour of South Africa, all six matches for the WI U-19 team of the 2016 U-19 Cricket World Cup, all three matches for the WI U-19 team of 2015/2016 West Indies U-19 tour of Bangladesh, all six matches for the WI U-19 team of the 2014 U-19 Cricket World Cup, the one and only youth ODI match of the 2013/2014 West Indies U-19 tour of Bangladesh (the other six matches were cancelled following an explosion near the WI U-19 team hotel), all seven youth ODI matches of the 2013/2014 Bangladesh U-19 tour of the West Indies, the 2012 U-19 Cricket World Cup (all six matches including the fifth place playoff), all seven youth ODI matches for the West Indies U-19 team in the 2011/12 U-19 Quadrangular Series in India, all three youth ODI matches of the 2011 Dubai Series between the West Indies U-19 team and the Australia U-19 team and all six matches of the West Indies team in the 2009/10 U-19 Cricket World Cup where they lost in the semi-finals to the Pakistan U-19 cricket team but beat the Sri Lanka U-19 cricket team in the playoff to place third in the tournament. West Indies U-19s' best result in an U-19 World Cup has been as champions in 2016. Previously they were a finalist in 2003/04 and 2007/08 they won the plate final for the U-19 World Cup.\n\nParagraph 2: Bob (played by Charlie Stewart) \u2013 One of the boys' best friends. He is a dyslexic. Zack meets him in school one day when he was moved into a regular class from a special education class because he was doing so well in it. He likes to play Total World Conquest with the boys and Cody's friends, Warren and Jeremy, though they almost never finish their games because Zack and Cody usually end up fighting. Bob, as shown in \"Smart & Smarteree\" and \"Odd Couples\", is somewhat impatient. He speaks fluent French, as illustrated in the episode \"French 101\". In the episode, \"Back in the Game\", one of his beliefs is frequent, short naps. In \"Forever Plaid\", he states that his favourite subject is Science. Bob is shown to also be talented in well-made creating a very well made rocking chair. He has a sister, possibly his twin, as shown in \"Election\", and a younger brother mentioned in \"Twins at the Tipton\". Bob likes to visits Zack and Cody just because the doorman calls him \"sir\". He was Puck in the show's version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, is on their basketball team and worked at the boys' club seen in \"Club Twin\" selling soda. Bob is very vulnerable to poison oak, shown in the episode \"Ah! Wilderness\". In the episode \"Super Twins\", he is the first and only child to be adultified by the Meanager (Moseby) \u2013 which causes the twins remark later that he has a booming insurance business. However, this is dropped when Zack turns back time at the end of episode. Bob is Zack and Cody's most frequent friend featured on the show with 16 appearances. He visits Zack and Cody on the SS Tipton once in The Suite Life on Deck, which reveals he is now dating Cody's ex-girlfriend Barbara.\n\nParagraph 3: Concurrently, the Turkish mercenaries had drained the treasury; many of the works of art and valuables of all sorts in the palace were sold to satisfy their demands---often they themselves were the purchasers, at merely nominal prices, and resold the articles thus gained at a profit. Emeralds valued at 300,000 dinars were bought by one Turkish general for 500 dinars, and in one fortnight of the year 460/1068 articles to the value of 30,000,000 dinars were sold off to provide pay for the Turks. The precious library, which had been rendered available to the public and was one of the attractions for many who visited Cairo, was scattered; the books were torn up, thrown away, or used to light fires. At length, the Turks began fighting amongst themselves. Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan, the general of the Turks, had invested the city, which was defended by the rival faction of the Turkish guard; after burning part of Fustat and defeating the defenders, he entered as conqueror. When he reached the palace, he found al-Mustansir lodged in rooms which had been stripped bare, waited on by only three slaves, and subsisting on two loaves which were sent him daily by the daughters of Ibn Babshand, the grammarian.\n\nParagraph 4: The Fort Lauderdale Strikers chose a much longer and bumpier path to the finals, a path that included three transcontinental trips. The Strikers qualified for the playoffs by virtue of a second-place finish in the Eastern Division of the American Conference with 163 points. Their opening round series was against the California Surf. The first leg was played on the West Coast in the 69,000 seat Anaheim Stadium before a pitiful crowd of 2,929 on August 28, 1980. Fort Lauderdale won that evening, 2\u20131. The return leg was played at Lockhart Stadium on August 31, 1980, before 15,282 Striker Likers. The Surf proved to be a worthy opponent, winning, 2\u20130, to send the series to a mini-game. After a scoreless 30 minutes, the teams moved on to an NASL shoot-out. The shoot-out went a then-record, 11 rounds, before Gerd M\u00fcller's second goal of the tie breaker won it for the Strikers by a 3\u20132 margin. In the conference semifinal series they headed west again, this time to face the Edmonton Drillers, who had themselves won the Western Division. Once again, Ft. Lauderdale took game 1 on the road at Commonwealth Stadium, this time by a score of 1\u20130 on September 3, 1980. Game 2 in South Florida saw the Drillers battle to a 2\u20132, 90 minute draw that went scoreless through 15 minutes of golden goal extra time. On to a shoot-out they went. Edmonton won the shoot-out battle, 2\u20131, to tie the series and a force mini-game, but they would not win the war. The home team posted a convincing, 3\u20130, victory in the 30-minute extra session to secure their second trip to the American Conference Finals in three years. The Strikers seemed destined to rack up a record number of frequent flyer miles at this point, as they got word that the wildcard San Diego Sockers had upset their cross-state rival Tampa Bay Rowdies that same evening. This of course meant another grueling West Coast trip, instead of the easy voyage across the state for a post-season edition of the Florida Derby. Moreover, the Sockers were now coached by Ron Newman. The Strikers had fired him at the end of the 1979 season after three years, despite his being the NASL's all-time winningest coach and leading the club to the playoffs in all three seasons. As if by a scrip and just as in the two previous series, Ft. Lauderdale won the first leg on the road by one goal, 2\u20131, at Jack Murphy Stadium on September 11, 1980. When the teams played the return leg two days later at Lockhart Stadium, once again the Strikers fell, this time by a 4\u20132 scoreline. Another convincing, 3\u20130, victory in yet another mini-game tie breaker secured them their first ever trip to the Soccer Bowl.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1266 Baraq was dispatched to Central Asia to take the throne of Chagatai. Kublai instigated Baraq to attack Kaidu in 1268. At first Baraq defeated Kaidu, however, the former was defeated by the latter with the assistance of M\u00f6ngke-Tem\u00fcr, successor of Berke. When Baraq advanced towards Kaidu, the latter set a trap for the invader's troops on the bank of the Jaxartes, and defeated his forces. Transoxiana was then ravaged by Kaidu. Baraq fled to Samarkand, then Bukhara, plundering the cities along the way in an attempt to rebuild his army. These actions alarmed Kaidu, who did not want the region to be further devastated. Kaidu also needed to free up his army for a potential conflict with Kublai. Peace was therefore proposed, and Baraq was pressured by the governors of the sedentary areas of the khanate, Mas'ud Beg and Daifu, to accept. He did, and peace was declared, although sources conflict on the time and location. Rashid al-Din claims that the meeting took place in the spring of 1269 in Talas, while Wassaf writes that it took place around 1267 to the south of Samarkand. Either way, two-thirds of Transoxiana were granted to Baraq, while the other third went to Kaidu and Mengu-Timur. Kaidu also gained control of the region around Bukhara. Neither side gained control of the cities; the administration of these instead devolved to Mas'ud Beg, while Baraq and Kaidu agreed to reside only in the deserts and mountains.\n\nParagraph 6: When Togo was 8 months old, he proved his worth as a sled dog. Seppala had been hired by a client to transport him quickly to a newly discovered gold claim which would be an overnight round trip for the team. Unable to spare extra time dealing with the young Togo's antics, Seppala tethered him inside the kennel with instructions left to not let him free until he and the team were well and gone. A short while after Seppala had left, Togo broke free of the tether and jumped the kennel fence, getting his paw caught in the process. A kennel handler noticed and cut the dog down from the fencing, but before he could grab him, Togo took off to follow the team's trail. He followed them through nightfall and slept, unnoticed, near the cabin where Seppala was spending the night. The next day, Seppala spotted him far off in the distance, and understood why his dogs had been so keyed up. Togo continued to make Seppala's work difficult on the return trip to the kennel, trying to play with the work dogs and leading them in \"charges against reindeer\", pulling them off the trail. Seppala had no choice but to put him in a harness to control him, and was surprised that Togo instantly settled down. As the run wore on, Seppala kept moving Togo up the line until, at the end of the day, he was sharing the lead position with the lead dog (named \"Russky\"). Togo had logged 75 miles on his first day in harness, which was unheard of for an inexperienced young sled dog, especially a puppy. Seppala called him an \"infant prodigy\", and later added that \"I had found a natural-born leader, something I had tried for years to breed.\"\n\nParagraph 7: In 2014 the Terra Submersa team, led by Julien Beck, was waiting for permission to conduct their survey of the Franchthi area of Kiladha Bay. To bide their time they ran some training dives several hundred metres north, just outside the mouth of the Bay, at Lambayanna Beach.  These dives revealed very old pottery fragments and odd seafloor anomalies that piqued their interest.  Returning in 2015 for a more thorough investigation, they found the ruins of an Early Bronze Age city. The site spans  and lies beneath  of water. It includes the foundations of buildings, stone paved surfaces that are likely roads, and what appear to be the remains of a fortification wall with three large towers.  Such a defensive structure would be the first of its kind to be discovered from the Early Bronze Age in Greece. The visible remains of Lambayanna are dated to the Early Helladic II era (c. 2650 \u2013 c. 2200 BC), making it a contemporary of the House of the Tiles at Lerna, the building of the Great Pyramids, and both the Cycladic and Minoan cultures of the nearby Aegean islands. A second layer of Lambayanna has been identified as Early Helladic I (c. 3200 \u2013 c. 2650 BC), and a third layer has revealed pottery that dates all the way back to an intermediary period between the Bronze Age and the Neolithic, suggesting not only that the site is well over 5,000 years old, but that it may have had an overlapping relationship with the Neolithic Franchthi community.\n\nParagraph 8: Pittas started playing football as an amateur at GS Patision in 1974. He won the local championship and he also became an international with the youth team in 1976. Two years later he moved to Korinthos, where he played for three seasons and  in 1979 he won the second division at their group, as well as the promotion to the first division. In 1981 he moved to Ethnikos Piraeus, where he played for four seasons and his performances attracted the interest of the big clubs. In 1985, Pittas was transferred to the PAOK and played at the club of Thessaloniki until December 1986. In December of 1986, Pittas moved to AEK Athens and performed quite well, helping the team with his good technique and strong shot. On 24 January 1988, in a match against PAOK and while the score was at 0\u20130, at the 30th minute AEK won an indirect foul from quite a long distance and Pittas had not seen the gesture of the referee for an indirect foul, he executed directly with the ball hitting the goalkeeper's hand and ending up in the net. If the goalkeeper had let the ball go straight to the net, the goal would not count. PAOK objected, asking for the replay of the match but,  the objection fell on deaf ears. As he revealed, when the players and the referee were returning after the goal for the continuation of the match, the referee angrily addressed him and asking him if he was trying to end his refereeing career. On 7 September 1988, he scored the winner with a header against Athletic Bilbao for the UEFA Cup. He distinguished himself quite a bit in the yellow-blacks, actively participating in winning the league in 1989. An interesting story of that time is that he won a bet of 500,000 drachmas from his teammate Stelios Manolas, betting that AEK would win the championship in the end of the season, where Manolas did not expect that AEK would succeed and naturally lost the bet. He left AEK in 1989 in a bad way, having complaints mainly from the president of the club, Stratos Gidopoulos, as well as the manager, Du\u0161an Bajevi\u0107, since his contract was not renewed and at the same time the management owed him money, making an appeal and staying out of matches for a long time. He then played for 3 seasons in the second division with E.A. Rethymniakou, before ending his career in 1992.\n\nParagraph 9: The first hour of the race saw Toyota Gazoo Racing lead the race with a 1-2, after being split by Rebellion Racing\u2019s Bruno Senna early on. Senna had initially led Kamui Kobayashi in the #7 Toyota for the first 20 minutes, after an opportunistic lunge into Turn 3, successfully holding Kobayashi behind, in the Silverstone-winning Toyota, which had been slapped with a 1.4-second success handicap. The battle between the #1 Rebellion and the #7 Toyota saw Kobayashi repeatedly accelerate past Senna heading onto the long main straight at Fuji Speedway, only for the Rebellion to draft past the Toyota with its higher top-end speed, towards the end of the straight. The battle cost both drivers time against the sister #8 Toyota of S\u00e9bastien Buemi, who built up a clear advantage in the opening stint, ending hour 1 23 seconds ahead of Kobayashi. The #5 Team LNT Ginetta trailed the duelling pair by 20 seconds, with Egor Orudzhev having made a good start, briefly moving up to second with a sweeping move around Senna and Kobayashi into Turn 1, but eventually lost ground in the following corners to the pair. In LMP2, Giedo van der Garde made a swift charge to put the Racing Team Nederland Oreca 07 Gibson into the class lead, from 7th of the 8 LMP2s on the starting grid, eventually holding a commanding 23 second lead over the 2nd placed High Class Racing car. GTE-Pro saw three changes of the lead in the 1st hour, with pole-sitter Gianmaria Bruni being overtaken by Alessandro Pier Guidi in the #51 Ferrari on lap one, only for Bruni to return to the place once more, diving underneath the Italian into Turn 1 half an hour in, with Marco Sorensen putting the No. 95 Aston Martin Vantage GTE out front later on. Before the first round of pit stops took place, Sorensen led Bruni by less than a second, while Maxime Martin was third in the sister Aston Martin, ahead of Bruni\u2019s teammate Kevin Estre and the two AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE Evos. Salih Yoluc, and the TF Sport Team dominated the opening hour in GTE-Am, with the #90 TF Sport Aston Martin driver working his way into a near half-minute lead. The class triggered a safety car on the first lap, when Satoshi Hoshino careered into the side of the No. 98 Aston Martin Vantage driven by Paul Dalla Lana, at the chicane.\n\nParagraph 10: The main mountainous islands of Scotland are Skye, Mull and R\u00f9m in the Inner Hebrides and Harris within the Outer Hebrides, however Islay, Jura and, although separated from the Hebrides, Arran are all very well-regarded for their hills and mountains. Skye's Black Cuillin, composed of basalt and rough gabbro, is generally regarded as the most serious mountain terrain in Britain with bare rock, jagged in outline and steep cliffs and deep cut corries. Ropes are required for some summits and the area is host to the only Munro necessitating climbing apparatus, the In Pinn. The neighbouring Red Cuillin is composed primarily of granite and has more isolated, cone-shaped mountains of a slightly lesser height. Skye is also very well known for the Quiraing and its Old Man of Storr on the Trotternish peninsula. The isle of R\u00f9m has its own Cuillin, also composed of gabbro but shorter, grassier; necessitating good scrambling ability, and a head for heights. Multiple characteristic smaller hills are to be found on the island as well. Although only having one Munro, Ben More, Mull is a very mountainous island in its centre with Grahams and lower hills. The walking here is not as precipitous as the latter but still requires good competence. Jura is best known by the Paps of Jura, three cone-shaped, quartzite hills which are home to the Isle of Jura Fell Race and necessitate a great deal of height gain despite their size. Smaller hills are to be found nearby to them and on the remote northern half of the island. Within the Outer Hebrides, the mountains of Harris dominate, providing a stark contrast to the flatness of Lewis. The four highest mountains here are separated from each other by deep valleys, however the areas highest mountain, An Cliseam, can be climbed via a short horseshoe route. South Uist, further south in the archipelago, also has small enjoyable mountains and hills. The final island of considerable concern is Arran, which has four Corbetts and one Graham. These mountains require considerable care in places and include the A'Chir ridge, an area well-regarded by climbers; a number of approaches and routes are possible, usually starting from Glen Rosa or Glen Sannox. The St. Kilda archipelago, 40-miles west-northwest of North Uist, is also worth mentioning, consisting of four exceptionally steep-sided islands and multiple sea stacks, all but one requiring special planning and authorisation to visit and almost all necessitating safety ropes. These islands are sought after by hill baggers. Scotland also has smaller islands with conspicuous summits not part of a range, such as D\u00f9n Caan on Raasay. The highest point of this area is Sg\u00f9rr Alasdair.\n\nParagraph 11: Johnstone attempted to place much of the blame for his delay in chasing the French on a subordinate, Captain Evelyn Sutton of HMS Isis, and deprived him of his command and substantial prize money. Sutton was arrested and court-martialed, but acquitted. In response Sutton brought a suit against his former commander. Johnstone had to contest this suit, protracted by appeals, for the rest of his life, with it only being settled in his favour two days before his death. Johnstone was by now probably suffering from Hodgkin's disease, which may have been responsible for some of his lapses in judgement. He was elected as member of parliament for Lostwithiel in 1781, and continued to be an active member, opposing American independence, and government interference in the running of the East India Company. He opposed Charles James Fox's proposals for tighter controls on the company, but in a move contrary to his earlier views, supported William Pitt the Younger's scheme. Pitt's was more moderate than Fox's, allowing the Company directors to retain power over company appointments, and Johnstone may have made a deal with Pitt to support this measure in exchange for Pitt's supporting Johnstone's bid to be elected to the directorship of the company, which he achieved in 1784. The two did not collaborate closely after this, and Pitt neither brought him into his government, nor offered him a pocket borough to represent in the 1784 general election. Johnstone instead attempted to win the seat of Haddington Burghs, but was defeated. He contested Ilchester the following year, but was again defeated. After a petition however his opponent John Harcourt was declared not to have been elected, and Johnstone was elected in his stead. By now in poor health Johnstone remained only a year in Parliament, before applying for Chiltern Hundreds in 1787 to resign his seat.\n\nParagraph 12: The command of what was now called the XI Corps changed to Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard in 1863, and Steinwehr continued to command the division in the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of Gettysburg.  The corps was the victim of the surprise flanking attack by Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, and the overwhelming attack by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps on the first day of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863.  At Chancellorsville, Steinwehr's division had one brigade, that of Col Adolphus Buschbeck involved in resisting Jackson's attack. At Gettysburg, when the corps was forced to retreat back through the town to Cemetery Hill, Col Charles Coster took a brigade of Steinwehr's division out to the edge of the town, where it sacrificed itself buying time for the retreating soldiers of the other two divisions. These two defeats seriously degraded the combat effectiveness of the XI Corps and humiliated many of the German immigrant soldiers in the corps. Nevertheless, Steinwehr was well thought of by his superiors. After Chancellorsville, General Howard wrote that Steinwehr's bearing during the battle was \"cool, collected and judicious.\" Brig. Gen. Alpheus Williams, a fellow division commander, described him as a \"remarkably intelligent and agreeable person.\"\n\nParagraph 13: During his attempts to establish the truth, Sathyam faces various troubles. The Minister's proxies give him various troubles by killing children by offering them ice creams laced with drugs to eat and killing his mother. When Sathyam arrests Acharya, the Minister's proxy, and takes him to court, the Minister's henchmen attack him while driving and Sathyam is stabbed. Thillanayagam (Dilli Babu in Telugu version), the other proxy, shoots Acharya and blames Sathyam. Sathyam performs his mother's funeral rites and is suspended from the force and jailed. Manicka Vel, to be released the next day, feels sad for Sathyam and laments his loss in the jail. Thillanayagam runs for MLA with the Minister's support so that he cannot be harmed by Sathyam. He gloats to Sathyam at the jail about his newfound power and challenges Sathyam's honor and dignity. At a public rally for Thillanayagam's candidature, the Kondal Dasan openly challenges and insults Sathyam, who is released from jail by a sympathetic officer and coming to disrupt the public rally. Manicka Vel stands in the corner aiming to kill Thillanayagam and the Dasan. Sathyam arrives and exposes the Minister and Thillanayagam by shooting them and forcing them to confess the truth about the Minister's intentions and the death of the proxy. Thillanayagam reveals everything about himself, Acharya, and Dasan. While lamenting the situation he is in and calling for reform, Sathyam is shot by the Minister's henchman and questions the honesty and trust his people and fellow officers have in him. Manicka Vel arrives on the scene and salutes Sathyam, with other officers following suit. A newscast is shown with Kondal Dasan and Thillanayagam being arrested and Sathyam is reinstated in the police force. Sathyam is promoted to Deputy Commissioner by the Chief Minister and marries Deivanayaki, and the credits roll.\n\nParagraph 14: Magnetotactic crystals range anywhere in size from 30 nanometers to 120 nanometers. This size allows them to be magnetically stable and to help optimize the MTB ability toward magnetotaxis. The single domain crystals have the maximum possible magnetic moment per unit volume for a given composition. A smaller size would not be as efficient to contribute to the cellular magnetic moment, the smaller size crystals are superparamagnetic, therefore they are not continuously magnetic. Crystals exceeding 120 nanometers can form magnetic domains in opposition to the desired direction. While a single magnetosome chain could appear to be ideal for magneto-aerotaxis, a number of magnetotactic bacteria have magnetosomes or magnetosome arrangements that depart from the ideal. A reported example includes large magnetosomes (up to 200 nanometers) found in coccoid cells in Brazil. These cells contain enough magnetosomes that the calculated magnetic dipole moment of the cell is about 250 times larger than that of a typical Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum. Some bacteria have magnetosomes that are not arranged in chains, but the magnetosomes are clustered on one side of the cell. In this arrangement, the shape anisotropy of each crystal provides the stability against remagnetization, rather than the overall shape anisotropy in the magnetosome chain arrangement. These non-ideal arrangements may lead to additional, currently unknown functions of magnetosomes; possibly related to metabolism.\n\nParagraph 15: Upskilling : This category is based on a human capital investment approach, which aims to adapt workers' skills to labour market requirements through measures that may take the form of state-subsidised classes and apprenticeships helping the unemployed improve their vocational skills as a way to promote access to the labour market for workers with outdated skills or from certain disadvantaged groups such as early school leavers with few qualifications.                                                                                                                               It is widely applied in the Nordic countries and particularly in Denmark where it forms the core of the flexi security model which focuses on the empowerment of jobseekers by funding extensive training programmes which are accessible or even compulsory after one year of unemployment. The provision of basic education services can also play a role in improving human capital for certain categories such as recently arrived immigrant workers, Germany thus provided in the past few years German language skills courses that concerned 170 000 people, most asylum seekers in 2017 with efforts made to involve them into preparatory traineeship, These measures have had\u00a0 the effect of increasing their productivity, reflected in the fact that immigrants with good German writing skills see their wage gap with natives reduced by 10%\n\nParagraph 16: Upon its completion, the span became part of the Lincoln Highway. This historic transcontinental roadway's original alignment, like the Transcontinental Railroad that preceded it nearly sixty years earlier, chose to avoid crossing the Carquinez Strait entirely. The preferred option, given the engineering limitations of the day, was to skirt around the Delta by going south from Sacramento through Stockton, then proceeding west across the San Joaquin River and over the Altamont Pass, and finally reaching Oakland from the south; a route that would later become U.S. Route 50 and ultimately Interstates 5, 205, and 580. This circuitous route, several miles longer, and traversing a rather formidable mountain pass, was preferable to crossing the Carquinez Strait, a deep channel with strong currents and frequent high winds. For decades, building a bridge across the Carquinez Strait was considered prohibitively expensive and technologically risky. Once the bridge was built however, driving from Sacramento to the East Bay became much more direct. The Carquinez Bridge provided a welcome alternative route from the Central Valley to the Bay Area, one that no longer required loading one's vehicle onto and off of a ferry. With the bridge completed, the Lincoln Highway was realigned to cross the Sacramento River, then proceed southwest through Davis and Vallejo, across the Carquinez Bridge, and along the shores of the San Pablo and San Francisco bays to Richmond and Oakland; becoming U.S. Route 40, and ultimately Interstate 80.\n\nParagraph 17: In the late 19th century Fall River, Massachusetts, together with Kearny, New Jersey and St. Louis, Missouri, emerged as a stronghold for soccer in the United States. In the late 1870s Fall River experienced a period of economic growth, driven by the demand for cotton print cloth. Southeastern New England was the birthplace of the United States textile industry and Fall River became known as Spindle City. By 1876 the city was home to 43 factories, more than 30,000 looms and more than one million spindles. Keeping them all working required immigrant labor and, while some of the new arrivals were French Canadian and Irish, many also came from Lancashire and Glasgow, two of the earliest strongholds of soccer in the United Kingdom.  As a result, several soccer clubs, including Rovers, emerged within the city. In February 1884, the team was founded at a meeting held on County Street, Fall River.  The team joined the Bristol County Football Association in 1885.  Other clubs from the city included Fall River Olympics, Fall River Pan Americans and Fall River East Ends. Rovers, along with these clubs became affiliated with the American Football Association and entered the American Cup. Between 1888 and 1892 teams from Fall River won the cup five times in succession. Fall River Rovers won it in both 1888 and 1889. In 1891, Rovers, along with the Fall River Olympics, East Enders and Pawtucket Free Wanderers, formed the New England League. In 1903, Rovers won the Interstate League championship.  In 1907, they reentered the AFA.  The Rovers were the New England League champions in 1909 before joining the first Eastern Soccer League in 1910. When this league was abandoned during its only season, Rovers were in the lead. Between 1915 and 1921 they played in the Southern New England Soccer League, twice finishing as runners-up in 1917 and 1921. In 1917 they also won the Times Cup, the league cup of the SNESL, defeating J&P Coats 3\u20130 in the final.\n\nParagraph 18: \"6 Underground\" is a song by the English band Sneaker Pimps from their debut studio album Becoming X. First released as a single in the United Kingdom in September 1996, the song reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart and had moderate radio airplay in the United States, where it was shipped to modern rock and dance stations in February 1997. After the song was used in the 1997 American film The Saint, radio stations began playing \"6 Underground\" more frequently. The single was re-released in May 1997, when it peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart. In the United States, the song peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number seven on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nParagraph 19: On 1 August 2016, U.S. crewed and uncrewed aircraft carried out airstrikes on ISIL targets in Libya, responding to the U.N.-backed government's request to help push the militants from their former stronghold of Sirte (where several hundred ISIL fighters remained), in what U.S. officials described as the start of a sustained campaign against the extremist group in the city. President Barack Obama authorized the airstrikes after a recommendation by U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter; the strikes hit an ISIL tank and two vehicles that posed a threat to forces aligned with Libyan GNA (Government of National Accord). This was the third U.S. air strike against ISIL militants in Libya, but this time U.S. officials said it marked the start of a sustained air campaign rather than another isolated strike, U.S. airstrikes would continue to target ISIL in Sirte in order to enable the GNA to make a decisive, strategic advance. United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) oversaw the US effort, which was known as Operation Odyssey Lightning. AV-8B Harrier IIs assigned to the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (22nd MEU) flying off  conducted the airstrikes and uncrewed aircraft launched from undisclosed locations. Airstrikes continued, on 2 August, airstrikes hit a rocket launcher, an excavator and a pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle and on 3 August airstrikes struck a pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle; by 9 August the U.S. conducted 28 strikes against ISIL in Libya, with more than half of the strikes being conducted from uncrewed aircraft. By 16 August, U.S. airstrikes hit an ISIL vehicle and 4 militant positions in Sirte, bringing the number of U.S. airstrikes in Libya to 48. On 17 August, U.S. Africa Command officials announced on 16 August airstrikes on ISIL targets in Sirte struck 7 enemy fighting positions, 4 vehicle-borne bombs, 1 pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle, 12 enemy fighting positions and 1 command-and-control vehicle, bringing the total number of airstrikes in support of Operation Odyssey Lightning to 57. On 22 August, Stars and Stripes reported that U.S. Marine AH-1W SuperCobra helicopters participated in strikes against ISIL militants in Sirte on 20 and 21 August; a small detachment of U.S. special forces in Sirte provided most of the targeting information for the airstrikes which were then relayed to U.S. forces through Libyan government troops. On 31 August, Stars and Stripes reported that the U.S. military conducted 104 airstrikes against ISIL targets in Libya in August.\n\nParagraph 20: The relationship between theology and philosophy has been long-debated and discussed with the Christian tradition. Tertullian, an influential early Christian theologian and apologist, believed that philosophy has little to do with theology, arguing that the use of philosophy often corrupted theology, leading to unorthodox beliefs that were not grounded in the early Christian tradition. He famously asked the question 'What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?'. (Athens symbolized the philosophical approach because of its role as a leading center of Hellenistic philosophy, while Jerusalem represented Christianity because of its role as an important location and intellectual centre in the early church.) Other leaders, however, saw a closer relationship between philosophy and theology. Justin Martyr looked at people like Heraclitus and Socrates as possessing the divine light of revelation and believed them to be true philosophers. Justin saw Christianity as the True Philosophy and argued for Christianity using philosophical methods and terminology. St. Augustine, who became one of the most influential theologians in history and whose works laid the foundation for much of Western philosophy (as well as much of Western theology), espoused a more middle-of-the-road, moderate approach, arguing that philosophy and theology often complement each other while at the same time cautioning that philosophy should not always be used in theological discourse. Instead, he argued, one should make sure that a philosophical approach toward a particular issue was grounded in prior Christian commitments.\n\nParagraph 21: Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Dub\u00e9 began playing piano at the age of 3 and played in public at age 4. A child prodigy, he won a Steinway piano at the age of 9 during the national competition \"Jeunes Prodiges Mozart \u00e0  Paris\". The same year, he played as a soloist at the Maison de la Radio with the Radio France Philharmonic Orchestra, live on France Musique. His discography already includes thirty recordings including twenty CDs, especially with  Syrius, Bnl and Naxos labels  in addition to several DVDs of concertos for French television and other foreign radio and television networks. Very comfortable in all repertoires, including those for the  left hand alone, he is one of the few pianists in the world able to play Ligeti's piano concerto and to give in a single recital the \"Vingts Regards sur l\u2019Enfant J\u00e9sus \"of Messiaen. He likes to associate other arts with music (painting, sculpture, cinema, literature) and give themed recitals (bells, birds, love, dance, water and gardens ...). His interpretation of the Turangal\u00eel\u00e2 was the best show of the year in 2000 in Riga and that of Liszt's 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody won in 2002 the fastest replay in the history of Radio Chicago (WFMT station).Unanimous  First Prize of the National Conservatory of Paris( Perfectionnement) at  the age of 14 under Jacques Rouvier, he studied with Jacqueline Robin, Catherine Collard and with John O'Conor in Dublin, thanks to a full year Yvonne Lef\u00e9bure scholarship. Winner of the European Piano Competition Ouistreham Riva 2009, which also awarded him the Chopin Association Prize in Nohant, he also won the First Grand Prix unanimously and the Public Prize at the Franz Liszt Competition in Utrecht 2002 as well as other international competitions (Francis Poulenc, Bucharest, Messiaen, Bourse Yvonne Lef\u00e9bure Orl\u00e9ans XXth Century). Invited as a member of the jury of international competitions (Pinerolo 2004, Poulenc 2008, Chang Chun 2009, Franz Liszt Utrecht 2019), he also gives master classes (Finland, Hungary, Netherlands, Ecuador, Ethiopia, South Africa, China, Malta ...). He plays on all continents as a soloist, chamber music groups and with many large orchestras. He has just recorded the Liszt Sonata in addition to  a CD dedicated to  Native American Indian music for the Syrius label. He collaborates on a  regular basis with Julia Le Brun, ( a lecturer and opera specialist, www.levoyagelyrique.com)and is one of the Concertino artistic directors.

At the beginning of this period, when the United States was just emerging from its colonial past, the agricultural landscape of New England was defined overwhelmingly by subsistence farming.  The primary crops produced were wheat, barley, rye, oats, turnips, parsnips, carrots, onions, cucumbers, beets, corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes, and melons.  Because there was not a sufficiently large New England-based home market for agricultural products due to the absence of a large nonagricultural population, New England farmers, by and large, had no incentive to commercialize their farms.  Thus, as farmers could not find very many markets nearby to sell to, they generally could not earn enough income with which to buy many new products for themselves. This not only meant that farmers would largely produce their own food, but also that they tended to produce their own furniture, clothing, and soap, among other household items.  Hence, according to historian Percy Bidwell, at the onset of the early national period, much of the New England agricultural economy was characterized by a \u201clack of exchange; lack of differentiation of employments or division of labor; the absence of progress in agricultural methods; a relatively low standard of living; emigration and social stagnation.\u201d  As Bidwell writes, the farming in New England at this time was \u201cpractically uniform\u201d with many farmers distributing their land \u201cin about the same proportions into pasturage, woodland, and tillage, and raised about the same crops and kept about the same kind and quantity of stock\u201d as other farmers.  This situation would, however, be radically different by 1850, by which time a highly specialized agricultural economy producing a host of new and differentiated products had emerged. Two factors were primarily responsible for the revolutionary changes in the agricultural economy of New England during the period from 1790 to 1850: (1) The rise of the manufacturing industry in New England (industrialization), and (2) agricultural competition from the western states.\n\nParagraph 23: Hanson's best-known work is Patterns of Discovery (1958), in which he argues that what we see and perceive is not what our senses receive, but is instead filtered sensory information, where the filter is our existing preconceptions \u2013 a concept later called a 'thematic framework.' He cited optical illusions such as the famous old Parisienne woman (Patterns of Discovery, p.\u00a011), which can be seen in different ways. Hanson drew a distinction between 'seeing as' and 'seeing that' which became a key idea in evolving theories of perception and meaning. He wanted to formulate a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used Charles Sanders Peirce's notion of abduction for this.\n\nParagraph 24: HMAS Maroubra (FY.40/MR) was an auxiliary powered cutter built for Hayles Magnetic Island Pty Ltd of Townsville. She was built for the Northern Territory coastal trade, and launched in 1930 by Norman Wright in Brisbane. She sailed from Townsville for Darwin in July 1930 via Cooktown and Thursday Island, where her skipper for the first leg, Captain R Hall handed her over to Captain Henry Lawson. Maroubra reached Darwin at 3 am on 25July. Captain Lawson formerly of the State Shipping Service, reported very stormy weather outside much rougher than was usually expected at that time of the year. During the trip the future operator of the vessel, and family member Jack Hayles, crushed his fingers badly in attending to the engine, and has had to have three fingers amputated, the accident was due to the unusually rough weather. Maroubra was the third vessel used by Hayles Magnetic Island Ltd in the shipping contract from Darwin to the Victoria and the Daly Rivers, and replaced Maree which, in turn replaced Magneta. With the threat of war looming Maroubra was chartered by the Australian Petroleum Company Ltd in January 1938 to convey about 4,500 gallons of aviation fuel to bases established for the patrol boat Larrakia in Arnhem Land. The petrol was held in readiness at Golburn Islands, Mllingimbi, Elcho Island and Yirkalla. Maroubra was the largest boat trading along the northern coast and was usually engaged chiefly in the transport of buffalo hides to Darwin from shooters camps on the banks of the larger rivers. No other boat in Darwin would hazard the long voyage to East Arnhem Land at that time of the year. At the same time she continued the work of supply and relief of police officers at their remote outposts.  Maroubra was requisitioned for the RAN, from Australian Petroleum, on 20 March 1942. She was commissioned as HMAS Maroubra on the 21 September 1942 for military service as a patrol boat, auxiliary minesweeper, diving and stores transporter; operating between the ports of Cairns, Townsville, Thursday Island and Darwin.  Under naval control her duties didn't change much, she still supplied the same remote outposts along with newly established military bases. On 10 May 1943 Maroubra was lying at Millingimbi in Arnhem Land when she was  strafed by nine Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters at Millingimbi, Northern Territory on 10 May 1943. She caught fire and sank or drifted ashore.\n\nParagraph 25: According to Spence, \"I received a phone call, in which NFL Films claimed my music had been 'stolen' and used in a pornographic film called Deep Throat (released on June 12, 1972 in the U.S.). They would send me a paper to sign to the effect that NFL Films was empowered to protect the music in a court of law. In all sincerity, I did not see a possible 'plot' here at all. However, I unwittingly 'punctured their balloon' by explaining that they didn't have to bother with this at all because GEMA (a German state-authorized performance rights organization) would protect my music and legally proceed after anyone who used it without permission.\" As Klein reported, \"soon afterwards, GEMA sent Spence a video copy of the film and asked him to make a list of \"where and how long\" his music appeared in it. Thus, the composer dutifully watched the film in order to find possible fragments of his music in it. Yet, the outcome was unexpected.\" In Spence's own words: \"I was surprised to find not one note of my music in the film. Na\u00efve, trusting person that I was, it never dawned on me it could possibly be a hoax to get me to sign a forthcoming document.\" According to Spence, \"the next 'trick' came several months later. I received a phone call in which I was told that NFL Films had a court case in two days against someone who had illegally used some of my music. Their lawyer had sent me a paper via Federal Express, which they said would be arriving shortly (in that same afternoon) for my signature. After signed, the FedEx courier would immediately send it back to them so they would have it in time for the court case.\" According to Klein's report, the composer received the paper in the afternoon and read it but, in Spence's words, \"after reading the paper, I called them and said that I could not sign a document with that wording. But they assured me that as soon as the case was over, they would send it back to me.\" Still unsuspecting, and trusting in the company's words, Spence signed the document and sent it to NFL Films. He never got the paper back and, to this day, the late composer's family is not receiving royalties for the many uses of Spence's music in American television shows and commercials.\n\nParagraph 26: For marching band, schools compete against other schools in the same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into nine areas (named A-I) for Conferences 5A and 6A, and five areas (A-E) for Conference 4A and down. All schools of all conferences compete in region and area competition annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Conferences 2A, 4A, and 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Conferences 3A and 5A can advance from region to area and state, in addition to schools in Conference 1A may advance from region to state (There are no Area contests for Conference 1A, only for 2A and up). In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, they need to get an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, whether it be a 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band needs to make it to the Area Final competition AND make it to the top 3 bands (or 20% of all participating area bands if 20 or more bands are competing) to get to State. The Area and State champion is the school with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.\n\nParagraph 27: In its heyday, Dalymount Park, or \"Dalyer\" as it is popularly known, regularly saw crowds of up to 40,000 for big games, however, whether it was ever able to accommodate this number of spectators safely is open to question. The stadium consisted of three sides of open terracing, one side the \"Shed End\" or \"School End\" being partly covered with a roof over half the terrace since 1945. The fourth side was the main stand, which held only 1500 seats. The stand was constructed in 1928 from iron and wood, with wooden benches and terraced standing room at the front. The floodlights that adorn Dalymount Park once thought to have stood at Arsenal's old stadium, were in fact built in Scotland. The lights were funded through what we would now refer to as crowd funding and inviting some of the bigger teams over. Initial notices suggested that the lights would be in place by September 1961, which was then extended to October and ultimately until February of 1962. In the words of Club Secretary Andy Kettle, as quoted by Ryan Clarke in his recent series on Dalymount, it also meant that Bohs could \u201cinvite many top clubs to Dublin from time to time\u201d.\n\nParagraph 28: Chapter 30, \"Toward a Theory of Strategy for Liberty\", argues that the quest to achieve liberty should be motivated by a conception of natural-rights justice, rather than utility. Rothbard discusses the strategic stance that a libertarian should take in a world where states still exist, and how to push society towards greater liberty. He argues that while the ultimate goal of the libertarian is the immediate abolition of the state as an organized engine of aggression, transitional demands and steps towards liberty in practice are necessary. However, these transitional demands should never contradict the ultimate goal of liberty. For example, a demand for a 10% reduction in the government budget each year for ten years, after which the government will disappear, may have heuristic or strategic value, but it should never imply that any faster pace towards cutting the budget would be wrong. Similarly, the idea of a comprehensive planned program towards liberty is flawed, as it implies that the state is not the enemy of mankind and that it is desirable to use the state to engineer a measured pace towards liberty. The insight that the state is the permanent enemy of mankind leads to a different strategic outlook, where libertarians push for and accept any reduction of state power or activity on any front. Rothbard argues that the reduction or abolition of a tax is always a non-contradictory reduction of state power and a step towards liberty, but its replacement by a new or increased tax elsewhere does just the opposite, for it signifies a new and additional imposition of the state on some other front. The imposition of a new tax is a means that contradicts the libertarian goal itself. Finally, Rothbard states that while the libertarian may set priorities and concentrate his energy on political issues that he deems most important, he must use his strategic intelligence and knowledge of the issues of the day to set his priorities of political importance.\n\nParagraph 29: The Swedish Army left Saxony on August 1707 to march east towards Russian territory. The army was largely newly recruited and well-equipped, numbering about 40,000 men. Rehnski\u00f6ld acted as Field Marshal and stood closest to the King at its high command. Rehnski\u00f6ld and the army command were unaware of Charles XII's plans for the campaign, which the King kept to himself, but agreed upon a preliminary march towards Russia's capital Moscow, where Peter I had gathered most of his forces. Charles XII ordered the commander of the \"Army of Courland\" in the Baltic provinces, General Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt, to join the main army in the march against Moscow. Lewenhaupt and the Army of Courland were also tasked with obtaining supplies and wagons for onward transport to the Swedish main army. Awaiting Lewenhaupt's troops, the main army advanced slowly towards the Russian border. At the end of January 1708, they arrived at Grodno, which was occupied by 9,000 men of Peter I's army. Charles XII and Rehnski\u00f6ld attacked with 800 cavalry units, and the Russian troops withdrew after a short but fierce battle. Later in the evening, Russian troops sneaked into the city to surprise the Swedes; Rehnski\u00f6ld ended up in the middle of the attacking troops, but was not recognized because of the dark sky and managed to get to safety. The attack was repelled, and the Russians were forced to retreat. Later in the year, during the crossing of the Vabitj River at the town of Holowczyn in July 1708, the Swedish vanguard encountered a Russian army in fortified positions on the opposite shore. In the battle of Holowczyn, Charles XII commanded the infantry while Rehnski\u00f6ld commanded the cavalry. The Russian troops under Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev and Prince Alexander Danilovich Menshikov were pushed back after eight hours of struggle; however the Russian Army managed to escape mostly intact so the battle was not a decisive strategic victory.\n\nParagraph 30: Totenkopf was initially held in reserve during the Battle of France and invasion of the Low Countries in May 1940. The division was committed on 16 May to the front in Belgium. Later, it was decided that Totenkopf would reinforce the breakthrough of Erwin Rommel\u2019s 7th Panzer Division in the Cambrai area. Reaching the Bazuel area straddling both sides of the river it arrived on the front on 19 May, facing elements of the French 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, 5th North African Infantry Division, and 9th Motorized Division. Totenkopf suffered 16 dead and 53 wounded while killing 200 Moroccan soldiers in its first day in action. In its first major battle it captured the town of Catillon-sur-Sambre and its associated canal in fierce house-to-house fighting, blocking the exits of the town and trapping the Moroccan force in the center around the market square, eventually captured thousands of remaining troops. Soldiers from Totenkopf executed many captured Moroccans, due to Arabs being considered \"racially inferior\". On the morning of the next day, May 20 it contained a major Moroccan counter attack near Ribeauville, driving it back with its own counter attack, before crossing the Selle river and linking up with Rommel\u2019s division in the outskirts of Cambrai. Overall in the actions around the Cambrai/Sambre area the division captured 16,000 troops.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text discusses the size and arrangement of magnetotactic crystals, which are crystals found in bacteria that allow them to orient themselves according to Earth's magnetic field. The crystals range in size from 30 to 120 nanometers, which is optimal for their magnetotactic abilities. Smaller crystals are not as efficient and larger crystals can form magnetic domains in opposing directions. Some magnetotactic bacteria have magnetosomes (clusters of magnetotactic crystals) that deviate from the ideal chain-like arrangement. These non-ideal arrangements may serve additional functions related to metabolism, although these functions are currently unknown.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

He is a dyslexic. Zack meets him in school one day when he was moved into a regular class from a special education class because he was doing so well in it. He likes to play Total World Conquest with the boys and Cody's friends, Warren and Jeremy, though they almost never finish their games because Zack and Cody usually end up fighting. Bob, as shown in \"Smart & Smarteree\" and \"Odd Couples\", is somewhat impatient. He speaks fluent French, as illustrated in the episode \"French 101\". In the episode, \"Back in the Game\", one of his beliefs is frequent, short naps. In \"Forever Plaid\", he states that his favourite subject is Science. Bob is shown to also be talented in well-made creating a very well made rocking chair. He has a sister, possibly his twin, as shown in \"Election\", and a younger brother mentioned in \"Twins at the Tipton\". Bob likes to visits Zack and Cody just because the doorman calls him \"sir\". He was Puck in the show's version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, is on their basketball team and worked at the boys' club seen in \"Club Twin\" selling soda. Bob is very vulnerable to poison oak, shown in the episode \"Ah! Wilderness\". In the episode \"Super Twins\", he is the first and only child to be adultified by the Meanager (Moseby) \u2013 which causes the twins remark later that he has a booming insurance business. However, this is dropped when Zack turns back time at the end of episode. Bob is Zack and Cody's most frequent friend featured on the show with 16 appearances. He visits Zack and Cody on the SS Tipton once in The Suite Life on Deck, which reveals he is now dating Cody's ex-girlfriend Barbara.\n\nParagraph 3: Concurrently, the Turkish mercenaries had drained the treasury; many of the works of art and valuables of all sorts in the palace were sold to satisfy their demands---often they themselves were the purchasers, at merely nominal prices, and resold the articles thus gained at a profit. Emeralds valued at 300,000 dinars were bought by one Turkish general for 500 dinars, and in one fortnight of the year 460/1068 articles to the value of 30,000,000 dinars were sold off to provide pay for the Turks. The precious library, which had been rendered available to the public and was one of the attractions for many who visited Cairo, was scattered; the books were torn up, thrown away, or used to light fires. At length, the Turks began fighting amongst themselves. Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan, the general of the Turks, had invested the city, which was defended by the rival faction of the Turkish guard; after burning part of Fustat and defeating the defenders, he entered as conqueror. When he reached the palace, he found al-Mustansir lodged in rooms which had been stripped bare, waited on by only three slaves, and subsisting on two loaves which were sent him daily by the daughters of Ibn Babshand, the grammarian.\n\nParagraph 4: The Fort Lauderdale Strikers chose a much longer and bumpier path to the finals, a path that included three transcontinental trips. The Strikers qualified for the playoffs by virtue of a second-place finish in the Eastern Division of the American Conference with 163 points. Their opening round series was against the California Surf. The first leg was played on the West Coast in the 69,000 seat Anaheim Stadium before a pitiful crowd of 2,929 on August 28, 1980. Fort Lauderdale won that evening, 2\u20131. The return leg was played at Lockhart Stadium on August 31, 1980, before 15,282 Striker Likers. The Surf proved to be a worthy opponent, winning, 2\u20130, to send the series to a mini-game. After a scoreless 30 minutes, the teams moved on to an NASL shoot-out. The shoot-out went a then-record, 11 rounds, before Gerd M\u00fcller's second goal of the tie breaker won it for the Strikers by a 3\u20132 margin. In the conference semifinal series they headed west again, this time to face the Edmonton Drillers, who had themselves won the Western Division. Once again, Ft. Lauderdale took game 1 on the road at Commonwealth Stadium, this time by a score of 1\u20130 on September 3, 1980. Game 2 in South Florida saw the Drillers battle to a 2\u20132, 90 minute draw that went scoreless through 15 minutes of golden goal extra time. On to a shoot-out they went. Edmonton won the shoot-out battle, 2\u20131, to tie the series and a force mini-game, but they would not win the war. The home team posted a convincing, 3\u20130, victory in the 30-minute extra session to secure their second trip to the American Conference Finals in three years. The Strikers seemed destined to rack up a record number of frequent flyer miles at this point, as they got word that the wildcard San Diego Sockers had upset their cross-state rival Tampa Bay Rowdies that same evening. This of course meant another grueling West Coast trip, instead of the easy voyage across the state for a post-season edition of the Florida Derby. Moreover, the Sockers were now coached by Ron Newman. The Strikers had fired him at the end of the 1979 season after three years, despite his being the NASL's all-time winningest coach and leading the club to the playoffs in all three seasons. As if by a scrip and just as in the two previous series, Ft. Lauderdale won the first leg on the road by one goal, 2\u20131, at Jack Murphy Stadium on September 11, 1980. When the teams played the return leg two days later at Lockhart Stadium, once again the Strikers fell, this time by a 4\u20132 scoreline. Another convincing, 3\u20130, victory in yet another mini-game tie breaker secured them their first ever trip to the Soccer Bowl.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1266 Baraq was dispatched to Central Asia to take the throne of Chagatai. Kublai instigated Baraq to attack Kaidu in 1268. At first Baraq defeated Kaidu, however, the former was defeated by the latter with the assistance of M\u00f6ngke-Tem\u00fcr, successor of Berke. When Baraq advanced towards Kaidu, the latter set a trap for the invader's troops on the bank of the Jaxartes, and defeated his forces. Transoxiana was then ravaged by Kaidu. Baraq fled to Samarkand, then Bukhara, plundering the cities along the way in an attempt to rebuild his army. These actions alarmed Kaidu, who did not want the region to be further devastated. Kaidu also needed to free up his army for a potential conflict with Kublai. Peace was therefore proposed, and Baraq was pressured by the governors of the sedentary areas of the khanate, Mas'ud Beg and Daifu, to accept. He did, and peace was declared, although sources conflict on the time and location. Rashid al-Din claims that the meeting took place in the spring of 1269 in Talas, while Wassaf writes that it took place around 1267 to the south of Samarkand. Either way, two-thirds of Transoxiana were granted to Baraq, while the other third went to Kaidu and Mengu-Timur. Kaidu also gained control of the region around Bukhara. Neither side gained control of the cities; the administration of these instead devolved to Mas'ud Beg, while Baraq and Kaidu agreed to reside only in the deserts and mountains.\n\nParagraph 6: When Togo was 8 months old, he proved his worth as a sled dog. Seppala had been hired by a client to transport him quickly to a newly discovered gold claim which would be an overnight round trip for the team. Unable to spare extra time dealing with the young Togo's antics, Seppala tethered him inside the kennel with instructions left to not let him free until he and the team were well and gone. A short while after Seppala had left, Togo broke free of the tether and jumped the kennel fence, getting his paw caught in the process. A kennel handler noticed and cut the dog down from the fencing, but before he could grab him, Togo took off to follow the team's trail. He followed them through nightfall and slept, unnoticed, near the cabin where Seppala was spending the night. The next day, Seppala spotted him far off in the distance, and understood why his dogs had been so keyed up. Togo continued to make Seppala's work difficult on the return trip to the kennel, trying to play with the work dogs and leading them in \"charges against reindeer\", pulling them off the trail. Seppala had no choice but to put him in a harness to control him, and was surprised that Togo instantly settled down. As the run wore on, Seppala kept moving Togo up the line until, at the end of the day, he was sharing the lead position with the lead dog (named \"Russky\"). Togo had logged 75 miles on his first day in harness, which was unheard of for an inexperienced young sled dog, especially a puppy. Seppala called him an \"infant prodigy\", and later added that \"I had found a natural-born leader, something I had tried for years to breed.\"\n\nParagraph 7: In 2014 the Terra Submersa team, led by Julien Beck, was waiting for permission to conduct their survey of the Franchthi area of Kiladha Bay. To bide their time they ran some training dives several hundred metres north, just outside the mouth of the Bay, at Lambayanna Beach.  These dives revealed very old pottery fragments and odd seafloor anomalies that piqued their interest.  Returning in 2015 for a more thorough investigation, they found the ruins of an Early Bronze Age city. The site spans  and lies beneath  of water. It includes the foundations of buildings, stone paved surfaces that are likely roads, and what appear to be the remains of a fortification wall with three large towers.  Such a defensive structure would be the first of its kind to be discovered from the Early Bronze Age in Greece. The visible remains of Lambayanna are dated to the Early Helladic II era (c. 2650 \u2013 c. 2200 BC), making it a contemporary of the House of the Tiles at Lerna, the building of the Great Pyramids, and both the Cycladic and Minoan cultures of the nearby Aegean islands. A second layer of Lambayanna has been identified as Early Helladic I (c. 3200 \u2013 c. 2650 BC), and a third layer has revealed pottery that dates all the way back to an intermediary period between the Bronze Age and the Neolithic, suggesting not only that the site is well over 5,000 years old, but that it may have had an overlapping relationship with the Neolithic Franchthi community.\n\nParagraph 8: Pittas started playing football as an amateur at GS Patision in 1974. He won the local championship and he also became an international with the youth team in 1976. Two years later he moved to Korinthos, where he played for three seasons and  in 1979 he won the second division at their group, as well as the promotion to the first division. In 1981 he moved to Ethnikos Piraeus, where he played for four seasons and his performances attracted the interest of the big clubs. In 1985, Pittas was transferred to the PAOK and played at the club of Thessaloniki until December 1986. In December of 1986, Pittas moved to AEK Athens and performed quite well, helping the team with his good technique and strong shot. On 24 January 1988, in a match against PAOK and while the score was at 0\u20130, at the 30th minute AEK won an indirect foul from quite a long distance and Pittas had not seen the gesture of the referee for an indirect foul, he executed directly with the ball hitting the goalkeeper's hand and ending up in the net. If the goalkeeper had let the ball go straight to the net, the goal would not count. PAOK objected, asking for the replay of the match but,  the objection fell on deaf ears. As he revealed, when the players and the referee were returning after the goal for the continuation of the match, the referee angrily addressed him and asking him if he was trying to end his refereeing career. On 7 September 1988, he scored the winner with a header against Athletic Bilbao for the UEFA Cup. He distinguished himself quite a bit in the yellow-blacks, actively participating in winning the league in 1989. An interesting story of that time is that he won a bet of 500,000 drachmas from his teammate Stelios Manolas, betting that AEK would win the championship in the end of the season, where Manolas did not expect that AEK would succeed and naturally lost the bet. He left AEK in 1989 in a bad way, having complaints mainly from the president of the club, Stratos Gidopoulos, as well as the manager, Du\u0161an Bajevi\u0107, since his contract was not renewed and at the same time the management owed him money, making an appeal and staying out of matches for a long time. He then played for 3 seasons in the second division with E.A. Rethymniakou, before ending his career in 1992.\n\nParagraph 9: The first hour of the race saw Toyota Gazoo Racing lead the race with a 1-2, after being split by Rebellion Racing\u2019s Bruno Senna early on. Senna had initially led Kamui Kobayashi in the #7 Toyota for the first 20 minutes, after an opportunistic lunge into Turn 3, successfully holding Kobayashi behind, in the Silverstone-winning Toyota, which had been slapped with a 1.4-second success handicap. The battle between the #1 Rebellion and the #7 Toyota saw Kobayashi repeatedly accelerate past Senna heading onto the long main straight at Fuji Speedway, only for the Rebellion to draft past the Toyota with its higher top-end speed, towards the end of the straight. The battle cost both drivers time against the sister #8 Toyota of S\u00e9bastien Buemi, who built up a clear advantage in the opening stint, ending hour 1 23 seconds ahead of Kobayashi. The #5 Team LNT Ginetta trailed the duelling pair by 20 seconds, with Egor Orudzhev having made a good start, briefly moving up to second with a sweeping move around Senna and Kobayashi into Turn 1, but eventually lost ground in the following corners to the pair. In LMP2, Giedo van der Garde made a swift charge to put the Racing Team Nederland Oreca 07 Gibson into the class lead, from 7th of the 8 LMP2s on the starting grid, eventually holding a commanding 23 second lead over the 2nd placed High Class Racing car. GTE-Pro saw three changes of the lead in the 1st hour, with pole-sitter Gianmaria Bruni being overtaken by Alessandro Pier Guidi in the #51 Ferrari on lap one, only for Bruni to return to the place once more, diving underneath the Italian into Turn 1 half an hour in, with Marco Sorensen putting the No. 95 Aston Martin Vantage GTE out front later on. Before the first round of pit stops took place, Sorensen led Bruni by less than a second, while Maxime Martin was third in the sister Aston Martin, ahead of Bruni\u2019s teammate Kevin Estre and the two AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE Evos. Salih Yoluc, and the TF Sport Team dominated the opening hour in GTE-Am, with the #90 TF Sport Aston Martin driver working his way into a near half-minute lead. The class triggered a safety car on the first lap, when Satoshi Hoshino careered into the side of the No. 98 Aston Martin Vantage driven by Paul Dalla Lana, at the chicane.\n\nParagraph 10: The main mountainous islands of Scotland are Skye, Mull and R\u00f9m in the Inner Hebrides and Harris within the Outer Hebrides, however Islay, Jura and, although separated from the Hebrides, Arran are all very well-regarded for their hills and mountains. Skye's Black Cuillin, composed of basalt and rough gabbro, is generally regarded as the most serious mountain terrain in Britain with bare rock, jagged in outline and steep cliffs and deep cut corries. Ropes are required for some summits and the area is host to the only Munro necessitating climbing apparatus, the In Pinn. The neighbouring Red Cuillin is composed primarily of granite and has more isolated, cone-shaped mountains of a slightly lesser height. Skye is also very well known for the Quiraing and its Old Man of Storr on the Trotternish peninsula. The isle of R\u00f9m has its own Cuillin, also composed of gabbro but shorter, grassier; necessitating good scrambling ability, and a head for heights. Multiple characteristic smaller hills are to be found on the island as well. Although only having one Munro, Ben More, Mull is a very mountainous island in its centre with Grahams and lower hills. The walking here is not as precipitous as the latter but still requires good competence. Jura is best known by the Paps of Jura, three cone-shaped, quartzite hills which are home to the Isle of Jura Fell Race and necessitate a great deal of height gain despite their size. Smaller hills are to be found nearby to them and on the remote northern half of the island. Within the Outer Hebrides, the mountains of Harris dominate, providing a stark contrast to the flatness of Lewis. The four highest mountains here are separated from each other by deep valleys, however the areas highest mountain, An Cliseam, can be climbed via a short horseshoe route. South Uist, further south in the archipelago, also has small enjoyable mountains and hills. The final island of considerable concern is Arran, which has four Corbetts and one Graham. These mountains require considerable care in places and include the A'Chir ridge, an area well-regarded by climbers; a number of approaches and routes are possible, usually starting from Glen Rosa or Glen Sannox. The St. Kilda archipelago, 40-miles west-northwest of North Uist, is also worth mentioning, consisting of four exceptionally steep-sided islands and multiple sea stacks, all but one requiring special planning and authorisation to visit and almost all necessitating safety ropes. These islands are sought after by hill baggers. Scotland also has smaller islands with conspicuous summits not part of a range, such as D\u00f9n Caan on Raasay. The highest point of this area is Sg\u00f9rr Alasdair.\n\nParagraph 11: Johnstone attempted to place much of the blame for his delay in chasing the French on a subordinate, Captain Evelyn Sutton of HMS Isis, and deprived him of his command and substantial prize money. Sutton was arrested and court-martialed, but acquitted. In response Sutton brought a suit against his former commander. Johnstone had to contest this suit, protracted by appeals, for the rest of his life, with it only being settled in his favour two days before his death. Johnstone was by now probably suffering from Hodgkin's disease, which may have been responsible for some of his lapses in judgement. He was elected as member of parliament for Lostwithiel in 1781, and continued to be an active member, opposing American independence, and government interference in the running of the East India Company. He opposed Charles James Fox's proposals for tighter controls on the company, but in a move contrary to his earlier views, supported William Pitt the Younger's scheme. Pitt's was more moderate than Fox's, allowing the Company directors to retain power over company appointments, and Johnstone may have made a deal with Pitt to support this measure in exchange for Pitt's supporting Johnstone's bid to be elected to the directorship of the company, which he achieved in 1784. The two did not collaborate closely after this, and Pitt neither brought him into his government, nor offered him a pocket borough to represent in the 1784 general election. Johnstone instead attempted to win the seat of Haddington Burghs, but was defeated. He contested Ilchester the following year, but was again defeated. After a petition however his opponent John Harcourt was declared not to have been elected, and Johnstone was elected in his stead. By now in poor health Johnstone remained only a year in Parliament, before applying for Chiltern Hundreds in 1787 to resign his seat.\n\nParagraph 12: The command of what was now called the XI Corps changed to Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard in 1863, and Steinwehr continued to command the division in the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of Gettysburg.  The corps was the victim of the surprise flanking attack by Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, and the overwhelming attack by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps on the first day of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863.  At Chancellorsville, Steinwehr's division had one brigade, that of Col Adolphus Buschbeck involved in resisting Jackson's attack. At Gettysburg, when the corps was forced to retreat back through the town to Cemetery Hill, Col Charles Coster took a brigade of Steinwehr's division out to the edge of the town, where it sacrificed itself buying time for the retreating soldiers of the other two divisions. These two defeats seriously degraded the combat effectiveness of the XI Corps and humiliated many of the German immigrant soldiers in the corps. Nevertheless, Steinwehr was well thought of by his superiors. After Chancellorsville, General Howard wrote that Steinwehr's bearing during the battle was \"cool, collected and judicious.\" Brig. Gen. Alpheus Williams, a fellow division commander, described him as a \"remarkably intelligent and agreeable person.\"\n\nParagraph 13: During his attempts to establish the truth, Sathyam faces various troubles. The Minister's proxies give him various troubles by killing children by offering them ice creams laced with drugs to eat and killing his mother. When Sathyam arrests Acharya, the Minister's proxy, and takes him to court, the Minister's henchmen attack him while driving and Sathyam is stabbed. Thillanayagam (Dilli Babu in Telugu version), the other proxy, shoots Acharya and blames Sathyam. Sathyam performs his mother's funeral rites and is suspended from the force and jailed. Manicka Vel, to be released the next day, feels sad for Sathyam and laments his loss in the jail. Thillanayagam runs for MLA with the Minister's support so that he cannot be harmed by Sathyam. He gloats to Sathyam at the jail about his newfound power and challenges Sathyam's honor and dignity. At a public rally for Thillanayagam's candidature, the Kondal Dasan openly challenges and insults Sathyam, who is released from jail by a sympathetic officer and coming to disrupt the public rally. Manicka Vel stands in the corner aiming to kill Thillanayagam and the Dasan. Sathyam arrives and exposes the Minister and Thillanayagam by shooting them and forcing them to confess the truth about the Minister's intentions and the death of the proxy. Thillanayagam reveals everything about himself, Acharya, and Dasan. While lamenting the situation he is in and calling for reform, Sathyam is shot by the Minister's henchman and questions the honesty and trust his people and fellow officers have in him. Manicka Vel arrives on the scene and salutes Sathyam, with other officers following suit. A newscast is shown with Kondal Dasan and Thillanayagam being arrested and Sathyam is reinstated in the police force. Sathyam is promoted to Deputy Commissioner by the Chief Minister and marries Deivanayaki, and the credits roll.\n\nParagraph 14: Magnetotactic crystals range anywhere in size from 30 nanometers to 120 nanometers. This size allows them to be magnetically stable and to help optimize the MTB ability toward magnetotaxis. The single domain crystals have the maximum possible magnetic moment per unit volume for a given composition. A smaller size would not be as efficient to contribute to the cellular magnetic moment, the smaller size crystals are superparamagnetic, therefore they are not continuously magnetic. Crystals exceeding 120 nanometers can form magnetic domains in opposition to the desired direction. While a single magnetosome chain could appear to be ideal for magneto-aerotaxis, a number of magnetotactic bacteria have magnetosomes or magnetosome arrangements that depart from the ideal. A reported example includes large magnetosomes (up to 200 nanometers) found in coccoid cells in Brazil. These cells contain enough magnetosomes that the calculated magnetic dipole moment of the cell is about 250 times larger than that of a typical Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum. Some bacteria have magnetosomes that are not arranged in chains, but the magnetosomes are clustered on one side of the cell. In this arrangement, the shape anisotropy of each crystal provides the stability against remagnetization, rather than the overall shape anisotropy in the magnetosome chain arrangement. These non-ideal arrangements may lead to additional, currently unknown functions of magnetosomes; possibly related to metabolism.\n\nParagraph 15: Upskilling : This category is based on a human capital investment approach, which aims to adapt workers' skills to labour market requirements through measures that may take the form of state-subsidised classes and apprenticeships helping the unemployed improve their vocational skills as a way to promote access to the labour market for workers with outdated skills or from certain disadvantaged groups such as early school leavers with few qualifications.                                                                                                                               It is widely applied in the Nordic countries and particularly in Denmark where it forms the core of the flexi security model which focuses on the empowerment of jobseekers by funding extensive training programmes which are accessible or even compulsory after one year of unemployment. The provision of basic education services can also play a role in improving human capital for certain categories such as recently arrived immigrant workers, Germany thus provided in the past few years German language skills courses that concerned 170 000 people, most asylum seekers in 2017 with efforts made to involve them into preparatory traineeship, These measures have had\u00a0 the effect of increasing their productivity, reflected in the fact that immigrants with good German writing skills see their wage gap with natives reduced by 10%\n\nParagraph 16: Upon its completion, the span became part of the Lincoln Highway. This historic transcontinental roadway's original alignment, like the Transcontinental Railroad that preceded it nearly sixty years earlier, chose to avoid crossing the Carquinez Strait entirely. The preferred option, given the engineering limitations of the day, was to skirt around the Delta by going south from Sacramento through Stockton, then proceeding west across the San Joaquin River and over the Altamont Pass, and finally reaching Oakland from the south; a route that would later become U.S. Route 50 and ultimately Interstates 5, 205, and 580. This circuitous route, several miles longer, and traversing a rather formidable mountain pass, was preferable to crossing the Carquinez Strait, a deep channel with strong currents and frequent high winds. For decades, building a bridge across the Carquinez Strait was considered prohibitively expensive and technologically risky. Once the bridge was built however, driving from Sacramento to the East Bay became much more direct. The Carquinez Bridge provided a welcome alternative route from the Central Valley to the Bay Area, one that no longer required loading one's vehicle onto and off of a ferry. With the bridge completed, the Lincoln Highway was realigned to cross the Sacramento River, then proceed southwest through Davis and Vallejo, across the Carquinez Bridge, and along the shores of the San Pablo and San Francisco bays to Richmond and Oakland; becoming U.S. Route 40, and ultimately Interstate 80.\n\nParagraph 17: In the late 19th century Fall River, Massachusetts, together with Kearny, New Jersey and St. Louis, Missouri, emerged as a stronghold for soccer in the United States. In the late 1870s Fall River experienced a period of economic growth, driven by the demand for cotton print cloth. Southeastern New England was the birthplace of the United States textile industry and Fall River became known as Spindle City. By 1876 the city was home to 43 factories, more than 30,000 looms and more than one million spindles. Keeping them all working required immigrant labor and, while some of the new arrivals were French Canadian and Irish, many also came from Lancashire and Glasgow, two of the earliest strongholds of soccer in the United Kingdom.  As a result, several soccer clubs, including Rovers, emerged within the city. In February 1884, the team was founded at a meeting held on County Street, Fall River.  The team joined the Bristol County Football Association in 1885.  Other clubs from the city included Fall River Olympics, Fall River Pan Americans and Fall River East Ends. Rovers, along with these clubs became affiliated with the American Football Association and entered the American Cup. Between 1888 and 1892 teams from Fall River won the cup five times in succession. Fall River Rovers won it in both 1888 and 1889. In 1891, Rovers, along with the Fall River Olympics, East Enders and Pawtucket Free Wanderers, formed the New England League. In 1903, Rovers won the Interstate League championship.  In 1907, they reentered the AFA.  The Rovers were the New England League champions in 1909 before joining the first Eastern Soccer League in 1910. When this league was abandoned during its only season, Rovers were in the lead. Between 1915 and 1921 they played in the Southern New England Soccer League, twice finishing as runners-up in 1917 and 1921. In 1917 they also won the Times Cup, the league cup of the SNESL, defeating J&P Coats 3\u20130 in the final.\n\nParagraph 18: \"6 Underground\" is a song by the English band Sneaker Pimps from their debut studio album Becoming X. First released as a single in the United Kingdom in September 1996, the song reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart and had moderate radio airplay in the United States, where it was shipped to modern rock and dance stations in February 1997. After the song was used in the 1997 American film The Saint, radio stations began playing \"6 Underground\" more frequently. The single was re-released in May 1997, when it peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart. In the United States, the song peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number seven on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nParagraph 19: On 1 August 2016, U.S. crewed and uncrewed aircraft carried out airstrikes on ISIL targets in Libya, responding to the U.N.-backed government's request to help push the militants from their former stronghold of Sirte (where several hundred ISIL fighters remained), in what U.S. officials described as the start of a sustained campaign against the extremist group in the city. President Barack Obama authorized the airstrikes after a recommendation by U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter; the strikes hit an ISIL tank and two vehicles that posed a threat to forces aligned with Libyan GNA (Government of National Accord). This was the third U.S. air strike against ISIL militants in Libya, but this time U.S. officials said it marked the start of a sustained air campaign rather than another isolated strike, U.S. airstrikes would continue to target ISIL in Sirte in order to enable the GNA to make a decisive, strategic advance. United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) oversaw the US effort, which was known as Operation Odyssey Lightning. AV-8B Harrier IIs assigned to the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (22nd MEU) flying off  conducted the airstrikes and uncrewed aircraft launched from undisclosed locations. Airstrikes continued, on 2 August, airstrikes hit a rocket launcher, an excavator and a pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle and on 3 August airstrikes struck a pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle; by 9 August the U.S. conducted 28 strikes against ISIL in Libya, with more than half of the strikes being conducted from uncrewed aircraft. By 16 August, U.S. airstrikes hit an ISIL vehicle and 4 militant positions in Sirte, bringing the number of U.S. airstrikes in Libya to 48. On 17 August, U.S. Africa Command officials announced on 16 August airstrikes on ISIL targets in Sirte struck 7 enemy fighting positions, 4 vehicle-borne bombs, 1 pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle, 12 enemy fighting positions and 1 command-and-control vehicle, bringing the total number of airstrikes in support of Operation Odyssey Lightning to 57. On 22 August, Stars and Stripes reported that U.S. Marine AH-1W SuperCobra helicopters participated in strikes against ISIL militants in Sirte on 20 and 21 August; a small detachment of U.S. special forces in Sirte provided most of the targeting information for the airstrikes which were then relayed to U.S. forces through Libyan government troops. On 31 August, Stars and Stripes reported that the U.S. military conducted 104 airstrikes against ISIL targets in Libya in August.\n\nParagraph 20: The relationship between theology and philosophy has been long-debated and discussed with the Christian tradition. Tertullian, an influential early Christian theologian and apologist, believed that philosophy has little to do with theology, arguing that the use of philosophy often corrupted theology, leading to unorthodox beliefs that were not grounded in the early Christian tradition. He famously asked the question 'What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?'. (Athens symbolized the philosophical approach because of its role as a leading center of Hellenistic philosophy, while Jerusalem represented Christianity because of its role as an important location and intellectual centre in the early church.) Other leaders, however, saw a closer relationship between philosophy and theology. Justin Martyr looked at people like Heraclitus and Socrates as possessing the divine light of revelation and believed them to be true philosophers. Justin saw Christianity as the True Philosophy and argued for Christianity using philosophical methods and terminology. St. Augustine, who became one of the most influential theologians in history and whose works laid the foundation for much of Western philosophy (as well as much of Western theology), espoused a more middle-of-the-road, moderate approach, arguing that philosophy and theology often complement each other while at the same time cautioning that philosophy should not always be used in theological discourse. Instead, he argued, one should make sure that a philosophical approach toward a particular issue was grounded in prior Christian commitments.\n\nParagraph 21: Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Dub\u00e9 began playing piano at the age of 3 and played in public at age 4. A child prodigy, he won a Steinway piano at the age of 9 during the national competition \"Jeunes Prodiges Mozart \u00e0  Paris\". The same year, he played as a soloist at the Maison de la Radio with the Radio France Philharmonic Orchestra, live on France Musique. His discography already includes thirty recordings including twenty CDs, especially with  Syrius, Bnl and Naxos labels  in addition to several DVDs of concertos for French television and other foreign radio and television networks. Very comfortable in all repertoires, including those for the  left hand alone, he is one of the few pianists in the world able to play Ligeti's piano concerto and to give in a single recital the \"Vingts Regards sur l\u2019Enfant J\u00e9sus \"of Messiaen. He likes to associate other arts with music (painting, sculpture, cinema, literature) and give themed recitals (bells, birds, love, dance, water and gardens ...). His interpretation of the Turangal\u00eel\u00e2 was the best show of the year in 2000 in Riga and that of Liszt's 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody won in 2002 the fastest replay in the history of Radio Chicago (WFMT station).Unanimous  First Prize of the National Conservatory of Paris( Perfectionnement) at  the age of 14 under Jacques Rouvier, he studied with Jacqueline Robin, Catherine Collard and with John O'Conor in Dublin, thanks to a full year Yvonne Lef\u00e9bure scholarship. Winner of the European Piano Competition Ouistreham Riva 2009, which also awarded him the Chopin Association Prize in Nohant, he also won the First Grand Prix unanimously and the Public Prize at the Franz Liszt Competition in Utrecht 2002 as well as other international competitions (Francis Poulenc, Bucharest, Messiaen, Bourse Yvonne Lef\u00e9bure Orl\u00e9ans XXth Century). Invited as a member of the jury of international competitions (Pinerolo 2004, Poulenc 2008, Chang Chun 2009, Franz Liszt Utrecht 2019), he also gives master classes (Finland, Hungary, Netherlands, Ecuador, Ethiopia, South Africa, China, Malta ...). He plays on all continents as a soloist, chamber music groups and with many large orchestras. He has just recorded the Liszt Sonata in addition to  a CD dedicated to  Native American Indian music for the Syrius label. He collaborates on a  regular basis with Julia Le Brun, ( a lecturer and opera specialist, www.levoyagelyrique.com)and is one of the Concertino artistic directors. ( www.concertino.fr).\n\nParagraph 22: As New England's urban, industrial economy transformed from the beginning of the early national period (~1790) to the middle of the nineteenth century, so too did its agricultural economy. At the beginning of this period, when the United States was just emerging from its colonial past, the agricultural landscape of New England was defined overwhelmingly by subsistence farming.  The primary crops produced were wheat, barley, rye, oats, turnips, parsnips, carrots, onions, cucumbers, beets, corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes, and melons.  Because there was not a sufficiently large New England-based home market for agricultural products due to the absence of a large nonagricultural population, New England farmers, by and large, had no incentive to commercialize their farms.  Thus, as farmers could not find very many markets nearby to sell to, they generally could not earn enough income with which to buy many new products for themselves. This not only meant that farmers would largely produce their own food, but also that they tended to produce their own furniture, clothing, and soap, among other household items.  Hence, according to historian Percy Bidwell, at the onset of the early national period, much of the New England agricultural economy was characterized by a \u201clack of exchange; lack of differentiation of employments or division of labor; the absence of progress in agricultural methods; a relatively low standard of living; emigration and social stagnation.\u201d  As Bidwell writes, the farming in New England at this time was \u201cpractically uniform\u201d with many farmers distributing their land \u201cin about the same proportions into pasturage, woodland, and tillage, and raised about the same crops and kept about the same kind and quantity of stock\u201d as other farmers.  This situation would, however, be radically different by 1850, by which time a highly specialized agricultural economy producing a host of new and differentiated products had emerged. Two factors were primarily responsible for the revolutionary changes in the agricultural economy of New England during the period from 1790 to 1850: (1) The rise of the manufacturing industry in New England (industrialization), and (2) agricultural competition from the western states.\n\nParagraph 23: Hanson's best-known work is Patterns of Discovery (1958), in which he argues that what we see and perceive is not what our senses receive, but is instead filtered sensory information, where the filter is our existing preconceptions \u2013 a concept later called a 'thematic framework.' He cited optical illusions such as the famous old Parisienne woman (Patterns of Discovery, p.\u00a011), which can be seen in different ways. Hanson drew a distinction between 'seeing as' and 'seeing that' which became a key idea in evolving theories of perception and meaning. He wanted to formulate a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used Charles Sanders Peirce's notion of abduction for this.\n\nParagraph 24: HMAS Maroubra (FY.40/MR) was an auxiliary powered cutter built for Hayles Magnetic Island Pty Ltd of Townsville. She was built for the Northern Territory coastal trade, and launched in 1930 by Norman Wright in Brisbane. She sailed from Townsville for Darwin in July 1930 via Cooktown and Thursday Island, where her skipper for the first leg, Captain R Hall handed her over to Captain Henry Lawson. Maroubra reached Darwin at 3 am on 25July. Captain Lawson formerly of the State Shipping Service, reported very stormy weather outside much rougher than was usually expected at that time of the year. During the trip the future operator of the vessel, and family member Jack Hayles, crushed his fingers badly in attending to the engine, and has had to have three fingers amputated, the accident was due to the unusually rough weather. Maroubra was the third vessel used by Hayles Magnetic Island Ltd in the shipping contract from Darwin to the Victoria and the Daly Rivers, and replaced Maree which, in turn replaced Magneta. With the threat of war looming Maroubra was chartered by the Australian Petroleum Company Ltd in January 1938 to convey about 4,500 gallons of aviation fuel to bases established for the patrol boat Larrakia in Arnhem Land. The petrol was held in readiness at Golburn Islands, Mllingimbi, Elcho Island and Yirkalla. Maroubra was the largest boat trading along the northern coast and was usually engaged chiefly in the transport of buffalo hides to Darwin from shooters camps on the banks of the larger rivers. No other boat in Darwin would hazard the long voyage to East Arnhem Land at that time of the year. At the same time she continued the work of supply and relief of police officers at their remote outposts.  Maroubra was requisitioned for the RAN, from Australian Petroleum, on 20 March 1942. She was commissioned as HMAS Maroubra on the 21 September 1942 for military service as a patrol boat, auxiliary minesweeper, diving and stores transporter; operating between the ports of Cairns, Townsville, Thursday Island and Darwin.  Under naval control her duties didn't change much, she still supplied the same remote outposts along with newly established military bases. On 10 May 1943 Maroubra was lying at Millingimbi in Arnhem Land when she was  strafed by nine Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters at Millingimbi, Northern Territory on 10 May 1943. She caught fire and sank or drifted ashore.\n\nParagraph 25: According to Spence, \"I received a phone call, in which NFL Films claimed my music had been 'stolen' and used in a pornographic film called Deep Throat (released on June 12, 1972 in the U.S.). They would send me a paper to sign to the effect that NFL Films was empowered to protect the music in a court of law. In all sincerity, I did not see a possible 'plot' here at all. However, I unwittingly 'punctured their balloon' by explaining that they didn't have to bother with this at all because GEMA (a German state-authorized performance rights organization) would protect my music and legally proceed after anyone who used it without permission.\" As Klein reported, \"soon afterwards, GEMA sent Spence a video copy of the film and asked him to make a list of \"where and how long\" his music appeared in it. Thus, the composer dutifully watched the film in order to find possible fragments of his music in it. Yet, the outcome was unexpected.\" In Spence's own words: \"I was surprised to find not one note of my music in the film. Na\u00efve, trusting person that I was, it never dawned on me it could possibly be a hoax to get me to sign a forthcoming document.\" According to Spence, \"the next 'trick' came several months later. I received a phone call in which I was told that NFL Films had a court case in two days against someone who had illegally used some of my music. Their lawyer had sent me a paper via Federal Express, which they said would be arriving shortly (in that same afternoon) for my signature. After signed, the FedEx courier would immediately send it back to them so they would have it in time for the court case.\" According to Klein's report, the composer received the paper in the afternoon and read it but, in Spence's words, \"after reading the paper, I called them and said that I could not sign a document with that wording. But they assured me that as soon as the case was over, they would send it back to me.\" Still unsuspecting, and trusting in the company's words, Spence signed the document and sent it to NFL Films. He never got the paper back and, to this day, the late composer's family is not receiving royalties for the many uses of Spence's music in American television shows and commercials.\n\nParagraph 26: For marching band, schools compete against other schools in the same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into nine areas (named A-I) for Conferences 5A and 6A, and five areas (A-E) for Conference 4A and down. All schools of all conferences compete in region and area competition annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Conferences 2A, 4A, and 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Conferences 3A and 5A can advance from region to area and state, in addition to schools in Conference 1A may advance from region to state (There are no Area contests for Conference 1A, only for 2A and up). In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, they need to get an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, whether it be a 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band needs to make it to the Area Final competition AND make it to the top 3 bands (or 20% of all participating area bands if 20 or more bands are competing) to get to State. The Area and State champion is the school with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.\n\nParagraph 27: In its heyday, Dalymount Park, or \"Dalyer\" as it is popularly known, regularly saw crowds of up to 40,000 for big games, however, whether it was ever able to accommodate this number of spectators safely is open to question. The stadium consisted of three sides of open terracing, one side the \"Shed End\" or \"School End\" being partly covered with a roof over half the terrace since 1945. The fourth side was the main stand, which held only 1500 seats. The stand was constructed in 1928 from iron and wood, with wooden benches and terraced standing room at the front. The floodlights that adorn Dalymount Park once thought to have stood at Arsenal's old stadium, were in fact built in Scotland. The lights were funded through what we would now refer to as crowd funding and inviting some of the bigger teams over. Initial notices suggested that the lights would be in place by September 1961, which was then extended to October and ultimately until February of 1962. In the words of Club Secretary Andy Kettle, as quoted by Ryan Clarke in his recent series on Dalymount, it also meant that Bohs could \u201cinvite many top clubs to Dublin from time to time\u201d.\n\nParagraph 28: Chapter 30, \"Toward a Theory of Strategy for Liberty\", argues that the quest to achieve liberty should be motivated by a conception of natural-rights justice, rather than utility. Rothbard discusses the strategic stance that a libertarian should take in a world where states still exist, and how to push society towards greater liberty. He argues that while the ultimate goal of the libertarian is the immediate abolition of the state as an organized engine of aggression, transitional demands and steps towards liberty in practice are necessary. However, these transitional demands should never contradict the ultimate goal of liberty. For example, a demand for a 10% reduction in the government budget each year for ten years, after which the government will disappear, may have heuristic or strategic value, but it should never imply that any faster pace towards cutting the budget would be wrong. Similarly, the idea of a comprehensive planned program towards liberty is flawed, as it implies that the state is not the enemy of mankind and that it is desirable to use the state to engineer a measured pace towards liberty. The insight that the state is the permanent enemy of mankind leads to a different strategic outlook, where libertarians push for and accept any reduction of state power or activity on any front. Rothbard argues that the reduction or abolition of a tax is always a non-contradictory reduction of state power and a step towards liberty, but its replacement by a new or increased tax elsewhere does just the opposite, for it signifies a new and additional imposition of the state on some other front. The imposition of a new tax is a means that contradicts the libertarian goal itself. Finally, Rothbard states that while the libertarian may set priorities and concentrate his energy on political issues that he deems most important, he must use his strategic intelligence and knowledge of the issues of the day to set his priorities of political importance.\n\nParagraph 29: The Swedish Army left Saxony on August 1707 to march east towards Russian territory. The army was largely newly recruited and well-equipped, numbering about 40,000 men. Rehnski\u00f6ld acted as Field Marshal and stood closest to the King at its high command. Rehnski\u00f6ld and the army command were unaware of Charles XII's plans for the campaign, which the King kept to himself, but agreed upon a preliminary march towards Russia's capital Moscow, where Peter I had gathered most of his forces. Charles XII ordered the commander of the \"Army of Courland\" in the Baltic provinces, General Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt, to join the main army in the march against Moscow. Lewenhaupt and the Army of Courland were also tasked with obtaining supplies and wagons for onward transport to the Swedish main army. Awaiting Lewenhaupt's troops, the main army advanced slowly towards the Russian border. At the end of January 1708, they arrived at Grodno, which was occupied by 9,000 men of Peter I's army. Charles XII and Rehnski\u00f6ld attacked with 800 cavalry units, and the Russian troops withdrew after a short but fierce battle. Later in the evening, Russian troops sneaked into the city to surprise the Swedes; Rehnski\u00f6ld ended up in the middle of the attacking troops, but was not recognized because of the dark sky and managed to get to safety. The attack was repelled, and the Russians were forced to retreat. Later in the year, during the crossing of the Vabitj River at the town of Holowczyn in July 1708, the Swedish vanguard encountered a Russian army in fortified positions on the opposite shore. In the battle of Holowczyn, Charles XII commanded the infantry while Rehnski\u00f6ld commanded the cavalry. The Russian troops under Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev and Prince Alexander Danilovich Menshikov were pushed back after eight hours of struggle; however the Russian Army managed to escape mostly intact so the battle was not a decisive strategic victory.\n\nParagraph 30: Totenkopf was initially held in reserve during the Battle of France and invasion of the Low Countries in May 1940. The division was committed on 16 May to the front in Belgium. Later, it was decided that Totenkopf would reinforce the breakthrough of Erwin Rommel\u2019s 7th Panzer Division in the Cambrai area. Reaching the Bazuel area straddling both sides of the river it arrived on the front on 19 May, facing elements of the French 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, 5th North African Infantry Division, and 9th Motorized Division. Totenkopf suffered 16 dead and 53 wounded while killing 200 Moroccan soldiers in its first day in action. In its first major battle it captured the town of Catillon-sur-Sambre and its associated canal in fierce house-to-house fighting, blocking the exits of the town and trapping the Moroccan force in the center around the market square, eventually captured thousands of remaining troops. Soldiers from Totenkopf executed many captured Moroccans, due to Arabs being considered \"racially inferior\". On the morning of the next day, May 20 it contained a major Moroccan counter attack near Ribeauville, driving it back with its own counter attack, before crossing the Selle river and linking up with Rommel\u2019s division in the outskirts of Cambrai. Overall in the actions around the Cambrai/Sambre area the division captured 16,000 troops.", "answers": ["Paragraph 14"], "pred": "1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,", "length": 9175, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "7d40e1fda479442b3036ee0eac74bfc78fb55f2078e861c1"}
{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: A total of twenty-nine cars were officially entered for the 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas, with the bulk of entries in Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) and Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2). The 2013 race winners, Audi Sport Team Joest, returned to defend their title. Three manufacturers were represented in LMP1, including a duo of cars entered by Audi Sport Team Joest, Toyota and Porsche. Kazuki Nakajima was not available to drive the No. 7 Toyota TS040 Hybrid because of a Super Formula commitment and was replaced by IndyCar Series driver Mike Conway. After spending the last three months recovering from a heavy crash during practice for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Lo\u00efc Duval returned to Audi Sport Team Joest after doctors granted him medical clearance. The Kodewa-backed Lotus team moved up from the LMP2 category with their new CLM P1/01 but missed the first three races because the new car was not ready. In the month before its debut, Lotus named Super GT competitor James Rossiter, experienced sports car driver Christophe Bouchut and Formula Three European Championship race winner Lucas Auer as the trio to pilot the No. 9 car. Rebellion Racing was the other representative of the LMP1 privateer teams.LMP2 consisted of four cars with twelve drivers. United SportsCar Championship participants Extreme Speed Motorsports debuted in the World Endurance Championship with a HPD ARX 03B-Honda driven by the team's regular drivers Scott Sharp, Ryan Dalziel and Ed Brown. Tsugio Matsuda returned from his four-month hiatus from prototype car racing and joined Matthew Howson and Richard Bradley in driving the No. 47 KCMG Oreca 03R-Nissan. After SMP Racing rearranged their driver lineups for Le Mans, the team returned to their regular driver pairings for the rest of the season starting at the 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas. G-Drive Racing switched from the Morgan chassis to the new Nissan powered Ligier JS P2 monocoque. The Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) field consisted of four manufacturers (Aston Martin, Ferrari, Porsche and Corvette Racing), while the Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Amateur (LMGTE Am) entrants were six teams: Aston Martin Racing, AF Corse, Prospeed Competition, Proton Competition, 8 Star Motorsports and Krohn Racing. Porsche Team Manthey changed their driver roster: Richard Lietz could not recover sufficiently from a fractured arm he sustained while practising at Virginia International Raceway. As a precaution, Lietz was replaced by Nick Tandy who was paired by J\u00f6rg Bergmeister in the No. 91 Porsche 911 RSR. Patrick Pilet moved to the No. 92 car to partner regular driver Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Makowiecki.\n\nParagraph 2: It is also the name of a Canadian military and civilian telecommunication research campus that is located on the shore of the bay. Organizations with facilities at the site include Defence Research and Development Canada, Communications Research Centre, the Canadian Space Agency's David Florida Laboratory, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Firearms Training Unit, Department of Defence firearms training area, and the Connaught National Army Cadet Summer Training Centre. In October 1952, the Canadian government set up an observatory at the site to attempt to measure magnetic or radio noise disturbances. The area includes the Innis Point Bird Observatory and the Shirley's Bay Crown Game Preserve, which is managed by the Ottawa Duck Club.\n\nParagraph 3: Scalzi also uses the Whatever to help raise money for organizations and causes he supports. Notably, in June 2007 he raised over $5000 in 6 days for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State after fellow writer Joe Hill challenged him to go visit the Creation Museum that had just opened near Cincinnati, not far from Scalzi's Ohio home, if Hill paid for the ticket, offering to match the cost with a donation to the charity of Scalzi's choice after he filed a comprehensive report on the trip online. Scalzi extended the deal to all Whatever readers, raised 256 times the admission price, and posted his critical report on the Creation Museum on November 12, 2007. In September 2010 he joined with Subterranean Press and authors Wil Wheaton, Patrick Rothfuss, Catherynne M. Valente, Rachel Swirsky and others to create a chapbook story collection called Clash of the Geeks, offered online in exchange for donations to the Michigan/Indiana affiliate of the Lupus Alliance of America. Some of the stories were selected from a competition run on Whatever to write a story to explain a painting Scalzi had commissioned from Jeff Zugale, that featured Scalzi as an orc and Wheaton riding a unicorn pegasus kitten.\n\nParagraph 4: In addition to the report that compared the effect of ALK-inhibitors to other therapy regimens detailed in the previous paragraph, several reports have focused primarily on small numbers of IMT patients treated with an ALK inhibitor. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer evaluated the effect of the ALK-inhibitor, crizotinib, on 12 ALK-positive IMT adults who had persistent and/or metastatic disease following surgical and/or drug treatment: 2 patients had complete responses, 4 had partial responses, 5 had steady disease, and none had progressive disease; 9 of these patients had at least 1 year of progression-free survival but one patient died of the disease. A review of previously published IMT patients of all ages found that: 1) 4 patients (3 with unifocal, 1 with multifocal disease) without prior treatment had complete responses to crizotinin; 2) 2 patients (1 with unifocal, 1 with multifocal disease) that had persistent disease after surgery and previously treated with chemotherapy had partial responses to crizotinib while 1 patient previously treated with a corticosteroid, prednisone, continued to have progressive disease on crizotinib; and 3) 6 patients with progressive disease after surgery (due to multifocal or unifocal disease in inaccessible sites) had complete responses (2 cases), partial responses (2 cases), stable disease (1 case), or progressive disease (1 case) in response to crizotinib. Two of these crizotinib-treated patients with progressive disease had near complete responses to second generation ALK inhibitors Another study reviewed 29 pediatric patients (age 15 months to 17 years) who were treated with an ALK inhibitor followed by surgical removal of the tumor (5 cases), surgical tumor removal followed by an ALK inhibitor (12 cases), or an ALK inhibitor without surgery. Twelve patients had complete responses, 14 partial responses, 2 stable disease, and 2 recurrences after finishing ALK inhibitor treatment. The latter two patients obtained complete responses to retreatment with crizotinib (1 case) or a second generation ALK inhibitor, ceritinib (1 case). A study of 14 pediatric patients with metastatic or inoperable ALK-positive IMT were treated with crizotinib: 5 patients obtained complete responses, 7 partial responses, and 2 stable disease. Over the study period (2\u201363 months), no patient developed progressive disease.  Numerous Medical history studies have had similar results in treated IMT with ALK inhibitors. However, ALK inhibitors have serious side effects; in on study, crizotinib treatment was associated with  pneumonia, fever of unknown cause, heart attack, sepsis, abdominal abscess, acute renal insufficiency, and the development of an abnormal EKG (i.e. QT prolongation). Entrectinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is active on ROS1 and NRTK as well as AKT, has shown clinically significant activity in individual cases of patients with IMT expressing ROS1, NRTK, and/or an ALK fusion proteins.\n\nParagraph 5: Julie is one of the twelve original characters conceived by the creator and then executive producer of Neighbours, Reg Watson. Casting director Jan Russ was tasked with finding the actors to play the original cast, with the majority chosen for their comedic skills. Vikki Blanche was cast as Julie when she was 18. She had graduated from the National Theatre drama school in November 1984 and was cast the following month. Blanche did not think she would win the role so soon after leaving school, so she \"clowned around\" at the audition. She stated \"I always thought I would have to work my way up in this industry, so I didn't really take the audition very seriously. I had an idea for a character floating around in the back of my head, so I decided to combine it with what I'd been told about Julie \u2013 and went completely over the top!\" Blanche began filming for the serial at the HSV-7 studios in Melbourne on 2 January 1985. She admitted that accepting the breakthrough role of Julie meant \"a lot of thinking and decision-making\" beforehand. She explained \"People assume you just jump at a chance like that, but in a way it's a worry. I felt I was being thrown in at the deep end. I wasn't that thrilled at first. I've seen so many go into series, then I never saw them again.\" However, she expressed her hope that the role would be long-term, as she enjoyed her character and working with the show's cast and crew. Blanche also said that due to her workload, she had lost touch with her drama school friends and her social life was non-existent outside of those she worked with. She added \"After playing a character all the week I just want to stop and catch up with myself at weekends.\" Blanche made her debut appearance in the show's first episode, broadcast on 18 March 1985.\n\nParagraph 6: Sabarimala changes him. On his return from his pilgrimage, his family discovers to their dismay that matters have swung to the other extreme. Vijayan takes faith to his heart, embraces vegetarianism and adopts a life of prayer, frugality and abstinence, eventually forsaking his debt-ridden family for a life at an ashram. His version of ashram life is one of round-the-clock prayer and an escape from daily responsibilities and work \u2014 which doesn't go well with the other residents. Soon the residents find out Vijayan has a family and abandon them thinking they would be taken care of by God since they are innocent and his primary aim for becoming a Sanyasi is to craft gold and money from the ether as some fake Sanyasi's do rather than service. The head of the ashram guides him to lose his inferiority complexes and betray himself because knowing oneself and taking up responsibilities is the foundation of true wisdom and freedom. He soon finds himself unwelcome there and returns to his home, to discover his family have moved on without him and sustains without hunger or by borrowing money as they did in the past from a tailoring business contract his wife took after he left. During her sister's marriage day she guides her sister to complete her studies and should take up a job that could make her role in their family as an equally responsible person. Vijayan tries to get back into his family which he abandoned. He tries to win his family's heart through acts and mediation's, his wife censures him for his new low. He continues with his acts to convince his wife but she finally says she sees through all these and to leave them alone. Vijayan finally breakdown but his wife rejects it which makes him declare that he is leaving them for sure if it is what they need. His wife asks him why was the emotional whimpering a moment ago and did he even think how they felt for months when Vijayan rejected and left them alone. She says there were many who suggested she remarry but she lived through each night with the hope that Vijayan would return and if this is the resolution he has come up with finally, he should go wherever he wishes. The next day with a true change of heart he returns to his teaching and the film ends with Vijayan returning to his home with his wife and children through a road where Communist leaders and Sabarimala pilgrims are marching in opposite directions.\n\nParagraph 7: Further promotion was accomplished through an international tour, with Sarbel's first stop being in Russia from 20 through 22 March 2007. There, he performed at the opening of the Greek pavilion of the MITT International Tourism Exhibition in Moscow and was received by the Greek embassy for a celebration of Greek Independence Day. Other activities included television interviews on Channel One (C1R), Muz-TV, Nastroyeniye on TV Centre and MTV, and interviews for GDE magazine and newspapers KP and Moskovskij Komsomolets (MK). Following Russia, the next stop on the tour was Sofia, Bulgaria from 26 through 28 March. Sarbel was a guest on Bulgarian National Television's (BNT) weekly entertainment show Vsichki pred ekrana and was interviewed by Bulgarian National Radio. The next day, he was a guest on BNT's morning show and shot a scene for bTV's Slavi Show. Other activities included interviews on music channels MAD TV Bulgaria and Balkanika TV, and for the Nov Folk, Koj, Eva, Express and Joy magazines. The third stop was in Istanbul through 1 April, Turkey where Sarbel was interviewed by television stations ATV, Do\u011fan News Agency and Number 1 TV, radio station Metro FM and newspaper Sabah. His appearance on the show Makina saw him perform \"Yassou Maria\" in addition to a few Turkish-language songs, including a duet with Turkish singer Ebru G\u00fcnde\u015f. A visit to Cyprus from 14 April came next, where Sarbel was interviewed on the RIK morning show 7 to 10 and performed his entry on the game show Pame Evropi. He later was a guest on television stations ANT1 Cyprus and Music Box and was photographed for an article in Cappuccino magazine. Stockholm, Sweden followed Cyprus where Sarbel gave interviews to several media outlets including Expressen, Aftonbladet, Punkt, Stockholm Finest, Plaza Kvinna, Blupp, Gylleneskor.se and Sveriges Television. The stop culminated with a nightclub performance where he sang \"Yassou Maria\" amongst several songs from his repertoire. The final stop on the promotional tour for the Greek entry was Bucharest, Romania. Sarbel performed on TVR2's Dis de seara and on the network's morning show Tonomatul where viewers were able to call or send SMS messages for the singer to respond to. Other activities included interviews on TVR's Bagag...Pentru Europa, Romantica's Teo, television stations Antena and Kiss TV, magazine Cool Girl and the radio programme Psihologul muzical, while additional performances of \"Yassou Maria\" were seen on the shows , De 3 X Femeie and Danutz SRL.\n\nParagraph 8: Williams told Tad Jones, \"Paul Gayten and Earl Palmer and all of 'em used to come up there (to Club Tijuana) just to listen to me play, because they couldn't understand what I was doing. I used to, I still do it, I played thirty-second notes with my left hand, and no drummers could do that. Plus I had a mixture. My music, my drumming, is between calypso and rock, you know, blues. I had something different going. Like a double beat on the bass drum that makes it funky. I had calypso going and funk at the same time. I started the 'double clutching' with my bass drum, with my foot. Wasn't no other drummer doing that.\" Singer, guitarist, and songwriter Earl King agreed, \"I've seen him do things with his left hand: I'm still waiting for another drummer to do it. Charles' playing emanated  out of the calypso-type stuff.\" During his time at Club Tijuana Williams often took part in drumming contests with Ricardo Lopez, a Cuban percussionist who played bongos and congas. Williams added Latin effects to his stylistic influences that included marches, country and western, and the music of the Spiritual church of his youth. He said \"I'd take all this and hook it up and make a jambalaya out of it, and it'd come out like this funky thing.\" Williams was known for his experiments with adapting Latin percussion patterns to the drum set. In his playing on Tommy Ridgely's \"The Girl Across The Street\", the shrill, metal sound he plays on the bell of his cymbal is described by writer Antoon Aukes as an Afro-Cuban c\u00e1scara that Latin percussionists would play on a cowbell or on the sides of timbales. In Ridgely's \"When I Meet My Girl\", Williams came upon the well-known drum set figure of performing the high-low conga accents with rimshot-on-snare and open snare or tom-tom, as he did in Huey Smith's \"Free, Single and Disengaged\". Ridgely remembered the sessions, \"Hungry (Williams) was on drums; this particular beat was his style- nobody could duplicate what he was doing.\" Record label owner and producer Al Reed acknowledged, \"The change came when Funky Charles started playing drums... and a whole lot of people right now aren't hip to his contribution to rock. He was the funkiest thing out. A funky beat was characterized by drummers who improvised to make people dance harder. Funky rhythms went as far back as Congo Square and Second Line, particularly in the distinctive styles of drummers like \"Tenoo\" Coleman, his pupil Williams, Smokey Johnson, and Joseph \"Zigaboo\" Modeliste of The Meters. New Orleans saxophonist Alvin \"Red\" Tyler said of Williams, \"This guy had more natural ability than all of them put together. He was another musician that couldn't read a note, but as far as feeling, he would do things on the drums most drummers would say, 'How does he do that?' And it was only because he didn't know he wasn't supposed to do it. In fact Earl Palmer and I used to get off our job and go to the place Hungry was working at.\" Palmer agreed, \"Well, if you listen to the New Orleans drummers you find that they all played more bass drum than the average guy. Listen to \u201cHungry\u201d play. He played a lot. You know, he sure could play.\" Palmer wrote in his autobiography, \u201cA guy we called Hungry, Charlie Williams, was a mother on drums, a guy who never knew how good he was.\u201d\n\nParagraph 9: DIBELS has become a fairly widely used assessment for early reading intervention by many schools in the United States but since its development and release, there have been many critics challenging the effectiveness and validity of the DIBELS assessments. One criticism has been that although the Official DIBELS homepage claims that there is an abundance of research validating the DIBELS assessments much of that was unpublished. \"Of the 89 references listed, only 18 are published in professionally reviewed journals in the fields of psychology, special education, or music therapy, and eight are chapters in edited books.\" Similar criticism notes that the DIBELS developers claim that the research base was the reason for the widespread use of the assessments, but critics say the political pressure to use DIBELS as a part of the Reading First Initiative was the reason for the widespread adoption. An article from 2005 in EducationWeek states that DIBELS got the competitive edge because its developers and their colleagues at the University of Oregon were consultants to the U.S. Department of Education for Reading First, with one of the main developers, Mr. Good, being one of the persons who evaluated 29 early literacy tests including his own product.\n\nParagraph 10: Around 18% of the total employees in the organised sector of state, both public and private, are employed in the Educational sector as in March 2020. Kerala is also one of the Indian states which spend a larger proportion of its revenue for human resource development including educational and healthcare uplifting. According to the first economic census, conducted in 1977, 99.7% of the villages in Kerala had a primary school within , 98.6% had a middle school within  and 96.7% had a high school or higher secondary school within . In 1991, Kerala became the first state in India to be recognised as completely literate, although the effective literacy rate at that time was only 90%. In 2006\u20132007, the state topped the Education Development Index (EDI) of the 21 major states in India. , enrolment in elementary education was almost 100%; and, unlike other states in India, educational opportunity was almost equally distributed among sexes, social groups, and regions. According to the 2011 census, Kerala has a 93.9% literacy, compared to the national literacy rate of 74.0%. In January 2016, Kerala became the first Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its Athulyam literacy programme.  Though the cost of education is generally considered low in Kerala, according to the 61st round of the National Sample Survey (2004\u20132005), per capita spending on education by the rural households was reported to be  for Kerala, more than twice the national average. The survey also revealed that the rural-urban difference in household expenditure on education was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India. The KITE Kerala is a state owned special purpose company under education department of the Government of Kerala. It was developed to support ICT enabled education for schools in the state. The erstwhile IT@School Project was transformed into KITE for extending its scope of operations in August 2017. Kerala is the first Indian state to have ICT-enabled education with hi-tech classrooms in all public schools. Kerala topped in the School Education Quality Index published by NITI Aayog in 2019.\n\nParagraph 11: \"All Fired Up\" is an electroclash and dance-pop track and the second single released from the band's upcoming third studio album. It was confirmed that Space Cowboy would be working on their newest album, however it was also confirmed that the band were working with Xenomania's Brian Higgins. The band confirmed that they wanted Space Cowboy to get involved in the album after he led Lady Gaga to huge success whom we worked with on tracks (\"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\"). The band wanted to work with MNEK after he produced a lot of Tinie Tempah's smash hits, and they are big fans of his music. When the band was asked to explain the single they said; \"All Fired Up\" was explained as think \"Ibiza closing party meets Miami poolside rave \u2013 the girls continue to blow us away as their signature pop vocals are played over a synth dance beat creating this anthemic dance banger.\" The band labelled the track as their \"floor filler\". The song was speculated as the second single from the band's album, due to the band announcing the All Fired Up Tour a few months before they revealed the \"All Fired Up\" as the second single. The band shared their confidence with releasing the track due to them saying \"Dance music is huge right now\" however, they said they could on judge the reaction from Twitter and when the band have performed the song and the song has been requested a lot on the radio. The band confirmed that \"All Fired Up\" would be a \"departure from dance music\" as they said \"It won't be any more dancey than \"All Fired Up\", that's as dancey as we'll get now. Our next single will be something along the lines of a ballad. There are a couple of ballads on the album.\" They went on to say if they made it any more dancey the song would be \"too hardcore\" The band revealed that Britney Spears and Rihanna's dance-pop style influenced the band to want to record a dance track. They said that the song is \"definitely more clubbier\" than their previous material. The band said releasing dance tracks is not means that they do not just have a \"typical girl band sound\", they also said \"the great thing about pop music you get to try lots of different music\". The track receive its first ever airplay on BBC Radio 1 on 22 July 2011, when Scott Mills airs it on his 'Ready for the Weekend' show between 6-7pm. In an interview, Una Healy said; \"This is [All Fired Up] definitely the danciest song we've ever made and it's the danciest track on the album too but there are lots of different styles on the album. We understand that dance music is very big at the moment and when you're a pop act you can venture into different genres.\"\n\nParagraph 12: Monica Lynch, who was one of the first employees hired by Tom Silverman, became president of the label in 1985. As A&R for the label, she signed and managed Queen Latifah, De La Soul, and host of hip hop musicians. Even though the male\u2013female power struggle in hip hop music has always been present, Lynch and her peers said that the early days of hip hop were magical times for women looking to make it in the record business. Julie Greenwald, Sylvia Robinson, DJ Jazzy Joyce, Mona Scott, and Claudine Joseph also made their mark on different areas of hip-hop. Greenwald and Robinson, like Lynch, became powerful music executives. For more than 25 years, DJ Jazzy Joyce has been one of the most visible and in-demand female turntablists. And Scott and Joseph have managed the careers of some of the biggest names in hip-hop. \"Hip-hop provided a tremendous amount of opportunities for women, which might seem antithetical because of the association that many people have with misogyny and hip-hop,\" says Lynch. \"There has been a lot of attention paid to misogynist lyrics in hip-hop over the years, and I'm not going to defend or damn it. I think it exists, but some of the people who helped put those records out were women.\"According to Jeff \"Chairman\" Mao, a key DJ in 1990s underground hip-hop and online hip-hop radio host, Monica Lynch managed the careers of Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic Force, Stetsasonic, Queen Latifah, De La Soul, Naughty by Nature among others.\n\nParagraph 13: Mar\u00eda Antonia 'La Caramba''' (1951)Doubt (1951) - Rafael FigueroaMar\u00eda Morena (1951) - El SevillanoLuna de sangre (1952) - PedroThe Song of Sister Maria (1952) - Tom\u00e1sPerseguidos (1952)Hay un camino a la derecha (1953) - MiguelI Was a Parish Priest (1953) - Mart\u00ednJudas' Kiss (1954) - Quinto LicinioAll Is Possible in Granada (1954) - Fernando OrtegaHe Died Fifteen Years Ago (1954) - DiegoHistorias de la radio (1955) - GabrielThe Cock Crow (1955) - Padre MillerLa p\u00edcara molinera (1955) - Crist\u00f3bal Paterna - el molineroRevelation (1955) - Sergio GreskyThe Big Lie (1956) - C\u00e9sar NeiraSaranno uomini (1957) - GiacomoAmanecer en Puerta Oscura (1957) - Juan Cuenca  (1957) - AntonioLa grande strada azzurra (1957) - SalvatoreVengeance (1958) - Narrador (voice, uncredited)The Mighty Crusaders (1958) - Tancredi d'AltavillaL'amore pi\u00f9 bello (1958) - MarioNight and Dawn (1958) - PedroLos clarines del miedo (1958) - AceitunoTen Ready Rifles (1959) - Jos\u00e9 IribarrenNazar\u00edn (1959) - Padre NazarioLlegaron dos hombres (1959) - SuperintendenteSonatas (1959) - Marqu\u00e9s Javier de Bradom\u00ednEl hombre de la isla (1960) - Lorenzo 'El moro'Tr\u00edo de damas (1960) - Alberto S\u00e1inz RobledoCavalcata selvaggia (1960)At Five in the Afternoon (1960) - Juan ReyesAzahares rojos (1961) - Arturo G\u00f3mez ManceraLa sed (1961)Viridiana (1961) - JorgeLa Mano en la trampa (1961) - Crist\u00f3bal Ach\u00e1valTiro al piccione (1961) - EliaHijo de Hombre (1961) - Vito Ribera - un famoso bandito sicilianoL'Eclisse (1962) - RiccardoSetenta veces siete (1962) - Pascual / The HorsethiefFra Diavolo (1962) - Fra Diavolo\n\nParagraph 14: The film begins with a shot of Baghdad in 2003, two days before the fall of Saddam's regime. It is nighttime, and the city is ablaze with fire and smoke. Two of the main characters call out the names of their loved ones from within the psychiatric ward of a Baghdad hospital, against a backdrop of explosions and gunfire. The film then cuts to five years prior in Baghdad, 1998. The three main characters, Mehdi Ali Al-Lam, Ali Hussein Araheif, and Ahlaam Mohamed Al-Saadi, are in the midst of every-day life. Ahlaam is attending University, Mehdi is getting ready to take his exam for medical school, and Ali is working as a soldier in the Iraqi military. As the movie progresses each character is faced with a turning point in their lives. For Ali, his turning point is Operation Desert Fox. He is stationed with his best friend Hasan when they are hit by the American and British bombing of Iraq in December, 1998. Hasan sustains fatal injuries, and Ali attempts to carry him to a hospital. Ali crosses a border while carrying his friend and is picked up by a van and sent to the army jail. In the army jail, he is charged as a deserter and sentenced to have his ear cut off and to incarceration in a mental asylum. For Ahlaam, the turning point is her wedding day. She is getting ready to marry her betrothed, Ahmed, when he is arrested by Saddam's men. The next time she appears in the movie, she is a patient in the same mental asylum as Ali, calling out Ahmed's name and being treated with shock therapy. For Mehdi, the turning point is when he discovers he will have to join the military rather than become a doctor as planned because his father was a communist, and thus Mehdi does not have the proper connections to achieve his goal and avoid military service. After explaining how the three main characters all arrive to the psychiatric institution, the movie cuts back to Baghdad in 2003, back to the opening scene. After serving in the military for one year, Mehdi became a doctor. In 2003, he happens to be the new doctor at the mental asylum holding Ali and Ahlaam. Presently, the mental asylum is hit by a bomb. Many of the patients, including Ahlaam, escape into Baghdad. Dr. Mehdi enlists the help of Ali to round up the patients and bring them back. The film follows Ali, Ahlaam, and Mehdi as they wander around an empty Baghdad. Ali works to recover lost patients and help bring them to safety, while Ahlaam wanders confused and lost; she is taken advantage of by a man who she thinks is Ahmed. Ali is fatally shot as he is trying to help return patients. Ahlaam runs away into an abandoned building; as Mehdi and her family try to enter to find bring her back to safety, they are blocked by American forces who don't understand the situation and answer with force. The final shot of the film shows her standing on top of the building, looking at Baghdad.\n\nParagraph 15: In the waters on the western side of Lady Julia Percy Island lies pieces of a RAAF Avro Anson aircraft. On 15 February 1944, Avro Anson AW-878 of 2 Air Observer's School (2 A.O.S.) took off from Mount Gambier airfield in South Australia at 0800L hours on 15 February 1944 to carry out a radius of action navigation exercise. They were to fly from Mount Gambier to Douglas Point, radius of action to Lady Julia Percy Island, radius of action to Douglas Point and then back to Mount Gambier. At 1230L hours by which time the aircraft had not returned to base, overdue signals were sent out. At 1300L hours a search was carried out over the route of the exercise and at 1430L hours part of the main plane of the aircraft was sighted on Lady Julia Percy Island. A fishing boat searched in the vicinity of the island that evening and passed through small pieces of wreckage strewn over about 3 miles. A further search by boat was carried out the next morning in the same area which resulted in the recovery from the sea and the island of the port and starboard wingtips, the port aileron, the door to the gunner's cockpit, portion of a main spar, the top cover of a fuel tank bay and a Mae West. The top cover of the fuel tank bay had the number AW-878 in pencil on the underneath side and the Mae West was identified as having been drawn and signed for by Flight Sergeant MacLellan on 15 February 1944. The bodies of the 4 crew members were never located. Those crew members presumed to have lost their lives in this tragic accident were: Flight Sergeant James Henry MacLellan (410684) Pilot; Flight Sergeant Dennis Leslie Baulderstone (416712); LAC Norman Thomas Kruck (433368); and LAC Brian Carter Ladyman (436921).\n\nParagraph 16: In late 2010 at CES 2011, Cricket unveiled Muve Music, the carriers own music streaming service alongside the $199 Samsung Suede SCH-r710 which was the first phone to support Muve Music and included a 4GB SD Card to store music on. Muve Music was initially included in its own $55 plan but was later expanded to all plans as a $5 add-on before being included in all plans free-of-charge. The music service was deemed by Cricket as a major success and credited with helping drive up at least 100,000 new subscribers in the course of a few months. Muve Music originally required an SD Card with a capacity of at least 4GBs to download music, the ability to do so without an SD Card was introduced in version 4.0 of Muve Music but required an internal storage capacity of at least 4GBs. Muve Music 4.0 was officially unveiled on the Samsung Galaxy S III, Samsung Galaxy S4 and Samsung Galaxy Discover while the Samsung Galaxy Admire would ship with version 3.5 but was upgradeable to version 4.0. At its peak, the service was the biggest music streaming service in regards to paying customers with a customer base of 2.3 million users and was hinted in making appearances in international markets such as in Brazil. The fate of the service was put in doubt after the acquisition of Crickets parent company, Leap Wireless, by AT&T and was rumored to be merged with AT&Ts own Beats Music service or possibly left as-is. AT&T expressed a lack of interest in maintaining the service and discontinued it in May 2014. AT&T made Muve Music inaccessible to any new phone purchased after the merger but allowed legacy handsets bought before the merger to access the service. The service was acquired by Deezer for $100 million and formally shut down on February 7, 2015. Deezer offered all Cricket customers a discounted $6 plan which was made available on January 31, 2015. Cricket offers a variety of phones including most of the latest iPhone and Android models.\n\nParagraph 17: The suburb was known as \"Flogstoghum\" in the Early Middle Ages and was a part of the Church parish of Uppsala. However, it was generally thought to be uninhabited until the late 16th century, when it became part of a 'Kronopark' or \"Crown Lands\", a semi-forested area owned directly by the Government and used for Government purposes. Until the 1840s, Flogsta was a small village and was not included within the City Limits of Uppsala. Indeed, until 1869, the city boundary of Uppsala to the West ended at Krongatan, a couple of miles to the west of the Castle, to Ekeby in 1898 and to Flogsta in 1912. Large scale habitation and concrete building started only in the 1910s as accommodation for workers in various industries in Central Uppsala, and until the 1920s there were no municipal services in Flogsta. In the 1920s, the first suburban houses came up in Flogsta as residences of white collar workers who worked in the City but wished to live close to the countryside. In the 1950s much of the suburb was earmarked for the Million Programme as student housing, and hence the suburb got its present characteristic as a densely populated \"concrete block\" student suburb only by the end of the 1960s.\n\nParagraph 18: The game is notable for combining strategy and shooter elements in gameplay. The limited unit choices (6) and specials (one for each unit) make the game extremely balanced. There are no resources needed to build units, as every player has exactly 1000 credits. Building units uses credits, but a player that loses a unit regains the money instantly and can rebuild it (or another unit), penalized only by the time taken to rebuild. Players also do not construct buildings, but use buildings located at fixed positions on the map. Players win the game by completing one of three objectives, depending on the game type:\n\nParagraph 19: In the original novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Good Witch of the North is summoned to the Munchkin Country when Dorothy Gale's falling house kills the Wicked Witch of the East. She arrives at the site of the Wicked Witch's death with three Munchkins and is the only one brave enough to speak to Dorothy, who, having killed the Witch of the East, is believed to be a powerful sorceress. She welcomes Dorothy to the Land of the Munchkins, points out the body of the dead witch and then introduces herself as the Witch of the North. Having been told that all witches are evil, Dorothy is initially frightened of her, but she assures Dorothy that she is a good witch who is much loved by her people. She also mentions that she is not as powerful as the Witch of the East had been, or she would have liberated the Munchkins from slavery herself. Using a magic slate formed from her hat, she advises Dorothy to travel to the Emerald City to seek the aid of the powerful Wizard of Oz in returning to Kansas. She kisses Dorothy on the forehead, a magical act that serves to protect Dorothy on the journey, because \"no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North\". This statement is proven to be correct later in the book, when the sight of the shining mark left by the kiss prevents Dorothy from being harmed by the Winged monkeys or the Wicked Witch of the West. The sight of this mark is also one of the factors which convinces the Wizard to admit Dorothy to his presence.\n\nParagraph 20: The Warwick Football Club was formed in 1873 in Warwick to play under Australian rules, however lacking any nearby competitors for 3 years it played mostly intra-club scratch matches until Brisbane club Civil Service travelled to Toowoomba to play against a newly formed Toowoomba Football Club in 1876. AFL Queensland cites the Toowoomba Football Club as forming in 1873, however few sources back this up. As the game spread further west of the Great Divide clubs were split on whether to adopt rugby or Australian rules. Nevertheless, it is noted that clubs from the region in this era were able to hold their own against those from Brisbane. A Toowoomba Football Association formed in 1876 teams were 16-a-side however the rules used were not fully documented and some suggest it could have been an early rugby association which would be contemporary with the code being introduced to Brisbane. The Light Infantry Corps formed to play against the Light Infantry Football Club. The Association disappeared a couple of years later. As Downs clubs lacked nearby opponents rugby was more suited to facilitating matches against New South Wales clubs, as a result local competition went into recess. An exception was an 1878 match between Old-Victorians and All Comers played in front of a large crowd.  The Queensland Football Association formed in 1880 and affiliated with the Victorian Football Association, however clubs outside of Brisbane were becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of representation for the whole colony. In 1881 matches were once again played in Toowoomba when the Toowoomba Grammar took up the sport. By 1882, a Toowoomba Association (affiliated with the QFA) had re-formed including both clubs and schools in the region. In 1883, a team of 12 travelled from Excelsior FC (Brisbane), noting a revival of the code in the region. The inclusion of the Allora Football Club at Allora in 1883 provided more regular interaction between the clubs. However the code suffered a major blow when, after the Brisbane private school association in 1887 voted to switch to rugby including Toowoomba Grammar. A senior Toowoomba Rugby Football Club formed in 1887and this was the last mention of the Toowoomba Football Club or any other Downs clubs playing Australian rules. After the collapse of the QFA in 1890 the Toowoomba Rugby Association and Toowoomba British Football Association were able to grow unopposed.\n\nParagraph 21: A feminist, her novels promoted gender equality and were mostly protagonised by young women yearning for independence. Kate O'Brien's determination to encourage a greater understanding of sexual difference \u2014 several of her books include positive gay/lesbian characters \u2014,  make her a pioneer in queer literary representation. O'Brien was herself lesbian, and had a number of relationships with women, including the novelist E.M. Delafield, and the artist Mary O'Neill, who has been described as her 'life partner'. She was very critical of conservatism in Ireland, and the banning of her books highlighted the absurdity of the Irish censorship laws. Following a debate on the banning of The Land of Spices in the Irish senate, and a campaign supported by Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in and others, the censorship laws were somewhat reformed in 1946 by creating an Appeals Board. The Land of Spices which had been banned in 1941 was 'unbanned' in 1949, but Mary Lavelle was never officially 'unbanned'. In this way, O'Brien helped bring to an end the cultural restrictions of the 1930s and 40s in the country. She lived much of her life in England and died in Faversham, near Canterbury, in 1974. At the time of her death, she was poor and most of her books were out of print. In the 1980s, her work was recovered by feminist scholars and reprinted by feminist publishers such as Arlen House in Dublin and Virago in London. She is now considered to be a major twentieth century Irish writer.\n\nParagraph 22:  S. 1561\u20131566, Begich's first bills, each introduced on August 3, 2009, would address a number of issues affecting the Arctic region. S. 1561 would increase coordination among the United States, Russia, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and other seafaring and Arctic nations with regard to navigation, monitoring of conditions, and marine pollution in Arctic waters. S.1562 would review and make more efficient scientific research being conducted in the Arctic and would direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to develop an observation, monitoring, modeling, and research plan for black carbon and other aerosols. S. 1563 would create a U.S. Ambassador At Large for Arctic Affairs. S. 1564 would increase the studying of, preparation for, and responses to oil spills that occur in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. S. 1565 would direct the United States Arctic Research Commission to submit biennial reports to Congress detailing the strategies to deal with health needs specific to populations living in the Arctic. S. 1566 would create a grant program in the Department of Agriculture to aid individuals and organizations in the Arctic in adapting to changes in climate and would fund research detailing the most appropriate responses to changes in Arctic climate. Begich later introduced S. 3580 and S.3584, which are similar to S.1564. S.1563, S.1565, S.3580, and S.3584 were reintroduced in the 112th Congress as S. 1229, S. 1227, S. 203 and S. 204. S. 1563 and S. 1565 were reintroduced in the 113th Congress as S. 270 and S. 271.\n\nParagraph 23: The clause was based on a number of precedents, including the Constitutions of Clarendon, the Bill of Rights 1689, and the Pennsylvania and New Jersey colonial constitutions. An initial draft by John Dickinson was prepared in conjunction with his drafting the Articles of Confederation.  In 1789, then-congressman James Madison prepared another draft which, following discussion and debate in the First Congress, would become part of the text of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. The Establishment Clause is complemented by the Free Exercise Clause, which allows individual citizens freedom from governmental interference in both private and public religious affairs.  \n\nParagraph 24: The Bolsheviks who took power during the October Revolution, the final phase of the Russian Revolution, were the first communist party to take power and attempt to apply the Leninist variant of Marxism in a practical way. Although they grew very quickly during the Revolution from 24,000 to 100,000 members and got 25% of the votes for the Constituent Assembly in November 1917, the Bolsheviks were a minority party when they took power by force in Petrograd and Moscow. Their advantages were discipline and a platform supporting the movement of workers, peasants, soldiers and sailors who had seized factories, organized soviets, appropriated the lands of the aristocracy and other large landholders, deserted from the army and mutinied against the navy during the Revolution.\n\nParagraph 25: First, Vinchurkar's gun infantry targeted British Resident Elphinstone's house by firing from the other side of the river. After he left, Kokare's cavalry burned all the bungalows of the British in the vicinity. The residency was left and was at once sacked and burned, and Mr. Elphinstone retired to join the troops at Khadki. A message to advance was sent to Colonel Burr who moved towards Dapodi to meet Captain Ford's corps; the corps united and together pushed on to the attack. Amazed by the advance of troops whom they believed had been bribed or panic-struck, the Maratha skirmishers fell back, and the Maratha army, already anxious from the ill-omened breaking of their standard, began to lose heart. Gokhale rode from rank to rank cheering and taunting, and opened the attack pushing forward his cavalry so as to nearly to surround the British. In their eagerness to attack a Portuguese battalion, which had come up under cover to enclosures, some of the English sepoys became separated from the rest of the line. Gokhale seized the opportunity for a charge with 6000 chosen horsemen. Colonel Burr who saw the movement recalled his men and ordered them to stand firm and keep their fire. The cavalry charge proved ineffectual. The charge was broken by a deep morass in front of the English. As the horsemen floundered in disorder the British troops fired on them with deadly effect. Only a few of the Maratha horses pressed on to the bayonets, the rest retreated or fled. The failure of their great cavalry charge disconcerted the Marathas. They began to drive off their guns, the infantry retired, and, on the advance of the British line, the field was cleared. Next morning the arrival of the light battalion and auxiliary horse from Sirur prevented Gokhale from renewing the attack. The European loss was sixty-eight and the Maratha loss 500 killed and wounded.\n\nParagraph 26: Wilde transforms the dance from a public performance for his guests, as in the Bible, to a personal dance for the king himself. He gives no description of the dance beyond the name, but the idea of a series of veils has been connected to a process of unveiling. As Malik says, \"although Wilde does not describe Salome's dance or suggest that she remove any veils, her dance is invariably assumed to be one of unveiling, thus revealing herself.\" Wilde's play has even been proposed as the origin of striptease. Toni Bentley writes \"Wilde's bracketed brevity allowed for a world of interpretation. Can the invention of striptease be traced to a single innocuous stage direction in a censored play that could barely find a theater or audience? Can Oscar Wilde be considered the unlikely father of modern striptease?\"\n\nParagraph 27: Diamond color is graded by comparing a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone is known to exhibit the very least amount of body color that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where in the range of color the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight equivalent lamps. Accurate color grading can only be performed with diamond unset, as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards (\u200ai.e.\u200a\u200a\"upside down\"\u2014\u200aresting on the face one normally looks at). When color grading is done in the mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a range of color. Grading mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as unmounted diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a range of color. While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing every color grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade range of color they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.\n\nParagraph 28: In a Welsh Gypsy tale, \u014c Gr\u012bn\u014d M\u016br\u0161 or The Green Man of Noman's Land, a youth named Jack is great at gambling. One day, he plays against a gentleman named Green Man who lives in No Man's Land, but loses. The Green Man threatens the youth with decapitation if he does not find his castle in a year and a day. Jack, his life at risk, journeys on horseback to an elder woman's house. This first old woman blows a horn and summons the people, then the birds, to see if anyone knows the location of No Man's Land. With little success, the old woman directs her to one of her sisters. The same happens to the second sister, so she directs him to the eldest sister. The eldest and third sister summons all people and all birds of the world through a horn, but the eagle is missing. The eagle comes soon after and reveals it has flown from there. The eldest sister then advises Jack to ride her horse to a lake and wait there for the Green Man's daughters to come to bathe in the shape of white birds; they will cast off their feathers and become humans, and he should steal the feathers of the third daughter. The youth follows the old woman's instructions: Jack steals the youngest's feathers and promises to return them if she carries him to her father's castle over the lake. The girl gets her feathers back and warns Jack not to reveal she was the one who carried him over to her father's house. And so it happens: Jack is flown over by the white bird and reaches the Green Man's castle. The Green Man greets him and orders him to perform tasks: first, to clean out the stables; then, to cut down large trees before midday; next, to build a barn and to thatch its roof with feathers. The Green Man's youngest daughter performs the tasks and tells Jack not to tell her father about her deeds. The fourth task is for Jack to go to a mountain and fetch an egg a bird laid there. The youngest daughter guides him: he is to throw a shoe on the lake and it will become a boat; then, to climb the mountain, she will turn her fingers into ladder steps, and Jack is to step on each one on the way up. Jack misses one of the steps and the girl's finger is broken, but they get the egg. The next day, the Green Man's youngest daughter tells Jack that the last task is for him to choose her three times from a flock of three white birds that will fly overhead three times. Jack identifies the correct bird and the Green Man declares that he can marry his daughter.\n\nParagraph 29: The j\u014d, like its larger sibling the B\u014d, was never an effective killing-weapon on the battlefield in comparison to the sword, spear, glaive and bow. Although the j\u014d and most other staves could be used to lethal effect when thrust at vital points of the body, when faced with a fully armored opponent those vital points would in most cases be covered by armour-plating. As a result, there were very few ryu that were dedicated to the staff-arts in the warring era with other more effective weapons were available, but there are several ryu that include j\u014d techniques in its system. One example is the j\u014d-tradition found in the kory\u016b art Tend\u014d-ry\u016b Naginatajutsu, founded in 1582. In Tend\u014d-ry\u016b, which uses the Naginata as the primary weapon, there are techniques with the j\u014d that simulates a scenario where the naginata has been cut in two and the wielder has to defend himself with the staff-portion only. With the onset of peace with the start of the Edo-period (1603\u20131867), the conflicts with heavy armored warriors became a thing of the past. In this era, the j\u014d art would come into its own against non-armored samurai, r\u014dnin, bandits, and other opponents. It was extensively used to police the local clan domains.\n\nParagraph 30: Kevin D. Thompson of Cox News Service said Blind Justice is \"worth your attention mostly because of Ron Eldard's standout performance as Dunbar\", a character whom he described as \"one of TV's most intriguing new characters.\" Vikki Ortiz of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel watched the premiere with members of the Badger Association of the Blind and Visually Impaired in Milwaukee and found that generally they considered it a realistic portrayal of what it is like to be blind, citing use of proper commands being given to his guide dog and having Detective Bettancourt lead him with her arm. Ortiz mentioned that several people did say that it was unrealistic that he would be allowed to carry a gun. In her review of the pilot Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times found that Blind Justice \"is at its best when portraying how people react to the character Jim Dunbar\". Stanley goes on to say in her review that \"the scenes at the precinct when he first returns to work are intelligently and delicately written. His heroism, and the groundbreaking lawsuit he filed, turned him into a celebrity cop, and his colleagues on the force greet him with graceless courtesy and palpable resentment. Dunbar is blind, but in a previous generation, he could have been black or female and encountered a similar kind of churlishness.\"\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text discusses how author John Scalzi uses his blog, called the Whatever, to raise money for organizations and causes he supports.

The 2013 race winners, Audi Sport Team Joest, returned to defend their title. Three manufacturers were represented in LMP1, including a duo of cars entered by Audi Sport Team Joest, Toyota and Porsche. Kazuki Nakajima was not available to drive the No. 7 Toyota TS040 Hybrid because of a Super Formula commitment and was replaced by IndyCar Series driver Mike Conway. After spending the last three months recovering from a heavy crash during practice for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Lo\u00efc Duval returned to Audi Sport Team Joest after doctors granted him medical clearance. The Kodewa-backed Lotus team moved up from the LMP2 category with their new CLM P1/01 but missed the first three races because the new car was not ready. In the month before its debut, Lotus named Super GT competitor James Rossiter, experienced sports car driver Christophe Bouchut and Formula Three European Championship race winner Lucas Auer as the trio to pilot the No. 9 car. Rebellion Racing was the other representative of the LMP1 privateer teams.LMP2 consisted of four cars with twelve drivers. United SportsCar Championship participants Extreme Speed Motorsports debuted in the World Endurance Championship with a HPD ARX 03B-Honda driven by the team's regular drivers Scott Sharp, Ryan Dalziel and Ed Brown. Tsugio Matsuda returned from his four-month hiatus from prototype car racing and joined Matthew Howson and Richard Bradley in driving the No. 47 KCMG Oreca 03R-Nissan. After SMP Racing rearranged their driver lineups for Le Mans, the team returned to their regular driver pairings for the rest of the season starting at the 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas. G-Drive Racing switched from the Morgan chassis to the new Nissan powered Ligier JS P2 monocoque. The Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) field consisted of four manufacturers (Aston Martin, Ferrari, Porsche and Corvette Racing), while the Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Amateur (LMGTE Am) entrants were six teams: Aston Martin Racing, AF Corse, Prospeed Competition, Proton Competition, 8 Star Motorsports and Krohn Racing. Porsche Team Manthey changed their driver roster: Richard Lietz could not recover sufficiently from a fractured arm he sustained while practising at Virginia International Raceway. As a precaution, Lietz was replaced by Nick Tandy who was paired by J\u00f6rg Bergmeister in the No. 91 Porsche 911 RSR. Patrick Pilet moved to the No. 92 car to partner regular driver Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Makowiecki.\n\nParagraph 2: It is also the name of a Canadian military and civilian telecommunication research campus that is located on the shore of the bay. Organizations with facilities at the site include Defence Research and Development Canada, Communications Research Centre, the Canadian Space Agency's David Florida Laboratory, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Firearms Training Unit, Department of Defence firearms training area, and the Connaught National Army Cadet Summer Training Centre. In October 1952, the Canadian government set up an observatory at the site to attempt to measure magnetic or radio noise disturbances. The area includes the Innis Point Bird Observatory and the Shirley's Bay Crown Game Preserve, which is managed by the Ottawa Duck Club.\n\nParagraph 3: Scalzi also uses the Whatever to help raise money for organizations and causes he supports. Notably, in June 2007 he raised over $5000 in 6 days for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State after fellow writer Joe Hill challenged him to go visit the Creation Museum that had just opened near Cincinnati, not far from Scalzi's Ohio home, if Hill paid for the ticket, offering to match the cost with a donation to the charity of Scalzi's choice after he filed a comprehensive report on the trip online. Scalzi extended the deal to all Whatever readers, raised 256 times the admission price, and posted his critical report on the Creation Museum on November 12, 2007. In September 2010 he joined with Subterranean Press and authors Wil Wheaton, Patrick Rothfuss, Catherynne M. Valente, Rachel Swirsky and others to create a chapbook story collection called Clash of the Geeks, offered online in exchange for donations to the Michigan/Indiana affiliate of the Lupus Alliance of America. Some of the stories were selected from a competition run on Whatever to write a story to explain a painting Scalzi had commissioned from Jeff Zugale, that featured Scalzi as an orc and Wheaton riding a unicorn pegasus kitten.\n\nParagraph 4: In addition to the report that compared the effect of ALK-inhibitors to other therapy regimens detailed in the previous paragraph, several reports have focused primarily on small numbers of IMT patients treated with an ALK inhibitor. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer evaluated the effect of the ALK-inhibitor, crizotinib, on 12 ALK-positive IMT adults who had persistent and/or metastatic disease following surgical and/or drug treatment: 2 patients had complete responses, 4 had partial responses, 5 had steady disease, and none had progressive disease; 9 of these patients had at least 1 year of progression-free survival but one patient died of the disease. A review of previously published IMT patients of all ages found that: 1) 4 patients (3 with unifocal, 1 with multifocal disease) without prior treatment had complete responses to crizotinin; 2) 2 patients (1 with unifocal, 1 with multifocal disease) that had persistent disease after surgery and previously treated with chemotherapy had partial responses to crizotinib while 1 patient previously treated with a corticosteroid, prednisone, continued to have progressive disease on crizotinib; and 3) 6 patients with progressive disease after surgery (due to multifocal or unifocal disease in inaccessible sites) had complete responses (2 cases), partial responses (2 cases), stable disease (1 case), or progressive disease (1 case) in response to crizotinib. Two of these crizotinib-treated patients with progressive disease had near complete responses to second generation ALK inhibitors Another study reviewed 29 pediatric patients (age 15 months to 17 years) who were treated with an ALK inhibitor followed by surgical removal of the tumor (5 cases), surgical tumor removal followed by an ALK inhibitor (12 cases), or an ALK inhibitor without surgery. Twelve patients had complete responses, 14 partial responses, 2 stable disease, and 2 recurrences after finishing ALK inhibitor treatment. The latter two patients obtained complete responses to retreatment with crizotinib (1 case) or a second generation ALK inhibitor, ceritinib (1 case). A study of 14 pediatric patients with metastatic or inoperable ALK-positive IMT were treated with crizotinib: 5 patients obtained complete responses, 7 partial responses, and 2 stable disease. Over the study period (2\u201363 months), no patient developed progressive disease.  Numerous Medical history studies have had similar results in treated IMT with ALK inhibitors. However, ALK inhibitors have serious side effects; in on study, crizotinib treatment was associated with  pneumonia, fever of unknown cause, heart attack, sepsis, abdominal abscess, acute renal insufficiency, and the development of an abnormal EKG (i.e. QT prolongation). Entrectinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is active on ROS1 and NRTK as well as AKT, has shown clinically significant activity in individual cases of patients with IMT expressing ROS1, NRTK, and/or an ALK fusion proteins.\n\nParagraph 5: Julie is one of the twelve original characters conceived by the creator and then executive producer of Neighbours, Reg Watson. Casting director Jan Russ was tasked with finding the actors to play the original cast, with the majority chosen for their comedic skills. Vikki Blanche was cast as Julie when she was 18. She had graduated from the National Theatre drama school in November 1984 and was cast the following month. Blanche did not think she would win the role so soon after leaving school, so she \"clowned around\" at the audition. She stated \"I always thought I would have to work my way up in this industry, so I didn't really take the audition very seriously. I had an idea for a character floating around in the back of my head, so I decided to combine it with what I'd been told about Julie \u2013 and went completely over the top!\" Blanche began filming for the serial at the HSV-7 studios in Melbourne on 2 January 1985. She admitted that accepting the breakthrough role of Julie meant \"a lot of thinking and decision-making\" beforehand. She explained \"People assume you just jump at a chance like that, but in a way it's a worry. I felt I was being thrown in at the deep end. I wasn't that thrilled at first. I've seen so many go into series, then I never saw them again.\" However, she expressed her hope that the role would be long-term, as she enjoyed her character and working with the show's cast and crew. Blanche also said that due to her workload, she had lost touch with her drama school friends and her social life was non-existent outside of those she worked with. She added \"After playing a character all the week I just want to stop and catch up with myself at weekends.\" Blanche made her debut appearance in the show's first episode, broadcast on 18 March 1985.\n\nParagraph 6: Sabarimala changes him. On his return from his pilgrimage, his family discovers to their dismay that matters have swung to the other extreme. Vijayan takes faith to his heart, embraces vegetarianism and adopts a life of prayer, frugality and abstinence, eventually forsaking his debt-ridden family for a life at an ashram. His version of ashram life is one of round-the-clock prayer and an escape from daily responsibilities and work \u2014 which doesn't go well with the other residents. Soon the residents find out Vijayan has a family and abandon them thinking they would be taken care of by God since they are innocent and his primary aim for becoming a Sanyasi is to craft gold and money from the ether as some fake Sanyasi's do rather than service. The head of the ashram guides him to lose his inferiority complexes and betray himself because knowing oneself and taking up responsibilities is the foundation of true wisdom and freedom. He soon finds himself unwelcome there and returns to his home, to discover his family have moved on without him and sustains without hunger or by borrowing money as they did in the past from a tailoring business contract his wife took after he left. During her sister's marriage day she guides her sister to complete her studies and should take up a job that could make her role in their family as an equally responsible person. Vijayan tries to get back into his family which he abandoned. He tries to win his family's heart through acts and mediation's, his wife censures him for his new low. He continues with his acts to convince his wife but she finally says she sees through all these and to leave them alone. Vijayan finally breakdown but his wife rejects it which makes him declare that he is leaving them for sure if it is what they need. His wife asks him why was the emotional whimpering a moment ago and did he even think how they felt for months when Vijayan rejected and left them alone. She says there were many who suggested she remarry but she lived through each night with the hope that Vijayan would return and if this is the resolution he has come up with finally, he should go wherever he wishes. The next day with a true change of heart he returns to his teaching and the film ends with Vijayan returning to his home with his wife and children through a road where Communist leaders and Sabarimala pilgrims are marching in opposite directions.\n\nParagraph 7: Further promotion was accomplished through an international tour, with Sarbel's first stop being in Russia from 20 through 22 March 2007. There, he performed at the opening of the Greek pavilion of the MITT International Tourism Exhibition in Moscow and was received by the Greek embassy for a celebration of Greek Independence Day. Other activities included television interviews on Channel One (C1R), Muz-TV, Nastroyeniye on TV Centre and MTV, and interviews for GDE magazine and newspapers KP and Moskovskij Komsomolets (MK). Following Russia, the next stop on the tour was Sofia, Bulgaria from 26 through 28 March. Sarbel was a guest on Bulgarian National Television's (BNT) weekly entertainment show Vsichki pred ekrana and was interviewed by Bulgarian National Radio. The next day, he was a guest on BNT's morning show and shot a scene for bTV's Slavi Show. Other activities included interviews on music channels MAD TV Bulgaria and Balkanika TV, and for the Nov Folk, Koj, Eva, Express and Joy magazines. The third stop was in Istanbul through 1 April, Turkey where Sarbel was interviewed by television stations ATV, Do\u011fan News Agency and Number 1 TV, radio station Metro FM and newspaper Sabah. His appearance on the show Makina saw him perform \"Yassou Maria\" in addition to a few Turkish-language songs, including a duet with Turkish singer Ebru G\u00fcnde\u015f. A visit to Cyprus from 14 April came next, where Sarbel was interviewed on the RIK morning show 7 to 10 and performed his entry on the game show Pame Evropi. He later was a guest on television stations ANT1 Cyprus and Music Box and was photographed for an article in Cappuccino magazine. Stockholm, Sweden followed Cyprus where Sarbel gave interviews to several media outlets including Expressen, Aftonbladet, Punkt, Stockholm Finest, Plaza Kvinna, Blupp, Gylleneskor.se and Sveriges Television. The stop culminated with a nightclub performance where he sang \"Yassou Maria\" amongst several songs from his repertoire. The final stop on the promotional tour for the Greek entry was Bucharest, Romania. Sarbel performed on TVR2's Dis de seara and on the network's morning show Tonomatul where viewers were able to call or send SMS messages for the singer to respond to. Other activities included interviews on TVR's Bagag...Pentru Europa, Romantica's Teo, television stations Antena and Kiss TV, magazine Cool Girl and the radio programme Psihologul muzical, while additional performances of \"Yassou Maria\" were seen on the shows , De 3 X Femeie and Danutz SRL.\n\nParagraph 8: Williams told Tad Jones, \"Paul Gayten and Earl Palmer and all of 'em used to come up there (to Club Tijuana) just to listen to me play, because they couldn't understand what I was doing. I used to, I still do it, I played thirty-second notes with my left hand, and no drummers could do that. Plus I had a mixture. My music, my drumming, is between calypso and rock, you know, blues. I had something different going. Like a double beat on the bass drum that makes it funky. I had calypso going and funk at the same time. I started the 'double clutching' with my bass drum, with my foot. Wasn't no other drummer doing that.\" Singer, guitarist, and songwriter Earl King agreed, \"I've seen him do things with his left hand: I'm still waiting for another drummer to do it. Charles' playing emanated  out of the calypso-type stuff.\" During his time at Club Tijuana Williams often took part in drumming contests with Ricardo Lopez, a Cuban percussionist who played bongos and congas. Williams added Latin effects to his stylistic influences that included marches, country and western, and the music of the Spiritual church of his youth. He said \"I'd take all this and hook it up and make a jambalaya out of it, and it'd come out like this funky thing.\" Williams was known for his experiments with adapting Latin percussion patterns to the drum set. In his playing on Tommy Ridgely's \"The Girl Across The Street\", the shrill, metal sound he plays on the bell of his cymbal is described by writer Antoon Aukes as an Afro-Cuban c\u00e1scara that Latin percussionists would play on a cowbell or on the sides of timbales. In Ridgely's \"When I Meet My Girl\", Williams came upon the well-known drum set figure of performing the high-low conga accents with rimshot-on-snare and open snare or tom-tom, as he did in Huey Smith's \"Free, Single and Disengaged\". Ridgely remembered the sessions, \"Hungry (Williams) was on drums; this particular beat was his style- nobody could duplicate what he was doing.\" Record label owner and producer Al Reed acknowledged, \"The change came when Funky Charles started playing drums... and a whole lot of people right now aren't hip to his contribution to rock. He was the funkiest thing out. A funky beat was characterized by drummers who improvised to make people dance harder. Funky rhythms went as far back as Congo Square and Second Line, particularly in the distinctive styles of drummers like \"Tenoo\" Coleman, his pupil Williams, Smokey Johnson, and Joseph \"Zigaboo\" Modeliste of The Meters. New Orleans saxophonist Alvin \"Red\" Tyler said of Williams, \"This guy had more natural ability than all of them put together. He was another musician that couldn't read a note, but as far as feeling, he would do things on the drums most drummers would say, 'How does he do that?' And it was only because he didn't know he wasn't supposed to do it. In fact Earl Palmer and I used to get off our job and go to the place Hungry was working at.\" Palmer agreed, \"Well, if you listen to the New Orleans drummers you find that they all played more bass drum than the average guy. Listen to \u201cHungry\u201d play. He played a lot. You know, he sure could play.\" Palmer wrote in his autobiography, \u201cA guy we called Hungry, Charlie Williams, was a mother on drums, a guy who never knew how good he was.\u201d\n\nParagraph 9: DIBELS has become a fairly widely used assessment for early reading intervention by many schools in the United States but since its development and release, there have been many critics challenging the effectiveness and validity of the DIBELS assessments. One criticism has been that although the Official DIBELS homepage claims that there is an abundance of research validating the DIBELS assessments much of that was unpublished. \"Of the 89 references listed, only 18 are published in professionally reviewed journals in the fields of psychology, special education, or music therapy, and eight are chapters in edited books.\" Similar criticism notes that the DIBELS developers claim that the research base was the reason for the widespread use of the assessments, but critics say the political pressure to use DIBELS as a part of the Reading First Initiative was the reason for the widespread adoption. An article from 2005 in EducationWeek states that DIBELS got the competitive edge because its developers and their colleagues at the University of Oregon were consultants to the U.S. Department of Education for Reading First, with one of the main developers, Mr. Good, being one of the persons who evaluated 29 early literacy tests including his own product.\n\nParagraph 10: Around 18% of the total employees in the organised sector of state, both public and private, are employed in the Educational sector as in March 2020. Kerala is also one of the Indian states which spend a larger proportion of its revenue for human resource development including educational and healthcare uplifting. According to the first economic census, conducted in 1977, 99.7% of the villages in Kerala had a primary school within , 98.6% had a middle school within  and 96.7% had a high school or higher secondary school within . In 1991, Kerala became the first state in India to be recognised as completely literate, although the effective literacy rate at that time was only 90%. In 2006\u20132007, the state topped the Education Development Index (EDI) of the 21 major states in India. , enrolment in elementary education was almost 100%; and, unlike other states in India, educational opportunity was almost equally distributed among sexes, social groups, and regions. According to the 2011 census, Kerala has a 93.9% literacy, compared to the national literacy rate of 74.0%. In January 2016, Kerala became the first Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its Athulyam literacy programme.  Though the cost of education is generally considered low in Kerala, according to the 61st round of the National Sample Survey (2004\u20132005), per capita spending on education by the rural households was reported to be  for Kerala, more than twice the national average. The survey also revealed that the rural-urban difference in household expenditure on education was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India. The KITE Kerala is a state owned special purpose company under education department of the Government of Kerala. It was developed to support ICT enabled education for schools in the state. The erstwhile IT@School Project was transformed into KITE for extending its scope of operations in August 2017. Kerala is the first Indian state to have ICT-enabled education with hi-tech classrooms in all public schools. Kerala topped in the School Education Quality Index published by NITI Aayog in 2019.\n\nParagraph 11: \"All Fired Up\" is an electroclash and dance-pop track and the second single released from the band's upcoming third studio album. It was confirmed that Space Cowboy would be working on their newest album, however it was also confirmed that the band were working with Xenomania's Brian Higgins. The band confirmed that they wanted Space Cowboy to get involved in the album after he led Lady Gaga to huge success whom we worked with on tracks (\"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\"). The band wanted to work with MNEK after he produced a lot of Tinie Tempah's smash hits, and they are big fans of his music. When the band was asked to explain the single they said; \"All Fired Up\" was explained as think \"Ibiza closing party meets Miami poolside rave \u2013 the girls continue to blow us away as their signature pop vocals are played over a synth dance beat creating this anthemic dance banger.\" The band labelled the track as their \"floor filler\". The song was speculated as the second single from the band's album, due to the band announcing the All Fired Up Tour a few months before they revealed the \"All Fired Up\" as the second single. The band shared their confidence with releasing the track due to them saying \"Dance music is huge right now\" however, they said they could on judge the reaction from Twitter and when the band have performed the song and the song has been requested a lot on the radio. The band confirmed that \"All Fired Up\" would be a \"departure from dance music\" as they said \"It won't be any more dancey than \"All Fired Up\", that's as dancey as we'll get now. Our next single will be something along the lines of a ballad. There are a couple of ballads on the album.\" They went on to say if they made it any more dancey the song would be \"too hardcore\" The band revealed that Britney Spears and Rihanna's dance-pop style influenced the band to want to record a dance track. They said that the song is \"definitely more clubbier\" than their previous material. The band said releasing dance tracks is not means that they do not just have a \"typical girl band sound\", they also said \"the great thing about pop music you get to try lots of different music\". The track receive its first ever airplay on BBC Radio 1 on 22 July 2011, when Scott Mills airs it on his 'Ready for the Weekend' show between 6-7pm. In an interview, Una Healy said; \"This is [All Fired Up] definitely the danciest song we've ever made and it's the danciest track on the album too but there are lots of different styles on the album. We understand that dance music is very big at the moment and when you're a pop act you can venture into different genres.\"\n\nParagraph 12: Monica Lynch, who was one of the first employees hired by Tom Silverman, became president of the label in 1985. As A&R for the label, she signed and managed Queen Latifah, De La Soul, and host of hip hop musicians. Even though the male\u2013female power struggle in hip hop music has always been present, Lynch and her peers said that the early days of hip hop were magical times for women looking to make it in the record business. Julie Greenwald, Sylvia Robinson, DJ Jazzy Joyce, Mona Scott, and Claudine Joseph also made their mark on different areas of hip-hop. Greenwald and Robinson, like Lynch, became powerful music executives. For more than 25 years, DJ Jazzy Joyce has been one of the most visible and in-demand female turntablists. And Scott and Joseph have managed the careers of some of the biggest names in hip-hop. \"Hip-hop provided a tremendous amount of opportunities for women, which might seem antithetical because of the association that many people have with misogyny and hip-hop,\" says Lynch. \"There has been a lot of attention paid to misogynist lyrics in hip-hop over the years, and I'm not going to defend or damn it. I think it exists, but some of the people who helped put those records out were women.\"According to Jeff \"Chairman\" Mao, a key DJ in 1990s underground hip-hop and online hip-hop radio host, Monica Lynch managed the careers of Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic Force, Stetsasonic, Queen Latifah, De La Soul, Naughty by Nature among others.\n\nParagraph 13: Mar\u00eda Antonia 'La Caramba''' (1951)Doubt (1951) - Rafael FigueroaMar\u00eda Morena (1951) - El SevillanoLuna de sangre (1952) - PedroThe Song of Sister Maria (1952) - Tom\u00e1sPerseguidos (1952)Hay un camino a la derecha (1953) - MiguelI Was a Parish Priest (1953) - Mart\u00ednJudas' Kiss (1954) - Quinto LicinioAll Is Possible in Granada (1954) - Fernando OrtegaHe Died Fifteen Years Ago (1954) - DiegoHistorias de la radio (1955) - GabrielThe Cock Crow (1955) - Padre MillerLa p\u00edcara molinera (1955) - Crist\u00f3bal Paterna - el molineroRevelation (1955) - Sergio GreskyThe Big Lie (1956) - C\u00e9sar NeiraSaranno uomini (1957) - GiacomoAmanecer en Puerta Oscura (1957) - Juan Cuenca  (1957) - AntonioLa grande strada azzurra (1957) - SalvatoreVengeance (1958) - Narrador (voice, uncredited)The Mighty Crusaders (1958) - Tancredi d'AltavillaL'amore pi\u00f9 bello (1958) - MarioNight and Dawn (1958) - PedroLos clarines del miedo (1958) - AceitunoTen Ready Rifles (1959) - Jos\u00e9 IribarrenNazar\u00edn (1959) - Padre NazarioLlegaron dos hombres (1959) - SuperintendenteSonatas (1959) - Marqu\u00e9s Javier de Bradom\u00ednEl hombre de la isla (1960) - Lorenzo 'El moro'Tr\u00edo de damas (1960) - Alberto S\u00e1inz RobledoCavalcata selvaggia (1960)At Five in the Afternoon (1960) - Juan ReyesAzahares rojos (1961) - Arturo G\u00f3mez ManceraLa sed (1961)Viridiana (1961) - JorgeLa Mano en la trampa (1961) - Crist\u00f3bal Ach\u00e1valTiro al piccione (1961) - EliaHijo de Hombre (1961) - Vito Ribera - un famoso bandito sicilianoL'Eclisse (1962) - RiccardoSetenta veces siete (1962) - Pascual / The HorsethiefFra Diavolo (1962) - Fra Diavolo\n\nParagraph 14: The film begins with a shot of Baghdad in 2003, two days before the fall of Saddam's regime. It is nighttime, and the city is ablaze with fire and smoke. Two of the main characters call out the names of their loved ones from within the psychiatric ward of a Baghdad hospital, against a backdrop of explosions and gunfire. The film then cuts to five years prior in Baghdad, 1998. The three main characters, Mehdi Ali Al-Lam, Ali Hussein Araheif, and Ahlaam Mohamed Al-Saadi, are in the midst of every-day life. Ahlaam is attending University, Mehdi is getting ready to take his exam for medical school, and Ali is working as a soldier in the Iraqi military. As the movie progresses each character is faced with a turning point in their lives. For Ali, his turning point is Operation Desert Fox. He is stationed with his best friend Hasan when they are hit by the American and British bombing of Iraq in December, 1998. Hasan sustains fatal injuries, and Ali attempts to carry him to a hospital. Ali crosses a border while carrying his friend and is picked up by a van and sent to the army jail. In the army jail, he is charged as a deserter and sentenced to have his ear cut off and to incarceration in a mental asylum. For Ahlaam, the turning point is her wedding day. She is getting ready to marry her betrothed, Ahmed, when he is arrested by Saddam's men. The next time she appears in the movie, she is a patient in the same mental asylum as Ali, calling out Ahmed's name and being treated with shock therapy. For Mehdi, the turning point is when he discovers he will have to join the military rather than become a doctor as planned because his father was a communist, and thus Mehdi does not have the proper connections to achieve his goal and avoid military service. After explaining how the three main characters all arrive to the psychiatric institution, the movie cuts back to Baghdad in 2003, back to the opening scene. After serving in the military for one year, Mehdi became a doctor. In 2003, he happens to be the new doctor at the mental asylum holding Ali and Ahlaam. Presently, the mental asylum is hit by a bomb. Many of the patients, including Ahlaam, escape into Baghdad. Dr. Mehdi enlists the help of Ali to round up the patients and bring them back. The film follows Ali, Ahlaam, and Mehdi as they wander around an empty Baghdad. Ali works to recover lost patients and help bring them to safety, while Ahlaam wanders confused and lost; she is taken advantage of by a man who she thinks is Ahmed. Ali is fatally shot as he is trying to help return patients. Ahlaam runs away into an abandoned building; as Mehdi and her family try to enter to find bring her back to safety, they are blocked by American forces who don't understand the situation and answer with force. The final shot of the film shows her standing on top of the building, looking at Baghdad.\n\nParagraph 15: In the waters on the western side of Lady Julia Percy Island lies pieces of a RAAF Avro Anson aircraft. On 15 February 1944, Avro Anson AW-878 of 2 Air Observer's School (2 A.O.S.) took off from Mount Gambier airfield in South Australia at 0800L hours on 15 February 1944 to carry out a radius of action navigation exercise. They were to fly from Mount Gambier to Douglas Point, radius of action to Lady Julia Percy Island, radius of action to Douglas Point and then back to Mount Gambier. At 1230L hours by which time the aircraft had not returned to base, overdue signals were sent out. At 1300L hours a search was carried out over the route of the exercise and at 1430L hours part of the main plane of the aircraft was sighted on Lady Julia Percy Island. A fishing boat searched in the vicinity of the island that evening and passed through small pieces of wreckage strewn over about 3 miles. A further search by boat was carried out the next morning in the same area which resulted in the recovery from the sea and the island of the port and starboard wingtips, the port aileron, the door to the gunner's cockpit, portion of a main spar, the top cover of a fuel tank bay and a Mae West. The top cover of the fuel tank bay had the number AW-878 in pencil on the underneath side and the Mae West was identified as having been drawn and signed for by Flight Sergeant MacLellan on 15 February 1944. The bodies of the 4 crew members were never located. Those crew members presumed to have lost their lives in this tragic accident were: Flight Sergeant James Henry MacLellan (410684) Pilot; Flight Sergeant Dennis Leslie Baulderstone (416712); LAC Norman Thomas Kruck (433368); and LAC Brian Carter Ladyman (436921).\n\nParagraph 16: In late 2010 at CES 2011, Cricket unveiled Muve Music, the carriers own music streaming service alongside the $199 Samsung Suede SCH-r710 which was the first phone to support Muve Music and included a 4GB SD Card to store music on. Muve Music was initially included in its own $55 plan but was later expanded to all plans as a $5 add-on before being included in all plans free-of-charge. The music service was deemed by Cricket as a major success and credited with helping drive up at least 100,000 new subscribers in the course of a few months. Muve Music originally required an SD Card with a capacity of at least 4GBs to download music, the ability to do so without an SD Card was introduced in version 4.0 of Muve Music but required an internal storage capacity of at least 4GBs. Muve Music 4.0 was officially unveiled on the Samsung Galaxy S III, Samsung Galaxy S4 and Samsung Galaxy Discover while the Samsung Galaxy Admire would ship with version 3.5 but was upgradeable to version 4.0. At its peak, the service was the biggest music streaming service in regards to paying customers with a customer base of 2.3 million users and was hinted in making appearances in international markets such as in Brazil. The fate of the service was put in doubt after the acquisition of Crickets parent company, Leap Wireless, by AT&T and was rumored to be merged with AT&Ts own Beats Music service or possibly left as-is. AT&T expressed a lack of interest in maintaining the service and discontinued it in May 2014. AT&T made Muve Music inaccessible to any new phone purchased after the merger but allowed legacy handsets bought before the merger to access the service. The service was acquired by Deezer for $100 million and formally shut down on February 7, 2015. Deezer offered all Cricket customers a discounted $6 plan which was made available on January 31, 2015. Cricket offers a variety of phones including most of the latest iPhone and Android models.\n\nParagraph 17: The suburb was known as \"Flogstoghum\" in the Early Middle Ages and was a part of the Church parish of Uppsala. However, it was generally thought to be uninhabited until the late 16th century, when it became part of a 'Kronopark' or \"Crown Lands\", a semi-forested area owned directly by the Government and used for Government purposes. Until the 1840s, Flogsta was a small village and was not included within the City Limits of Uppsala. Indeed, until 1869, the city boundary of Uppsala to the West ended at Krongatan, a couple of miles to the west of the Castle, to Ekeby in 1898 and to Flogsta in 1912. Large scale habitation and concrete building started only in the 1910s as accommodation for workers in various industries in Central Uppsala, and until the 1920s there were no municipal services in Flogsta. In the 1920s, the first suburban houses came up in Flogsta as residences of white collar workers who worked in the City but wished to live close to the countryside. In the 1950s much of the suburb was earmarked for the Million Programme as student housing, and hence the suburb got its present characteristic as a densely populated \"concrete block\" student suburb only by the end of the 1960s.\n\nParagraph 18: The game is notable for combining strategy and shooter elements in gameplay. The limited unit choices (6) and specials (one for each unit) make the game extremely balanced. There are no resources needed to build units, as every player has exactly 1000 credits. Building units uses credits, but a player that loses a unit regains the money instantly and can rebuild it (or another unit), penalized only by the time taken to rebuild. Players also do not construct buildings, but use buildings located at fixed positions on the map. Players win the game by completing one of three objectives, depending on the game type:\n\nParagraph 19: In the original novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Good Witch of the North is summoned to the Munchkin Country when Dorothy Gale's falling house kills the Wicked Witch of the East. She arrives at the site of the Wicked Witch's death with three Munchkins and is the only one brave enough to speak to Dorothy, who, having killed the Witch of the East, is believed to be a powerful sorceress. She welcomes Dorothy to the Land of the Munchkins, points out the body of the dead witch and then introduces herself as the Witch of the North. Having been told that all witches are evil, Dorothy is initially frightened of her, but she assures Dorothy that she is a good witch who is much loved by her people. She also mentions that she is not as powerful as the Witch of the East had been, or she would have liberated the Munchkins from slavery herself. Using a magic slate formed from her hat, she advises Dorothy to travel to the Emerald City to seek the aid of the powerful Wizard of Oz in returning to Kansas. She kisses Dorothy on the forehead, a magical act that serves to protect Dorothy on the journey, because \"no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North\". This statement is proven to be correct later in the book, when the sight of the shining mark left by the kiss prevents Dorothy from being harmed by the Winged monkeys or the Wicked Witch of the West. The sight of this mark is also one of the factors which convinces the Wizard to admit Dorothy to his presence.\n\nParagraph 20: The Warwick Football Club was formed in 1873 in Warwick to play under Australian rules, however lacking any nearby competitors for 3 years it played mostly intra-club scratch matches until Brisbane club Civil Service travelled to Toowoomba to play against a newly formed Toowoomba Football Club in 1876. AFL Queensland cites the Toowoomba Football Club as forming in 1873, however few sources back this up. As the game spread further west of the Great Divide clubs were split on whether to adopt rugby or Australian rules. Nevertheless, it is noted that clubs from the region in this era were able to hold their own against those from Brisbane. A Toowoomba Football Association formed in 1876 teams were 16-a-side however the rules used were not fully documented and some suggest it could have been an early rugby association which would be contemporary with the code being introduced to Brisbane. The Light Infantry Corps formed to play against the Light Infantry Football Club. The Association disappeared a couple of years later. As Downs clubs lacked nearby opponents rugby was more suited to facilitating matches against New South Wales clubs, as a result local competition went into recess. An exception was an 1878 match between Old-Victorians and All Comers played in front of a large crowd.  The Queensland Football Association formed in 1880 and affiliated with the Victorian Football Association, however clubs outside of Brisbane were becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of representation for the whole colony. In 1881 matches were once again played in Toowoomba when the Toowoomba Grammar took up the sport. By 1882, a Toowoomba Association (affiliated with the QFA) had re-formed including both clubs and schools in the region. In 1883, a team of 12 travelled from Excelsior FC (Brisbane), noting a revival of the code in the region. The inclusion of the Allora Football Club at Allora in 1883 provided more regular interaction between the clubs. However the code suffered a major blow when, after the Brisbane private school association in 1887 voted to switch to rugby including Toowoomba Grammar. A senior Toowoomba Rugby Football Club formed in 1887and this was the last mention of the Toowoomba Football Club or any other Downs clubs playing Australian rules. After the collapse of the QFA in 1890 the Toowoomba Rugby Association and Toowoomba British Football Association were able to grow unopposed.\n\nParagraph 21: A feminist, her novels promoted gender equality and were mostly protagonised by young women yearning for independence. Kate O'Brien's determination to encourage a greater understanding of sexual difference \u2014 several of her books include positive gay/lesbian characters \u2014,  make her a pioneer in queer literary representation. O'Brien was herself lesbian, and had a number of relationships with women, including the novelist E.M. Delafield, and the artist Mary O'Neill, who has been described as her 'life partner'. She was very critical of conservatism in Ireland, and the banning of her books highlighted the absurdity of the Irish censorship laws. Following a debate on the banning of The Land of Spices in the Irish senate, and a campaign supported by Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in and others, the censorship laws were somewhat reformed in 1946 by creating an Appeals Board. The Land of Spices which had been banned in 1941 was 'unbanned' in 1949, but Mary Lavelle was never officially 'unbanned'. In this way, O'Brien helped bring to an end the cultural restrictions of the 1930s and 40s in the country. She lived much of her life in England and died in Faversham, near Canterbury, in 1974. At the time of her death, she was poor and most of her books were out of print. In the 1980s, her work was recovered by feminist scholars and reprinted by feminist publishers such as Arlen House in Dublin and Virago in London. She is now considered to be a major twentieth century Irish writer.\n\nParagraph 22:  S. 1561\u20131566, Begich's first bills, each introduced on August 3, 2009, would address a number of issues affecting the Arctic region. S. 1561 would increase coordination among the United States, Russia, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and other seafaring and Arctic nations with regard to navigation, monitoring of conditions, and marine pollution in Arctic waters. S.1562 would review and make more efficient scientific research being conducted in the Arctic and would direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to develop an observation, monitoring, modeling, and research plan for black carbon and other aerosols. S. 1563 would create a U.S. Ambassador At Large for Arctic Affairs. S. 1564 would increase the studying of, preparation for, and responses to oil spills that occur in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. S. 1565 would direct the United States Arctic Research Commission to submit biennial reports to Congress detailing the strategies to deal with health needs specific to populations living in the Arctic. S. 1566 would create a grant program in the Department of Agriculture to aid individuals and organizations in the Arctic in adapting to changes in climate and would fund research detailing the most appropriate responses to changes in Arctic climate. Begich later introduced S. 3580 and S.3584, which are similar to S.1564. S.1563, S.1565, S.3580, and S.3584 were reintroduced in the 112th Congress as S. 1229, S. 1227, S. 203 and S. 204. S. 1563 and S. 1565 were reintroduced in the 113th Congress as S. 270 and S. 271.\n\nParagraph 23: The clause was based on a number of precedents, including the Constitutions of Clarendon, the Bill of Rights 1689, and the Pennsylvania and New Jersey colonial constitutions. An initial draft by John Dickinson was prepared in conjunction with his drafting the Articles of Confederation.  In 1789, then-congressman James Madison prepared another draft which, following discussion and debate in the First Congress, would become part of the text of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. The Establishment Clause is complemented by the Free Exercise Clause, which allows individual citizens freedom from governmental interference in both private and public religious affairs.  \n\nParagraph 24: The Bolsheviks who took power during the October Revolution, the final phase of the Russian Revolution, were the first communist party to take power and attempt to apply the Leninist variant of Marxism in a practical way. Although they grew very quickly during the Revolution from 24,000 to 100,000 members and got 25% of the votes for the Constituent Assembly in November 1917, the Bolsheviks were a minority party when they took power by force in Petrograd and Moscow. Their advantages were discipline and a platform supporting the movement of workers, peasants, soldiers and sailors who had seized factories, organized soviets, appropriated the lands of the aristocracy and other large landholders, deserted from the army and mutinied against the navy during the Revolution.\n\nParagraph 25: First, Vinchurkar's gun infantry targeted British Resident Elphinstone's house by firing from the other side of the river. After he left, Kokare's cavalry burned all the bungalows of the British in the vicinity. The residency was left and was at once sacked and burned, and Mr. Elphinstone retired to join the troops at Khadki. A message to advance was sent to Colonel Burr who moved towards Dapodi to meet Captain Ford's corps; the corps united and together pushed on to the attack. Amazed by the advance of troops whom they believed had been bribed or panic-struck, the Maratha skirmishers fell back, and the Maratha army, already anxious from the ill-omened breaking of their standard, began to lose heart. Gokhale rode from rank to rank cheering and taunting, and opened the attack pushing forward his cavalry so as to nearly to surround the British. In their eagerness to attack a Portuguese battalion, which had come up under cover to enclosures, some of the English sepoys became separated from the rest of the line. Gokhale seized the opportunity for a charge with 6000 chosen horsemen. Colonel Burr who saw the movement recalled his men and ordered them to stand firm and keep their fire. The cavalry charge proved ineffectual. The charge was broken by a deep morass in front of the English. As the horsemen floundered in disorder the British troops fired on them with deadly effect. Only a few of the Maratha horses pressed on to the bayonets, the rest retreated or fled. The failure of their great cavalry charge disconcerted the Marathas. They began to drive off their guns, the infantry retired, and, on the advance of the British line, the field was cleared. Next morning the arrival of the light battalion and auxiliary horse from Sirur prevented Gokhale from renewing the attack. The European loss was sixty-eight and the Maratha loss 500 killed and wounded.\n\nParagraph 26: Wilde transforms the dance from a public performance for his guests, as in the Bible, to a personal dance for the king himself. He gives no description of the dance beyond the name, but the idea of a series of veils has been connected to a process of unveiling. As Malik says, \"although Wilde does not describe Salome's dance or suggest that she remove any veils, her dance is invariably assumed to be one of unveiling, thus revealing herself.\" Wilde's play has even been proposed as the origin of striptease. Toni Bentley writes \"Wilde's bracketed brevity allowed for a world of interpretation. Can the invention of striptease be traced to a single innocuous stage direction in a censored play that could barely find a theater or audience? Can Oscar Wilde be considered the unlikely father of modern striptease?\"\n\nParagraph 27: Diamond color is graded by comparing a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone is known to exhibit the very least amount of body color that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where in the range of color the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight equivalent lamps. Accurate color grading can only be performed with diamond unset, as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards (\u200ai.e.\u200a\u200a\"upside down\"\u2014\u200aresting on the face one normally looks at). When color grading is done in the mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a range of color. Grading mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as unmounted diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a range of color. While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing every color grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade range of color they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.\n\nParagraph 28: In a Welsh Gypsy tale, \u014c Gr\u012bn\u014d M\u016br\u0161 or The Green Man of Noman's Land, a youth named Jack is great at gambling. One day, he plays against a gentleman named Green Man who lives in No Man's Land, but loses. The Green Man threatens the youth with decapitation if he does not find his castle in a year and a day. Jack, his life at risk, journeys on horseback to an elder woman's house. This first old woman blows a horn and summons the people, then the birds, to see if anyone knows the location of No Man's Land. With little success, the old woman directs her to one of her sisters. The same happens to the second sister, so she directs him to the eldest sister. The eldest and third sister summons all people and all birds of the world through a horn, but the eagle is missing. The eagle comes soon after and reveals it has flown from there. The eldest sister then advises Jack to ride her horse to a lake and wait there for the Green Man's daughters to come to bathe in the shape of white birds; they will cast off their feathers and become humans, and he should steal the feathers of the third daughter. The youth follows the old woman's instructions: Jack steals the youngest's feathers and promises to return them if she carries him to her father's castle over the lake. The girl gets her feathers back and warns Jack not to reveal she was the one who carried him over to her father's house. And so it happens: Jack is flown over by the white bird and reaches the Green Man's castle. The Green Man greets him and orders him to perform tasks: first, to clean out the stables; then, to cut down large trees before midday; next, to build a barn and to thatch its roof with feathers. The Green Man's youngest daughter performs the tasks and tells Jack not to tell her father about her deeds. The fourth task is for Jack to go to a mountain and fetch an egg a bird laid there. The youngest daughter guides him: he is to throw a shoe on the lake and it will become a boat; then, to climb the mountain, she will turn her fingers into ladder steps, and Jack is to step on each one on the way up. Jack misses one of the steps and the girl's finger is broken, but they get the egg. The next day, the Green Man's youngest daughter tells Jack that the last task is for him to choose her three times from a flock of three white birds that will fly overhead three times. Jack identifies the correct bird and the Green Man declares that he can marry his daughter.\n\nParagraph 29: The j\u014d, like its larger sibling the B\u014d, was never an effective killing-weapon on the battlefield in comparison to the sword, spear, glaive and bow. Although the j\u014d and most other staves could be used to lethal effect when thrust at vital points of the body, when faced with a fully armored opponent those vital points would in most cases be covered by armour-plating. As a result, there were very few ryu that were dedicated to the staff-arts in the warring era with other more effective weapons were available, but there are several ryu that include j\u014d techniques in its system. One example is the j\u014d-tradition found in the kory\u016b art Tend\u014d-ry\u016b Naginatajutsu, founded in 1582. In Tend\u014d-ry\u016b, which uses the Naginata as the primary weapon, there are techniques with the j\u014d that simulates a scenario where the naginata has been cut in two and the wielder has to defend himself with the staff-portion only. With the onset of peace with the start of the Edo-period (1603\u20131867), the conflicts with heavy armored warriors became a thing of the past. In this era, the j\u014d art would come into its own against non-armored samurai, r\u014dnin, bandits, and other opponents. It was extensively used to police the local clan domains.\n\nParagraph 30: Kevin D. Thompson of Cox News Service said Blind Justice is \"worth your attention mostly because of Ron Eldard's standout performance as Dunbar\", a character whom he described as \"one of TV's most intriguing new characters.\" Vikki Ortiz of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel watched the premiere with members of the Badger Association of the Blind and Visually Impaired in Milwaukee and found that generally they considered it a realistic portrayal of what it is like to be blind, citing use of proper commands being given to his guide dog and having Detective Bettancourt lead him with her arm. Ortiz mentioned that several people did say that it was unrealistic that he would be allowed to carry a gun. In her review of the pilot Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times found that Blind Justice \"is at its best when portraying how people react to the character Jim Dunbar\". Stanley goes on to say in her review that \"the scenes at the precinct when he first returns to work are intelligently and delicately written. His heroism, and the groundbreaking lawsuit he filed, turned him into a celebrity cop, and his colleagues on the force greet him with graceless courtesy and palpable resentment. Dunbar is blind, but in a previous generation, he could have been black or female and encountered a similar kind of churlishness.\"", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "pred": "2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,", "length": 9139, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3cdab3983562bc0d09ca6edff3165b60549755f4e9dc5c76"}

The food is high in butter and fat while staying low in spices except for black pepper, dill or grains/seeds, such as caraway seeds. Latvian cuisine originated from the peasant culture and is strongly based on crops that grow in Latvia's maritime, temperate climate. Rye or wheat, oats, peas, beets, cabbage, pork products, and potatoes are the staples. Latvian cuisine offers plenty of varieties of bread and dairy products, which are an important part of the cuisine. Meat features in most main meal dishes, but fish also is commonly consumed, especially in the coastal areas next to Baltic Sea. Both are also smoked.\n\nParagraph 2: Two branches on the line north of New Brunswick were built, one to Carteret and one towards Perth Amboy, both merging towards the north. The Carteret branch used shuttle operations, with a transfer at the junction with the mainline, but Perth Amboy trains ran all the way to Newark. On the Perth Amboy end, they used existing trackage from the end of private right-of-way along Woodbridge Avenue, East Avenue, Broad Street, private right-of-way south, west across West Avenue, and south along the east side of the CNJ line to the Woodbridge Creek bridge, then south on West Avenue and State Street, ending at Smith Street.\n\nParagraph 3: Elvis Presley was an American entertainer who achieved great initial success as a singer and stage performer. He publicly expressed an early career goal of following in the footsteps of his role models James Dean and Marlon Brando to become a top dramatic actor. His manager Colonel Tom Parker's persistent lobbying of William Morris Agency president Abe Lastfogel for a Presley screen test paid off on March 26, 1956, when the singer auditioned at Paramount for a supporting role in The Rainmaker. Although not chosen for the part, he signed a contract with Paramount producer Hal Wallis on April 25 that also allowed him to make films with other studios.\n\nParagraph 4: Tosh becomes pregnant through the insemination and they announce this at Stan's birthday party, although she loses the baby soon after. Depressed at this, Tosh accepts Tina's nephew Dean Wicks' (Matt Di Angelo) offer of being a sperm donor, without Tina's knowledge or consent. Tina is angry when she finds out, but forgives Tosh and supports her when she discovers she is not pregnant again. They fall out when Tosh accuses her of not wanting a baby, and Tosh punches her after taunting her. Tina again forgives her and decides to try and reconcile Tosh with her family by arranging a lunch for them. Her mother Judy (Jo Martin) comes, but her father makes an excuse, uncomfortable with Tosh's sexuality due to his Christian faith. Judy storms out when Tina tells her about their attempts to have a baby, upsetting Tosh further. Tina is devastated when Stan reveals that he is dying from prostate cancer, and is even more upset when she learns that Stan knew about his illness 3 years prior to him telling the family. She and Tosh urge Stan to see a private doctor, however he reveals that Stan's cancer is too aggressive to be cured, which leaves Tina distraught. Tina supports Sonia when she falls ill, and she confides in her that she spent the money from the charity calendar she organised on a gastric band in Bulgaria, to impress her husband Martin (James Bye). Tosh returns home while Sonia is hiding in Tina's room, but she manages to sneak out before Tosh realizes. When Martin fails to turn up to the Christmas party for Sonia's group \"Fat Blasters\", Sonia decides to announce her actions but Tina urges her not to; however, before she can, she collapses. When the paramedics arrive, Tina reveals Sonia has had an operation to fit a gastric band, which shocks Carol and Martin. Babe leads Tosh to believe that Tina is having an affair with Sonia and when Tina denies this, Tosh viciously beats her. The next day, Tina decides that she cannot forgive Tosh for what she has done and thinks it best to move back to the Vic, while Tosh leaves Walford when Tina breaks up with her. Mick stops Tina assisting Stan's requested suicide. Tina is devastated by Stan's death and delivers the eulogy. Tina and Sonia become partners, splitting up briefly when Tina finds out Sonia cheated with her estranged husband Martin. They reconcile when Sonia helps Linda after she goes into premature labour.\n\nParagraph 5: The 2011 prize was judged by Rick Gekoski (Chair), Carmen Callil (withdrew in protest over choice of winner) and Justin Cartwright. The nominees for the fourth Man Booker International Prize were announced on 30 March 2011 at a ceremony in Sydney, Australia. John le Carr\u00e9 asked to be removed from consideration, saying he was \"flattered\", but that he does not compete for literary prizes. However, judge Dr Rick Gekoski said although he was disappointed that le Carr\u00e9 wanted to withdraw, his name would remain on the list. American novelist Roth was announced as the winner on 18 May 2011 at the Sydney Writers' Festival. Of his win, Roth said \"This is a great honour and I'm delighted to receive it.\" The writer said he hoped the prize would bring him to the attention of readers around the world who are not currently familiar with his body of work. Roth received his award in London on 28 June; however, he was unable to attend in person due to ill health, so he sent a short video instead. After Roth was announced as the winner, Carmen Callil withdrew from the judging panel, saying \"I don't rate him as a writer at all... in 20 years' time will anyone read him?\" Callil later wrote an editorial in The Guardian explaining her position and why she chose to leave the panel.\n\nParagraph 6: The 1940 season can arguably be called the greatest year in the history of Boston College football. BC's undefeated (11\u20130) and untied team, captured the 1941 Sugar Bowl championship and earned the nickname \"Team of Destiny\". Five members of that storied team have been inducted into the National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame: receiver Gene Goodreault (50); guard George Kerr (47); center Chet Gladchuk (45); fullback Mike Holovak (12); and halfback / quarterback Charlie O'Rourke (13). It included a 19\u201318 victory over No. 9 Georgetown before 41,700 fans at sold-out Fenway Park, that was called one of the greatest games ever by famed sportswriter Grantland Rice. Going into the game, the Hoyas had 22 consecutive victories spanning three seasons. BC trailed until the third quarter, when a 43-yard touchdown pass from Charlie O'Rourke to Monk Maznicki put the Eagles ahead. With just seconds remaining, BC had the ball on their own nine, fourth down and 18 to go. Georgetown set up to return the Eagles' punt. Instead of punting, O'Rourke scrambled in his own end zone for 45 seconds then took a safety. BC used the free kick to boot the ball far downfield and dashed the Hoyas' three-season unbeaten record. Legendary Coach Frank Leahy, who would go on to cement his legendary status during an eleven-year stint as head coach at Notre Dame, took his undefeated Eagles on to the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans where they beat No. 4 Tennessee 19\u201313. Trailing 7\u201313 in the fourth quarter, Tennessee's Bob Foxx missed a short field goal attempt with three minutes remaining, and Boston College took over on its own 20\u2013yard line. Quarterback Charlie O'Rourke led the Eagles on an eighty-yard drive, capped with his 24-yard touchdown run to seal the victory. A banner on campus commemorating the team uses the phrase \"national champions\", but Boston College was not awarded a national championship by any of the national polls at the time of the 1940 season. Although BC's claim to a title is not recognized by the NCAA or college football historians in general, one website, the College Football Data Warehouse, claims that selectors named Cliff Morgan and Ray Bryne rated BC No. 1 in 1940. This web site states that BC's historic 1940 run resulted in a split championship with the University of Minnesota, but it's not clear whether the selectors awarded BC a title at the time of the 1940 season, or if they did so retroactively. The NCAA lists only Minnesota (who finished No. 1 the final AP Poll) as the national champion in 1940, and does not credit Boston College with any national championships in football. \n\nParagraph 7: Filippo Brunelleschi proposed avoiding the problem of building an independent wooden scaffolding sufficiently strong to support the dome during construction, which may not have been possible, by using lower levels of the dome itself to support construction of higher levels. To demonstrate the idea, he built a dome without scaffolding over the Ridolfi chapel in the Church of San Jacopo sopr'Arno. Brunelleschi's plan to use suspended scaffolding for the workers won out over alternatives such as building a provisional stone support column in the center of the crossing or filling the space with earth, and he and Lorenzo Ghiberti were made joint leaders of the project to build the dome for Florence Cathedral in 1420. The octagonal brick domical vault was built between 1420 and 1436, with Ghiberti resigning in 1433. Brunelleschi's dome, designed in 1418, follows the height and form mandated in 1367. The dome can be described as a cloister vault, with the eight ribs at the angles concentrating weight on the supporting piers. The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells. A stairway winds between them. Eight white stone external ribs mark the edges of the eight sides, next to the red tile roofing, and extend from the base of the dome to the base of the cupola. Each of the eight sides of the dome also conceal a pair of intermediate stone ribs that are connected to the main ribs by means of a series of masonry rings. A temporary wooden tension ring still exists near the bottom of the dome. Three horizontal chains of sandstone blocks notched together and reinforced with lead-coated iron cramps also extend the entire circumference of the dome: one at the base (where radial struts from this chain protrude to the exterior), one a third of the way up the dome, and one two thirds of the way up the dome. Although generally preferred in Italy at the time, no visible internal ties were used. Only four major cracks have been observed on the inner dome, compared to about fourteen each on the domes of the Pantheon and St. Peter's Basilica. The design of the dome is very different from that of the Pantheon and it is unclear what the influences were, but it does share some similarities with earlier and smaller brick domes in Persia. The use of a herringbone pattern in the brick allowed for short horizontal sections of the layers of the dome to be completed as self-supporting units. Over 32 meters in height, it remains the largest masonry dome ever built.\n\nParagraph 8: A sequel to Celia, lo que dice (1929), the story narrates Celia's adventures following her father's decision to give in to her mother's wishes of sending their daughter to a convent school for girls.  At the school, Celia has many difficulties adapting to the strict rules of the nuns and is often reprimanded by Madre Loreto, whom Celia describes as \"very strict and scolds much\".  During her first days there, Celia is convinced that her father is not at all happy with the change and that he greatly misses his little girl, thus Celia tries to get herself expelled from the school by trying to make the nuns believe she has a sleepwalking problem.  Celia is unsuccessful, but she soon learns that though her father misses her, he is willing to allow her to stay at the school, which is good for Celia, who actually enjoys her new home.  Celia is the favorite among many of her classmates, but she does have many quarrels with a few other girls who find her behaviour disruptive and inappropriate.  Madre Isolina, an English nun Celia describes as \"very intelligent and understanding\" is Celia's favorite nun at the school because she sometimes helps her out of mischief.  Celia tries desperately to be good, she even wishes to become a saint.  The priest, Don Restituto, tries to guide Celia, but when the girl starts creating more trouble than usual in her attempt to become a saint, or at least a martyr, he gives up on her and forbids her from being either.  Following the end of the term, the other girls leave the convent, but Celia is left there with the nuns since her parents have left the country hoping to find a better job elsewhere and earn money to stabilize themselves economically.  Do\u00f1a Benita, the old lady that had looked after the girl for some time before, comes to the school and takes Celia with her for some time.  During those days, Celia and the old woman visit a circus, and from there Celia imagines all sorts of tales following her imaginary escape with the gypsies (tales she narrates in Celia, novelista).  In the summer, an elderly woman, Do\u00f1a Remedios, who is soon mocked and renamed Do\u00f1a Merlucines by Celia and some of the nuns and workers at the school, arrives and she and Celia become fast enemies.  Do\u00f1a Remedios, who is very kind to Celia at first, is soon irritated by the girl's wild ways and wishes she had more discipline.  After many quarrels between the two, Celia gets her revenge by filling the sleeping Do\u00f1a Remedios' bed with cockroaches.  Another schooling term begins and Celia's popularity with the other girl students begins to largely decrease.  One day, an angry T\u00edo Rodrigo, Celia's uncle, arrives at the school and demands to be allowed to take his niece away with him to her parents who currently reside in Paris.\n\nParagraph 9: Mount Olympus in the U.S. state of Utah is one of the most prominent and recognizable mountains viewable from practically every location in the Salt Lake Valley. Mount Olympus is not the tallest peak along the Wasatch Front, but its unusual form and location make it a popular hiking destination for locals. The mountain is situated immediately east of the center of the Salt Lake Valley (due east from Murray and Taylorsville). Distinctive features of the mountain are its twin peaks and other outcroppings, the highest of which is called \"Summit Peak\" and which towers above the valley to an elevation of . Thus, the peak looms about  above the valley floor.\n\nParagraph 10: In 1916, Selig sued George Fabyan on the grounds that profits from forthcoming films of Shakespeare's works, along with a film on \"The Life of Shakespeare\", would be damaged by Fabyan's assertion that Francis Bacon was the real author of Shakespeare's work, a popular claim at the time. He had already obtained an injunction stopping the publication of a book by Fabyan on the subject, in which Fabyan promoted the discovery of ciphers in Shakespeare's plays, identified in his private laboratory Fabyan Villa. Selig was hoping to capitalize on the celebrations organized for the upcoming 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, scheduled for April 1916. A Cook County Circuit Court judge, Richard Tuthill, found against Shakespeare. He determined that the ciphers identified by Fabyan's analyst Elizabeth Wells Gallup were authentic and that Francis Bacon was therefore the author of the works. Damages of $5,000 were awarded to Fabyan for the interference with the publication of the book. In the ensuing uproar, Tuthill rescinded his decision, and another judge, Judge Frederick A. Smith, dismissed the ruling. It was later suggested by the press that the case was concocted by both parties for publicity, since Selig and Fabyan were known to be old friends. An official of the Selig Company was quoted as saying, about the initial loss of the case, \"Isn't that sad.  That will be about nine million columns of publicity, won't it?\"\n\nParagraph 11: In 2001 Mocedades came back, recruited Luis Hornedo and Iratxe Martinez, and started performing live concerts in Spain and Latin America with some success, while they promoted themselves on the Internet. They recorded several Beatles covers which were never released. 2005 proved to be an annus horribilis for Mocedades, since three members from different phases of the group died in a matter of months, Rafael Blanco, Roberto Uranga and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Las Heras (who was still active in the group). He was replaced by a returning Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez. Iratxe left the group and the music business, and was replaced by Rosa Rodr\u00edguez. Mocedades, with Izaskun Uranga, Javier Garay, Luis Hornedo, Rosa Rodr\u00edguez and Fernando Gonzalez recorded a new album, \"Mocedades canta a Juan Luis Guerra\", with songs from the Dominican singer Juan Luis Guerra. This album was only released in Latin America and remains the only Mocedades album unreleased in Spain. In 2010, Fernando took a temporary leave and was replaced by Edorta Aiartzag\u00fcena for their successful tour through the US. Fernando came back after their return to Spain in 2011. In June 2012, Javier Garay announced an impending new album. The first two songs, \"Fue mentira\" and \"El diluvio universal\", are available on iTunes. Work on the album was halted, however, due to the sudden departure of Rosa Rodr\u00edguez and Fernando Gonzalez from the group at the end of 2012. Early in 2013 they were replaced by Bego\u00f1a Costa and Aitor Melgosa who participated in the group's 45th anniversary tour of Mexico. In June 2014, just after a successful tour of Mexico, Izaskun Uranga , the only member of the group who had never left it since its foundation as Las Hermanas Uranga, decided to leave the group and, since she also had the rights to use the name, she formed her own group also named Mocedades, with former members Rosa Rodr\u00edguez, Fernando Gonzalez, and Arsenio Gutierrez and new member Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Santa Mar\u00eda. In August 2014, after just two months with the new formation, Arsenio Gutierrez left and was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cort\u00e9s, who was himself replaced by Jos\u00e9 Miguel Robles a short while later. \n\nParagraph 12: Tenth Michigan Infantry. \u2014 Col., Charles M. Lum; Lieut. -Cols., Christopher J. Dickerson, William H. Dunphy; Majs., James J. Scarrett, Henry S. Burnett, Sylvan Ter Bush. This regiment was organized at Flint during the fall and winter of 1861-62 and was mustered in, Feb. 6, 1862. It left the state April 22, being ordered to Corinth, and was first in action at Farmington. It participated in the siege of Corinth; was engaged at Boonville in June; was then ordered to Nashville and assigned to the 1st brigade, and division, Rosecrans' army. It was engaged in provost, guard and fatigue duty at Nashville, Murfreesboro and on Stone's river during the year. On Dec. 31 it guarded an ammunition train for the army, made a march of  in 36 hours, and participated in the engagement at Stone's River (aka Battle of Murfreesboro, TN). On Jan. 3, 1863, Cos. A and D were attacked by a large force of guerrillas, but repulsed them, killing 15 and capturing as many more. On the 25th a squad guarding a train was captured by 200 of the enemy's cavalry. Twenty-seven men of the 10th being near, went forward and routed the enemy with heavy loss, capturing guns and horses and saving most of the train, which had been fired. On April 10 several hundred guerrillas drove a detail of 46 men away from the train they were guarding, but reinforced by 15 men, the guard returned and saved the train. In August and September the regiment joined in the march from Murfreesboro to Columbia, Stevenson, and Bridgeport, Ala., then moved to Anderson's cross-roads, thence to Smith's ferry, which place was reached Oct. 26. On Nov. 26 it participated in the capture of Chickamauga Station, and then moving towards Knoxville marched for several days, but was ordered to Columbus, reaching there Dec. 9. It moved for Chattanooga on the 15th and 395 having reenlisted as veterans on Feb. 6, 1864, they were expecting to receive the longed-for furlough, but instead on the 23d, the regiment was ordered to prepare for a movement into Georgia. The order was cheerfully obeyed and the regiment participated in the battle of Buzzard Roost, losing 13 killed, 36 wounded and 17 missing. It made a gallant advance over two sharp ridges, but being unsupported was compelled to return to its earlier stand. The 10th then took part in the successful counter attack at Tunnel Hill before being furloughed home in March and on its return reached Chattanooga May 11, in time to take part in the Atlanta campaign. It was engaged at Resaca, Rome and Dallas, was in reserve at Kennesaw mountain. When Confederate General John Bell Hood attacked in defense of Atlanta the 10th fought valiantly at Peach Tree Creek, as well as engagements at Sandtown, Red Oak, Rough and Ready, and at Jonesboro charged the enemy's works, taking 400 prisoners and a stand of colors, losing 30 killed and 47 wounded. It went into camp at Atlanta on Sept. 8, and on the 28th moved to Stevenson, Huntsville, Athens and Florence, skirmishing at the latter place. It proceeded to Chattanooga, thence to Rome, Ga., and moved forward with the army on the Savannah campaign, engaging in skirmishes at Sandersville and Louisville, four companies defeating a superior force at the latter place. The regiment reached Savannah Dec. 11 and moved into the city on the 21st. It then participated in the campaign of the Carolinas, being engaged with the enemy at Fayetteville, Averasboro, Southfield road and Bentonville. It reached Richmond May 7, was in the grand review at Washington, moved to Louisville, Ky., in June, and was mustered out on July 19. Its original strength was 997: gain by recruits, 791; total, 1,788. Loss by death, 299.\n\nParagraph 13:  The Water of Life was featured in Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics as part of its \"Grimm Masterpiece Theater\" season. One of the brothers is eliminated from the story, and the two remaining princes are named Joseph (the protagonist) and Franz (his treacherous eldest brother). Joseph's love interest is named Princess Anna. Additionally, the dwarf summons animals and the North Wind to ask them if they know where the Water can be found. The North Wind reveals its location to Joseph while the dwarf had previously banished Franz to the Valley of No Return due to his rudeness. The wand is replaced by the magic of the moonlight which Joseph uses to break the lock of the room containing Princess Anne, who is under attack by a demon who is destroyed by the moonlight. While Joseph collects the water, Anne flees the evil castle though picks up Joseph's broken sword which reveals to her the name of Joseph's kingdom. Joseph promises to court her once his father is well. While returning home, Joseph finds his injured brother Franz and heals him with the water. Despite being saved and healed by his brother, Franz conspires to switch the water with water from a nearby swamp as opposed to seawater. Instead of ordering Joseph's execution at first the king banishes him from the castle after being tricked by Franz, though he later orders the huntsman to kill Joseph after Franz convinces the King that Joseph will try to poison him again. Additionally, Joseph accepts his fate and asks his friend the huntsman who is also a knight to kill him as it is his duty as a knight to follow the king's orders. The huntsman instead convinces Joseph to flee the kingdom after refusing to kill him knowing that Joseph is innocent. He then delivers Joseph's clothes as 'evidence' that the deed is done, and then quits the king's service, stating that he can no longer serve the king after what he has done. Finally, it is Princess Anne who reveals Franz' treachery to his father when she appears at Franz' coronation to offer her hand in marriage believing it to be Joseph's coronation. Franz is apprehended by the palace guards when he attempts to flee as the heartbroken King explains to Anne that he had ordered Joseph's death, causing her to faint from a broken heart. While on the way home, Anna asks for some water as she continues to mourn the loss of Joseph and her carriage happens to stop at a nearby windmill where Joseph and the huntsman happen to be working. She recognizes Joseph by his voice and the two are happily reunited. The fate of Franz is never revealed and it is unclear if the King learns of his youngest son's survival.   \n\nParagraph 14: In addition, the Finnish Defence Force uses v\u00e4\u00e4peli to indicate an NCO position (which might or might not be occupied by an NCO of the rank v\u00e4\u00e4peli) subordinate to the company commander. The unit's v\u00e4\u00e4peli is in charge of the company's personnel management as well as supply, provisioning and maintenance, including the maintenance of the premises inhabited by the unit. They are also responsible for maintaining the general order, discipline and unit cohesion. The company's v\u00e4\u00e4peli is the lowest-ranking FDF position that can conduct a preliminary investigation into suspected service-related crimes. Their powers with regard to punishment are limited to conscripts, who they can punish with either a warning or up to 6 hours of extra duties.\n\nParagraph 15: Polo's acting debut, in 1987, was in the role of Kristin Larsen on the ABC daytime soap opera Loving. The following year, she earned a role in primetime on the short-lived CBS series TV 101. She also starred in the 1990 miniseries The Phantom of the Opera as Christine Daa\u00e9. In 1994, Polo became a regular cast member on the last season of Northern Exposure. She later played Detective Ash on the TV series Brimstone. She appeared in a recurring guest role in the sixth and seventh seasons of The West Wing playing the role of Helen Santos, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Matt Santos (Jimmy Smits).\n\nParagraph 16: Supply Belcher (March 29, 1751 \u2013 June 9, 1836) was an American composer, singer, and compiler of tune books. He was one of the so-called Yankee tunesmiths or First New England School, a group of mostly self-taught composers who created sacred vocal music for local choirs. He was active first in Lexington, Massachusetts, then eventually moved to Farmington, Maine. Like most of his colleagues, Belcher could not make music his main occupation, and worked as tax assessor, schoolmaster, town clerk, and so on; nevertheless he was considerably well known for his musical activities, and even dubbed 'the Handell [sic] of Maine' by a local newspaper. Most of his works survive in The Harmony of Maine, a collection Belcher published himself in Boston in 1794.\n\nParagraph 17: At the outbreak of World War I, nearly all the ships of the East Asia Station were dispersed at various island colonies on routine missions; the armored cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were at anchor at Ponape in the Carolines.  The fleet then rendezvoused at Pagan Island in the northern Marianas\u00a0\u2013 the commanders planning the logistics of their long journey to Germany, with the ships coaling.  The light cruiser N\u00fcrnberg was dispatched to Honolulu in the United States Territory of Hawaii to gather war news since all German undersea cables through British controlled areas were cut.  Admiral von Spee headed for German Samoa with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, then east, conducting the Bombardment of Papeete in French Polynesia. The East Asia Squadron coaled at Easter Island from colliers that had been on station throughout the Pacific. The unprotected cruiser , which had failed to rendezvous at Pagan, tried to join Spee's squadron until forced to intern itself at Hawaii on 17 October 1914 due to mechanical breakdowns. Realizing that Allied activity in the Pacific had increased to such a level that he was vastly outnumbered and losing the element of surprise, Admiral von Spee decided to move his fleet around Cape Horn into the Atlantic and force his way north in an effort to reach Germany. While off the coast of Chile, the squadron met up with the light cruiser , which had been operating as a commerce raider in the Atlantic and had rounded Cape Horn in an effort to increase chances of success. At this point, Dresden joined Spee's flag and set out with the rest of the East Asia Squadron.\n\nParagraph 18: Seacology was founded in 1991 by ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox and his wife Barbara in 1991 resulting from his efforts to preserve  of rainforest outside the village of Falealupo on the island of Savai'i in Samoa.  He later recorded these events in his book, Nafanua: Saving the Samoan Rain Forest.  Cox volunteered in Samoa for two years from 1973 to 1974 as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at which time he became fluent in common and chiefly Samoan, and deeply enamored of Samoan culture. After returning to Samoa for field work during his PhD studies in rain forest biology at Harvard University, and acquiring competency in Tongan and other Polynesian languages, Cox used funds from a Presidential Young Investigator Award given him by President Ronald Reagan to return with his young family to the remote island of Savaii in Samoa. His aim was to find a cure for metastatic breast cancer, which had claimed the life of his mother, scientist Rae G. Cox, earlier the previous year.  In return for the help of the local healers (called fofo), and with the permission of the local village chiefs and the Prime Minister of Samoa, Cox prevailed on his colleagues at the U. S. National Cancer Institute to share the revenue generated by his search for new drugs with the local villages and the Samoan government.  Over time, his research identified the therapeutic agent prostratin, a potential treatment for HIV.  Prostratin was isolated in a concoction made from the bark of the local mamala tree (Homalanthus nutans) and shared with him by a traditional healer named Epenesa Mauigoa, who used it to treat hepatitis.  Cox set up royalty agreements with the National Cancer Institute and Brigham Young University to ensure that the Samoans will share in any commercial development of the drug.\n\nParagraph 19: Farrell made his England d\u00e9but at Twickenham after he was named at inside centre in the first Six Nations game against Scotland. The 2007 World Cup saw Farrell starting at inside centre against South Africa, in England's chastening group stage defeat. He was then brought on as a replacement against Tonga, and scored his first England try. However, after being picked for the quarter-final decider against Australia he had to withdraw with a calf injury. Unfortunately he never produced the performances for the England union side for which many had hoped, and ultimately he won only eight caps. In January 2008 Farrell was joined at Saracens by his 16-year-old son Owen Farrell, who signed a three-year academy deal with the club. In August 2008 Farrell was named co-captain for the 2008\u201309 season along with Steve Borthwick. There were rumours of Farrell returning to rugby league and rejoining Wigan Warriors, after it emerged that Saracens head coach Eddie Jones had become unhappy with the direction his club was taking. It was rumoured that Jones and Farrell could be moving up north, with the Warriors becoming increasingly impatient with out-of-favour Brian Noble especially after their poor start to the season; however this proved to be unfounded, with the Warriors instead hiring Melbourne Storm assistant coach Michael Maguire. In April 2009 Farrell announced his retirement and said he was taking up a coaching role with Saracens at the end of the season.\n\nParagraph 20: The land that is now Oberhausen's municipal area was settled very early on. A few archaeological finds at barrows of the so-called \"Old Hunsr\u00fcck-Eifel Culture\", for instance a bronze torc and bronze armrings, are traces of human habitation from the time between 600 and 400\u00a0BC. Leading across what is now the municipal area were two important prehistoric roads, of which the so-called Salzstra\u00dfe (\"Salt Road\") linked the upper Nahe region with the Rhine and the other, a road from Kirchberg to Meisenheim, served as a north\u2013south link between the Moselle region and the North Palatine Uplands. Oberhausen's first documentary mentions are found in documents from 1342 (Obernhusen) and 1346. The latter is a Weistum (cognate with English wisdom, this was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times) in which the court Sch\u00f6ffe (roughly \"lay jurist\") \"Hermann von Obirnhusen\" is named as a member of the Hennweiler court's council of Sch\u00f6ffen. Oberhausen then belonged to the Vogtei of Heinzenberg, a mediaeval jurisdictional and administrative region formed of the villages of Hennweiler, Oberhausen, Guntzelnberg, Rode and Heinzenberg and the Eigener Hof (an estate). Here, the Lords of Heinzenberg, who lived at a castle in the Kellenbach valley, were responsible as V\u00f6gte for giving the law and for raising tax revenue. Hennweiler was the \"mother village\" in this greater municipal area, whereas Oberhausen was, like all the other outlying villages, a \"daughter village\" or an \"expansion settlement\". The Vogtei region was also a parochial region whose mother church was Saint Stephen's (Stephanuskirche) in Hennweiler. In the Late Middle Ages, Oberhausen became part of the Lordship of Wartenstein and belonged to the Unteramt of Hennweiler. It was then that power passed from the Lords of Heinzenberg, first to Tilmann vom Stein (or Wartenstein), but he died without having fathered any male offspring, and his power eventually passed over time, by marriage into other families of the lower nobility, to other lines. These families who had acquired Tilmann's holdings and rights in the Lordship of Wartenstein, formed a kind of Ganerbengemeinschaft, a form of condominium, whereby they ruled jointly. In the course of the earlier half of the 16th century, the Lords of Schwarzenberg eventually managed to secure their place as the sole lordship in the Unteramt of Hennweiler, although they had to be mindful that their overlords were still the Counts Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken (later Dukes of Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken), who were rightful successors to the Counts of Veldenz. As the village lord, Johann III of Schwarzenberg introduced the Reformation into the parish of Hennweiler/Oberhausen sometime about 1550. Oberhausen formed together with Hennweiler a greater municipal area in the Late Middle Ages that was run as a Markgenossenschaft\u00a0\u2013 a combined municipality with one administration and a single body of law. It was only later that the municipal area was split between the two villages. The villages' common woodlands were shared out as late as 1769. Beginning in 1798, Oberhausen lay under French rule, as did all the German lands on the Rhine's left bank. This lasted until the Napoleonic French were driven out in 1814. During this time, Oberhausen belonged to the Mairie (\"Mayoralty\") of Kirn in the Arrondissement of Simmern. After the Congress of Vienna had grouped the village into the Kingdom of Prussia, Oberhausen remained with the same mayoralty, although the German word B\u00fcrgermeisterei was now used for it. After Kirn was granted town rights in 1857, though, it together with the outlying villages formed a municipal body known as the Landb\u00fcrgermeisterei Kirn, which was headed by the mayor of Kirn. This \"personal union\" was dissolved in 1896, whereupon representatives of the rural villages chose their own B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor). Ever since, Oberhausen has remained in this municipal league of \"Kirn-Land\" without interruption, although in the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, it ceased to be an Amt in 1969 and became instead the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land. Over the last few decades, Oberhausen has grown from a mainly agriculturally orientated village into a modern residential community. Since 1953/1954, water has been supplied to the village by the Gruppenwasserwerk Krebsweiler (\"Krebsweiler Group Waterworks\"). Sewerage was laid between 1956 and 1963, and carries sewage to the treatment plant at Kirn.\n\nParagraph 21:  Jerry Church, Esper 2 (the \"2\" is struck through with a \"/\" in the original text) is an ostracized Esper who once helped Reich profit by reading the minds of business rivals.  He runs a pawn shop, from which Reich obtains the gun he uses to kill D'Courtney. Reich made millions from Church, but Church lost everything.  No Esper will even talk to him, let alone communicate with him telepathically.  At one point in the book, he stands outside Powell's house, eavesdropping on the Esper party inside, so great is his need for that kind of contact.  Powell detects him and offers him a drink, but Jerry resents his pity, throws it back at him and runs off.  After the murder, Jerry passes on information about Barbara D'Courtney's whereabouts to Keno Quizzard, leading Reich to find her at Chooka Frood's just as Powell, alerted by his own investigation, arrives.  Later, Keno's men attack his shop with him, Powell, and Tate inside.  Tate, foreseeing that his criminal involvement will be his undoing, commits suicide by allowing himself to be destroyed by the effects of the harmonic gun.  Powell persuades Jerry to turn against Reich, blaming him for the attack.  Jerry's testimony about the gun purchase is a vital piece of evidence.\n\nParagraph 22: The film begins with 40 thieves making huge robberies at various places of Baghdad and hiding their stolen treasure at a secret cave called Sesame. Once their Sardar  sends his acolyte Choto  with his daughter Marjiana to find out the wealthy people in the city. Alibaba is a young & energetic guy, sees the dance performance of Marjiana, develops an acquaintance with her and both of them fall in love. Alibaba & his mother Chandbibi  lives along with his elder brother Kasim Khan  a rich person but a huge miser and similarly, his wife Sultana is a shrew. They separate Alibaba and gives two donkeys for his livelihood, so, he decides to bring wood from the forest. Once Alibaba is cutting wood he observes the head of the thieves chanting some words of a cave door opens and when they come out and he chants some other words. Alibaba secretly enters into the cave, notices a lot of treasure, collects it and comes back. Now Alibaba becomes one of the richest person of Baghdad. Kasim Khan feels jealous about his brother's wealth, he silently knows regarding the secret treasure, reaches the cave and becomes flabbergasted. By the time, thieves arrive and catch him and learn his brother also knows this place. So, they take him to their fort and starts torturing him. Understanding the situation, Alibaba immediately rushes to the cave and finds out the route to the fort. But he also caught when Marjiana helps them to escape. Knowing it, Angered, Chotu tries to kill Marjiana but Sardar obstructs his way and dies. Alibaba brings his brother back, due to fear of the thieves he secretly brings the village doctor by blindfolding and keeping his brother in a dark room. After the treatment, while leaving, the clever doctor keeps a mark on the door. After that, Alibaba again goes to the thieves fort saves Marjiana and brings her home. Meanwhile, Kasim recovers, realize his mistake and says sorry to Alibaba. Parallelly, Chotu secretly meets the doctor and asks him to reveal whom he recently cured of deadly wounds. So, he shows the house which he has marked, but Marjiana observes it and cleverly makes the same mark on every house. Now Chotu decides to burn the entire village when Alibaba motivates the villagers to safeguard the village from 4 sides. So, Chotu makes a ploy, enters the village as an oil merchant along with 39 oil barrels in which the remaining thieves are hidden. Alibaba gives him a warm welcome when, fortunately, the oil is nill in their kitchen. So, Marjiana goes to collect some oil from the barrels where she finds out that the thieves are hidden in it. Now Alibaba makes a plan, secretly burns all the barrels. Angered Chotu captures Marjiana and runs away to the cave, Alibaba follows him and stamps out Chotu. At last, Alibaba distributes the entire treasure in the cave to the villagers. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Alibaba & Marjiana.\n\nParagraph 23: In the U.S., the community college training model remains the most common, although some university-based paramedic education models exist. These variations in both educational approaches and standards has led to tremendous differences from one location to another. There may be situations in which a group of people with 120 hours of training, and another group (in another jurisdiction) with university degrees, were both calling themselves 'paramedics'. There were some efforts made to resolve these discrepancies. The National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT) along with National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) attempted to create a national standard by means of a common licensing examination, but to this day, this has never been universally accepted by U.S. States, and issues of licensing reciprocity for paramedics continue, although if an EMT obtains certification through NREMT (NREMT-P, NREMT-I, NREMT-B), this is accepted by 40 of the 50 states in the United States. This confusion was further complicated by the introduction of complex systems of gradation of certification, reflecting levels of training and skill, but these too were, for the most part, purely local. To clarify, at least at a national level, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is the federal organization with authority to administer the EMS system, defines the various titles given to prehospital medical workers based on the level of care they provide. They are EMT-P (Paramedic), EMT-I (Intermediate), EMT-B (Basic), and First Responders. While providers at all levels are considered emergency medical technicians, the term \"paramedic\" is most properly used in the United States to refer only to those providers who are EMT-P's. Apart from this distinction, the only truly common trend that would evolve was the relatively universal acceptance of the term 'emergency medical technician' being used to denote a lower level of training and skill than a 'paramedic'.\n\nParagraph 24: Winrod wrote in his book The Jewish Assault on Christianity, published in 1935 by a publishing company in Topeka, Kansas: \"The same forces which crucified Christ nineteen hundred years ago are today trying to crucify His Church. Many Christian leaders have not yet realized it, but Christianity is in the grip of a life and death struggle at the present time. International Jewish Communism, which has already undermined all nations, firmly expects to exterminate all Christians. What the Cause of Christ has endured in Russia the past eighteen years, surpasses its suffering at the hands of bloody Nero. One of the purposes of the present treatise is to show that this conspiracy is not of recent origin.\" The book was met with positive reception by many Christians at the time. Winrod would go on to say that he believed Jews were damned to hell, and that Jesus Christ condemned them in the Bible. He expanded upon these views, being quoted, \"Will the Church be able to demonstrate sufficient power to triumph over its foes in the present crisis, or has it become so weakened by apostasy and pernicious teachings that it will have to be drenched in its own blood before it can be brought to its senses? Jesus knew better than anyone else the unspeakable crimes of which [the Jews] are capable. The Jesus of the twenty-third chapter of Matthew, is not the quiet, reticent Jesus of modern literature and the fashionable pulpit. The Jesus, whose righteous indignation is here asserted, is a man of words and action, a man in the act of pronouncing eight woes upon the Jewish leaders and finally condemning them to the damnation of hell.\" Winrod spread these views through his newspaper, The Defender, which by 1937 achieved a 100,000 monthly circulation. Some of the articles reproduced materials from the pro-Nazi and virulently antisemitic international Welt-Dienst/World-Service/Service Mondial news agency founded in 1933 by Ulrich Fleischhauer.\n\nParagraph 25: Eternal Masters is a Magic compilation set released in June 2016.  Similar to the Modern Masters sets, it reprints cards, but from all of Magics history rather than restricting itself to the Modern format, thus aiming itself at casual formats such as Cube as well as the Vintage and Legacy formats.Modern Masters 2017 Edition (\"MM3\") was released on March 17, 2017.  It was also released in English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese.  The 2017 edition added Innistrad block, Return to Ravnica block, Magic 2013, and Magic 2014 to the sets eligible for a Modern Masters reprint.  Notable reprints in Modern Masters 2017 Edition included Tarmogoyf, Damnation, Liliana of the Veil, Snapcaster Mage, Voice of Resurgence, and the enemy color \"fetchlands\" such as Scalding Tarn.Iconic Masters is a Magic compilation set; it was released at Hasbro's HasCon's 25th anniversary celebration of Magic in September 2017, and released to the wider public in November 2017.  It is a compilation set with reprinted cards originating throughout the history of Magic, similar to Eternal Masters.  The set is generally perceived to have had poor sales due to the two month delayed nature of its wide release, which happened only a few weeks before the release of Unstable.  Wizards of the Coast would later apologize for setting wrong expectations for the set as well as the strange scheduling after receiving negative feedback about the set.Masters 25 (A25) was released on March 16, 2018.  It was themed as a celebration of 25 years of the history of Magic, with cards from every printed set.Ultimate Masters (UMA) was released on December 7, 2018.  In the set's official announcement, it was noted that it would have an unusually high price point, but would contain unusually high-value reprints.  It is the first Magic set to include a regular-sized \"box topper\" promotional card with each booster box.  Wizards of the Coast announced that it would be the last Masters set for some time; however, Double Masters would be released less than two years later. Double Masters (2XM) was released on August 7, 2020.  Due to the \"double\" theme of the set, each draft booster contains two rare or mythic cards and two foil cards of any rarity, and each booster box contains two \"box topper\" promotional cards.  It is the first Masters set to be released without an official list price. \n\nParagraph 26: Electrification of the Southport route was begun in 1902. It was increasingly popular for commuting and pleasure trips, but suffered from competition from the Cheshire Lines Railway. Electric traction was seen as cleaner than steam locomotives, and with coal prices rising, potentially cheaper. At the time, concerns were being expressed, especially in the railway press, that engineering developments in Britain was being overtaken by electrification projects in America and Switzerland. Preston-based Dick, Kerr and Company was responsible for the traction systems and the L&YR built the rolling stock. A 625 V DC four-rail system was adopted. A live rail was outside the running rails  from the centre of the track and  above the top of the running rails. A return rail, cross-bonded to the running rails, was positioned centrally between the tracks. The route was  long and gaps were left at 46 level crossings. The L&YR built a power station at Formby, generating 7.5 kV AC, conveyed to four sub-stations by underground cables.\n\nParagraph 27: In the 2,398th match played at the ground, with both sides looking to qualify for European football in the 2016\u201317 season, in front of a crowd of 34,907, West Ham took the lead in the tenth minute through Diafra Sakho, only for Manchester United to make the score 1\u20132 with two goals from Anthony Martial. However, Michail Antonio equalized for West Ham and Winston Reid scored a third in the 80th minute to make it 3\u20132, the final score. It was West Ham's 384th Premier League match, their 990th in the top division, and their 1,662nd ever league match at the ground, the win signifying 601 home Premier League points won there. Mark Noble was named Man of the Match. The match was followed by a 45-minute display on the pitch in celebration of the history of the ground. The following day, the club condemned the violence aimed at the Manchester United coach, vowing to ban for life any person convicted. Three people were arrested on the night of the game, two for pitch incursion and one for throwing a bottle at the police. The following day, the Metropolitan Police issued pictures of four men they hoped to identify in connection with the coach attack.\n\nParagraph 28: The CPU die contains the majority of logic, all of the execution units and a level 0 (L0) instruction cache. The execution units consist of two integer units, address units, floating-point units (FPUs), memory units. The FPU hardware consists of a fused multiply add (FMA) unit and a divide unit. But the FMA instructions are really fused (that is, with a single rounding) only as of SPARC64 VI. The FMA unit is pipelined and has a four-cycle latency and a one-cycle-throughput. The divide unit is not pipelined and has significantly longer latencies. The L0 instruction cache has a capacity of 4\u00a0KB, is direct-mapped and has a one-cycle latency.\n\nParagraph 29: Peel began playing for Yorkshire in 1883 but, after a successful debut, was overshadowed in the team by Edmund Peate and often played only a minor role with the ball. Improvements in his batting and his excellence as a fielder kept him in the team, and when Peate was sacked for drunkenness in 1887, Peel became Yorkshire's main spinner. He had already played for England, touring Australia with two professional teams, although he did not play a Test in England until 1888. Over the following years he regularly took over 100 wickets in each season and often played in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players matches. He was generally Yorkshire's leading bowler\u2014until the emergence of George Hirst, he generally received little support from other members of the attack\u2014and often among their leading batsmen. His best season in county cricket came in 1896, when he recorded the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets, and made his highest first-class score of 210. Among his notable feats in Tests, he bowled England to victory after they had followed on in Australia in 1894\u201395 and took six for 23 in his final Test. The first English cricketer to reach 100 wickets against Australia, in 1894\u201395 he also became the first player to fail to score in four successive Test innings.\n\nParagraph 30: Chemical industries such as Aarti, Supreet Chemicals, and textile giants such as Alok industries, Welspun Terry Towels, Century Textiles, GHCL and Raymonds Limited have strong presences in Vapi and nearby areas. Bayer Vapi Pvt Ltd, United Phosphorus Ltd., Supreet Chemicals Pvt Ltd., Sarna Chemicals, Sangir Plastics, Kampun Polymers, Lathia Rubbers, Arti Industries Ltd., Themis Industries and Hubergroup India Pvt Ltd (formerly Micro Inks Limited), operate manufacturing plants in Vapi. Today, about 70% of the total industries in the township are chemical plants, mainly for chemical distillation and the production of pesticides, dyes, dye intermediaries and paints. Other major industries include paper, packaging, pharmaceuticals, plastics, rubber, textiles, wood, computer hardware and software, engineering workshops, glass, and food products. Another striking feature of Vapi is the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (or CETP). This is the largest of its kind in Asia and one of India's biggest effluent treatment plants in terms of capacity, treating the pollutants from these industries before the effluent is released into the river. The CETP is run by Vapi Waste and Effluent Management Company, promoted by the Vapi Industries Association. Vapi has the maximum number of Kraft paper & duplex board paper mills in India. The best quality paper producers are located in Vapi and to have more than 20 kraft paper mills within a distance of 20 km. Therefore, Vapi is also known as \"paper hub\".\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text discusses a book written by a man named Winrod in 1935 called \"The Jewish Assault on Christianity.\" The book claims that the same forces that crucified Jesus Christ are now trying to destroy the Christian Church. Winrod argues that international Jewish Communism aims to exterminate all Christians and that this conspiracy is not new. The book received positive reception among Christians at the time. Winrod also expressed beliefs that Jews were damned to hell and that Jesus Christ condemned them in the Bible. He spread these views through his newspaper, The Defender, which had a monthly circulation of 100,000 by 1937. It is also mentioned that some of the articles in the newspaper reproduced materials from an antisemitic news agency founded by Ulrich Fleischhauer.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from. The answer format must be like \"Paragraph 1\", \"Paragraph 2\", etc.\n\nThe answer is: ", "input": "The text discusses a book written by a man named Winrod in 1935 called \"The Jewish Assault on Christianity.\" The book claims that the same forces that crucified Jesus Christ are now trying to destroy the Christian Church.

The food is high in butter and fat while staying low in spices except for black pepper, dill or grains/seeds, such as caraway seeds. Latvian cuisine originated from the peasant culture and is strongly based on crops that grow in Latvia's maritime, temperate climate. Rye or wheat, oats, peas, beets, cabbage, pork products, and potatoes are the staples. Latvian cuisine offers plenty of varieties of bread and dairy products, which are an important part of the cuisine. Meat features in most main meal dishes, but fish also is commonly consumed, especially in the coastal areas next to Baltic Sea. Both are also smoked.\n\nParagraph 2: Two branches on the line north of New Brunswick were built, one to Carteret and one towards Perth Amboy, both merging towards the north. The Carteret branch used shuttle operations, with a transfer at the junction with the mainline, but Perth Amboy trains ran all the way to Newark. On the Perth Amboy end, they used existing trackage from the end of private right-of-way along Woodbridge Avenue, East Avenue, Broad Street, private right-of-way south, west across West Avenue, and south along the east side of the CNJ line to the Woodbridge Creek bridge, then south on West Avenue and State Street, ending at Smith Street.\n\nParagraph 3: Elvis Presley was an American entertainer who achieved great initial success as a singer and stage performer. He publicly expressed an early career goal of following in the footsteps of his role models James Dean and Marlon Brando to become a top dramatic actor. His manager Colonel Tom Parker's persistent lobbying of William Morris Agency president Abe Lastfogel for a Presley screen test paid off on March 26, 1956, when the singer auditioned at Paramount for a supporting role in The Rainmaker. Although not chosen for the part, he signed a contract with Paramount producer Hal Wallis on April 25 that also allowed him to make films with other studios.\n\nParagraph 4: Tosh becomes pregnant through the insemination and they announce this at Stan's birthday party, although she loses the baby soon after. Depressed at this, Tosh accepts Tina's nephew Dean Wicks' (Matt Di Angelo) offer of being a sperm donor, without Tina's knowledge or consent. Tina is angry when she finds out, but forgives Tosh and supports her when she discovers she is not pregnant again. They fall out when Tosh accuses her of not wanting a baby, and Tosh punches her after taunting her. Tina again forgives her and decides to try and reconcile Tosh with her family by arranging a lunch for them. Her mother Judy (Jo Martin) comes, but her father makes an excuse, uncomfortable with Tosh's sexuality due to his Christian faith. Judy storms out when Tina tells her about their attempts to have a baby, upsetting Tosh further. Tina is devastated when Stan reveals that he is dying from prostate cancer, and is even more upset when she learns that Stan knew about his illness 3 years prior to him telling the family. She and Tosh urge Stan to see a private doctor, however he reveals that Stan's cancer is too aggressive to be cured, which leaves Tina distraught. Tina supports Sonia when she falls ill, and she confides in her that she spent the money from the charity calendar she organised on a gastric band in Bulgaria, to impress her husband Martin (James Bye). Tosh returns home while Sonia is hiding in Tina's room, but she manages to sneak out before Tosh realizes. When Martin fails to turn up to the Christmas party for Sonia's group \"Fat Blasters\", Sonia decides to announce her actions but Tina urges her not to; however, before she can, she collapses. When the paramedics arrive, Tina reveals Sonia has had an operation to fit a gastric band, which shocks Carol and Martin. Babe leads Tosh to believe that Tina is having an affair with Sonia and when Tina denies this, Tosh viciously beats her. The next day, Tina decides that she cannot forgive Tosh for what she has done and thinks it best to move back to the Vic, while Tosh leaves Walford when Tina breaks up with her. Mick stops Tina assisting Stan's requested suicide. Tina is devastated by Stan's death and delivers the eulogy. Tina and Sonia become partners, splitting up briefly when Tina finds out Sonia cheated with her estranged husband Martin. They reconcile when Sonia helps Linda after she goes into premature labour.\n\nParagraph 5: The 2011 prize was judged by Rick Gekoski (Chair), Carmen Callil (withdrew in protest over choice of winner) and Justin Cartwright. The nominees for the fourth Man Booker International Prize were announced on 30 March 2011 at a ceremony in Sydney, Australia. John le Carr\u00e9 asked to be removed from consideration, saying he was \"flattered\", but that he does not compete for literary prizes. However, judge Dr Rick Gekoski said although he was disappointed that le Carr\u00e9 wanted to withdraw, his name would remain on the list. American novelist Roth was announced as the winner on 18 May 2011 at the Sydney Writers' Festival. Of his win, Roth said \"This is a great honour and I'm delighted to receive it.\" The writer said he hoped the prize would bring him to the attention of readers around the world who are not currently familiar with his body of work. Roth received his award in London on 28 June; however, he was unable to attend in person due to ill health, so he sent a short video instead. After Roth was announced as the winner, Carmen Callil withdrew from the judging panel, saying \"I don't rate him as a writer at all... in 20 years' time will anyone read him?\" Callil later wrote an editorial in The Guardian explaining her position and why she chose to leave the panel.\n\nParagraph 6: The 1940 season can arguably be called the greatest year in the history of Boston College football. BC's undefeated (11\u20130) and untied team, captured the 1941 Sugar Bowl championship and earned the nickname \"Team of Destiny\". Five members of that storied team have been inducted into the National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame: receiver Gene Goodreault (50); guard George Kerr (47); center Chet Gladchuk (45); fullback Mike Holovak (12); and halfback / quarterback Charlie O'Rourke (13). It included a 19\u201318 victory over No. 9 Georgetown before 41,700 fans at sold-out Fenway Park, that was called one of the greatest games ever by famed sportswriter Grantland Rice. Going into the game, the Hoyas had 22 consecutive victories spanning three seasons. BC trailed until the third quarter, when a 43-yard touchdown pass from Charlie O'Rourke to Monk Maznicki put the Eagles ahead. With just seconds remaining, BC had the ball on their own nine, fourth down and 18 to go. Georgetown set up to return the Eagles' punt. Instead of punting, O'Rourke scrambled in his own end zone for 45 seconds then took a safety. BC used the free kick to boot the ball far downfield and dashed the Hoyas' three-season unbeaten record. Legendary Coach Frank Leahy, who would go on to cement his legendary status during an eleven-year stint as head coach at Notre Dame, took his undefeated Eagles on to the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans where they beat No. 4 Tennessee 19\u201313. Trailing 7\u201313 in the fourth quarter, Tennessee's Bob Foxx missed a short field goal attempt with three minutes remaining, and Boston College took over on its own 20\u2013yard line. Quarterback Charlie O'Rourke led the Eagles on an eighty-yard drive, capped with his 24-yard touchdown run to seal the victory. A banner on campus commemorating the team uses the phrase \"national champions\", but Boston College was not awarded a national championship by any of the national polls at the time of the 1940 season. Although BC's claim to a title is not recognized by the NCAA or college football historians in general, one website, the College Football Data Warehouse, claims that selectors named Cliff Morgan and Ray Bryne rated BC No. 1 in 1940. This web site states that BC's historic 1940 run resulted in a split championship with the University of Minnesota, but it's not clear whether the selectors awarded BC a title at the time of the 1940 season, or if they did so retroactively. The NCAA lists only Minnesota (who finished No. 1 the final AP Poll) as the national champion in 1940, and does not credit Boston College with any national championships in football. \n\nParagraph 7: Filippo Brunelleschi proposed avoiding the problem of building an independent wooden scaffolding sufficiently strong to support the dome during construction, which may not have been possible, by using lower levels of the dome itself to support construction of higher levels. To demonstrate the idea, he built a dome without scaffolding over the Ridolfi chapel in the Church of San Jacopo sopr'Arno. Brunelleschi's plan to use suspended scaffolding for the workers won out over alternatives such as building a provisional stone support column in the center of the crossing or filling the space with earth, and he and Lorenzo Ghiberti were made joint leaders of the project to build the dome for Florence Cathedral in 1420. The octagonal brick domical vault was built between 1420 and 1436, with Ghiberti resigning in 1433. Brunelleschi's dome, designed in 1418, follows the height and form mandated in 1367. The dome can be described as a cloister vault, with the eight ribs at the angles concentrating weight on the supporting piers. The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells. A stairway winds between them. Eight white stone external ribs mark the edges of the eight sides, next to the red tile roofing, and extend from the base of the dome to the base of the cupola. Each of the eight sides of the dome also conceal a pair of intermediate stone ribs that are connected to the main ribs by means of a series of masonry rings. A temporary wooden tension ring still exists near the bottom of the dome. Three horizontal chains of sandstone blocks notched together and reinforced with lead-coated iron cramps also extend the entire circumference of the dome: one at the base (where radial struts from this chain protrude to the exterior), one a third of the way up the dome, and one two thirds of the way up the dome. Although generally preferred in Italy at the time, no visible internal ties were used. Only four major cracks have been observed on the inner dome, compared to about fourteen each on the domes of the Pantheon and St. Peter's Basilica. The design of the dome is very different from that of the Pantheon and it is unclear what the influences were, but it does share some similarities with earlier and smaller brick domes in Persia. The use of a herringbone pattern in the brick allowed for short horizontal sections of the layers of the dome to be completed as self-supporting units. Over 32 meters in height, it remains the largest masonry dome ever built.\n\nParagraph 8: A sequel to Celia, lo que dice (1929), the story narrates Celia's adventures following her father's decision to give in to her mother's wishes of sending their daughter to a convent school for girls.  At the school, Celia has many difficulties adapting to the strict rules of the nuns and is often reprimanded by Madre Loreto, whom Celia describes as \"very strict and scolds much\".  During her first days there, Celia is convinced that her father is not at all happy with the change and that he greatly misses his little girl, thus Celia tries to get herself expelled from the school by trying to make the nuns believe she has a sleepwalking problem.  Celia is unsuccessful, but she soon learns that though her father misses her, he is willing to allow her to stay at the school, which is good for Celia, who actually enjoys her new home.  Celia is the favorite among many of her classmates, but she does have many quarrels with a few other girls who find her behaviour disruptive and inappropriate.  Madre Isolina, an English nun Celia describes as \"very intelligent and understanding\" is Celia's favorite nun at the school because she sometimes helps her out of mischief.  Celia tries desperately to be good, she even wishes to become a saint.  The priest, Don Restituto, tries to guide Celia, but when the girl starts creating more trouble than usual in her attempt to become a saint, or at least a martyr, he gives up on her and forbids her from being either.  Following the end of the term, the other girls leave the convent, but Celia is left there with the nuns since her parents have left the country hoping to find a better job elsewhere and earn money to stabilize themselves economically.  Do\u00f1a Benita, the old lady that had looked after the girl for some time before, comes to the school and takes Celia with her for some time.  During those days, Celia and the old woman visit a circus, and from there Celia imagines all sorts of tales following her imaginary escape with the gypsies (tales she narrates in Celia, novelista).  In the summer, an elderly woman, Do\u00f1a Remedios, who is soon mocked and renamed Do\u00f1a Merlucines by Celia and some of the nuns and workers at the school, arrives and she and Celia become fast enemies.  Do\u00f1a Remedios, who is very kind to Celia at first, is soon irritated by the girl's wild ways and wishes she had more discipline.  After many quarrels between the two, Celia gets her revenge by filling the sleeping Do\u00f1a Remedios' bed with cockroaches.  Another schooling term begins and Celia's popularity with the other girl students begins to largely decrease.  One day, an angry T\u00edo Rodrigo, Celia's uncle, arrives at the school and demands to be allowed to take his niece away with him to her parents who currently reside in Paris.\n\nParagraph 9: Mount Olympus in the U.S. state of Utah is one of the most prominent and recognizable mountains viewable from practically every location in the Salt Lake Valley. Mount Olympus is not the tallest peak along the Wasatch Front, but its unusual form and location make it a popular hiking destination for locals. The mountain is situated immediately east of the center of the Salt Lake Valley (due east from Murray and Taylorsville). Distinctive features of the mountain are its twin peaks and other outcroppings, the highest of which is called \"Summit Peak\" and which towers above the valley to an elevation of . Thus, the peak looms about  above the valley floor.\n\nParagraph 10: In 1916, Selig sued George Fabyan on the grounds that profits from forthcoming films of Shakespeare's works, along with a film on \"The Life of Shakespeare\", would be damaged by Fabyan's assertion that Francis Bacon was the real author of Shakespeare's work, a popular claim at the time. He had already obtained an injunction stopping the publication of a book by Fabyan on the subject, in which Fabyan promoted the discovery of ciphers in Shakespeare's plays, identified in his private laboratory Fabyan Villa. Selig was hoping to capitalize on the celebrations organized for the upcoming 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, scheduled for April 1916. A Cook County Circuit Court judge, Richard Tuthill, found against Shakespeare. He determined that the ciphers identified by Fabyan's analyst Elizabeth Wells Gallup were authentic and that Francis Bacon was therefore the author of the works. Damages of $5,000 were awarded to Fabyan for the interference with the publication of the book. In the ensuing uproar, Tuthill rescinded his decision, and another judge, Judge Frederick A. Smith, dismissed the ruling. It was later suggested by the press that the case was concocted by both parties for publicity, since Selig and Fabyan were known to be old friends. An official of the Selig Company was quoted as saying, about the initial loss of the case, \"Isn't that sad.  That will be about nine million columns of publicity, won't it?\"\n\nParagraph 11: In 2001 Mocedades came back, recruited Luis Hornedo and Iratxe Martinez, and started performing live concerts in Spain and Latin America with some success, while they promoted themselves on the Internet. They recorded several Beatles covers which were never released. 2005 proved to be an annus horribilis for Mocedades, since three members from different phases of the group died in a matter of months, Rafael Blanco, Roberto Uranga and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Las Heras (who was still active in the group). He was replaced by a returning Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez. Iratxe left the group and the music business, and was replaced by Rosa Rodr\u00edguez. Mocedades, with Izaskun Uranga, Javier Garay, Luis Hornedo, Rosa Rodr\u00edguez and Fernando Gonzalez recorded a new album, \"Mocedades canta a Juan Luis Guerra\", with songs from the Dominican singer Juan Luis Guerra. This album was only released in Latin America and remains the only Mocedades album unreleased in Spain. In 2010, Fernando took a temporary leave and was replaced by Edorta Aiartzag\u00fcena for their successful tour through the US. Fernando came back after their return to Spain in 2011. In June 2012, Javier Garay announced an impending new album. The first two songs, \"Fue mentira\" and \"El diluvio universal\", are available on iTunes. Work on the album was halted, however, due to the sudden departure of Rosa Rodr\u00edguez and Fernando Gonzalez from the group at the end of 2012. Early in 2013 they were replaced by Bego\u00f1a Costa and Aitor Melgosa who participated in the group's 45th anniversary tour of Mexico. In June 2014, just after a successful tour of Mexico, Izaskun Uranga , the only member of the group who had never left it since its foundation as Las Hermanas Uranga, decided to leave the group and, since she also had the rights to use the name, she formed her own group also named Mocedades, with former members Rosa Rodr\u00edguez, Fernando Gonzalez, and Arsenio Gutierrez and new member Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Santa Mar\u00eda. In August 2014, after just two months with the new formation, Arsenio Gutierrez left and was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cort\u00e9s, who was himself replaced by Jos\u00e9 Miguel Robles a short while later. \n\nParagraph 12: Tenth Michigan Infantry. \u2014 Col., Charles M. Lum; Lieut. -Cols., Christopher J. Dickerson, William H. Dunphy; Majs., James J. Scarrett, Henry S. Burnett, Sylvan Ter Bush. This regiment was organized at Flint during the fall and winter of 1861-62 and was mustered in, Feb. 6, 1862. It left the state April 22, being ordered to Corinth, and was first in action at Farmington. It participated in the siege of Corinth; was engaged at Boonville in June; was then ordered to Nashville and assigned to the 1st brigade, and division, Rosecrans' army. It was engaged in provost, guard and fatigue duty at Nashville, Murfreesboro and on Stone's river during the year. On Dec. 31 it guarded an ammunition train for the army, made a march of  in 36 hours, and participated in the engagement at Stone's River (aka Battle of Murfreesboro, TN). On Jan. 3, 1863, Cos. A and D were attacked by a large force of guerrillas, but repulsed them, killing 15 and capturing as many more. On the 25th a squad guarding a train was captured by 200 of the enemy's cavalry. Twenty-seven men of the 10th being near, went forward and routed the enemy with heavy loss, capturing guns and horses and saving most of the train, which had been fired. On April 10 several hundred guerrillas drove a detail of 46 men away from the train they were guarding, but reinforced by 15 men, the guard returned and saved the train. In August and September the regiment joined in the march from Murfreesboro to Columbia, Stevenson, and Bridgeport, Ala., then moved to Anderson's cross-roads, thence to Smith's ferry, which place was reached Oct. 26. On Nov. 26 it participated in the capture of Chickamauga Station, and then moving towards Knoxville marched for several days, but was ordered to Columbus, reaching there Dec. 9. It moved for Chattanooga on the 15th and 395 having reenlisted as veterans on Feb. 6, 1864, they were expecting to receive the longed-for furlough, but instead on the 23d, the regiment was ordered to prepare for a movement into Georgia. The order was cheerfully obeyed and the regiment participated in the battle of Buzzard Roost, losing 13 killed, 36 wounded and 17 missing. It made a gallant advance over two sharp ridges, but being unsupported was compelled to return to its earlier stand. The 10th then took part in the successful counter attack at Tunnel Hill before being furloughed home in March and on its return reached Chattanooga May 11, in time to take part in the Atlanta campaign. It was engaged at Resaca, Rome and Dallas, was in reserve at Kennesaw mountain. When Confederate General John Bell Hood attacked in defense of Atlanta the 10th fought valiantly at Peach Tree Creek, as well as engagements at Sandtown, Red Oak, Rough and Ready, and at Jonesboro charged the enemy's works, taking 400 prisoners and a stand of colors, losing 30 killed and 47 wounded. It went into camp at Atlanta on Sept. 8, and on the 28th moved to Stevenson, Huntsville, Athens and Florence, skirmishing at the latter place. It proceeded to Chattanooga, thence to Rome, Ga., and moved forward with the army on the Savannah campaign, engaging in skirmishes at Sandersville and Louisville, four companies defeating a superior force at the latter place. The regiment reached Savannah Dec. 11 and moved into the city on the 21st. It then participated in the campaign of the Carolinas, being engaged with the enemy at Fayetteville, Averasboro, Southfield road and Bentonville. It reached Richmond May 7, was in the grand review at Washington, moved to Louisville, Ky., in June, and was mustered out on July 19. Its original strength was 997: gain by recruits, 791; total, 1,788. Loss by death, 299.\n\nParagraph 13:  The Water of Life was featured in Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics as part of its \"Grimm Masterpiece Theater\" season. One of the brothers is eliminated from the story, and the two remaining princes are named Joseph (the protagonist) and Franz (his treacherous eldest brother). Joseph's love interest is named Princess Anna. Additionally, the dwarf summons animals and the North Wind to ask them if they know where the Water can be found. The North Wind reveals its location to Joseph while the dwarf had previously banished Franz to the Valley of No Return due to his rudeness. The wand is replaced by the magic of the moonlight which Joseph uses to break the lock of the room containing Princess Anne, who is under attack by a demon who is destroyed by the moonlight. While Joseph collects the water, Anne flees the evil castle though picks up Joseph's broken sword which reveals to her the name of Joseph's kingdom. Joseph promises to court her once his father is well. While returning home, Joseph finds his injured brother Franz and heals him with the water. Despite being saved and healed by his brother, Franz conspires to switch the water with water from a nearby swamp as opposed to seawater. Instead of ordering Joseph's execution at first the king banishes him from the castle after being tricked by Franz, though he later orders the huntsman to kill Joseph after Franz convinces the King that Joseph will try to poison him again. Additionally, Joseph accepts his fate and asks his friend the huntsman who is also a knight to kill him as it is his duty as a knight to follow the king's orders. The huntsman instead convinces Joseph to flee the kingdom after refusing to kill him knowing that Joseph is innocent. He then delivers Joseph's clothes as 'evidence' that the deed is done, and then quits the king's service, stating that he can no longer serve the king after what he has done. Finally, it is Princess Anne who reveals Franz' treachery to his father when she appears at Franz' coronation to offer her hand in marriage believing it to be Joseph's coronation. Franz is apprehended by the palace guards when he attempts to flee as the heartbroken King explains to Anne that he had ordered Joseph's death, causing her to faint from a broken heart. While on the way home, Anna asks for some water as she continues to mourn the loss of Joseph and her carriage happens to stop at a nearby windmill where Joseph and the huntsman happen to be working. She recognizes Joseph by his voice and the two are happily reunited. The fate of Franz is never revealed and it is unclear if the King learns of his youngest son's survival.   \n\nParagraph 14: In addition, the Finnish Defence Force uses v\u00e4\u00e4peli to indicate an NCO position (which might or might not be occupied by an NCO of the rank v\u00e4\u00e4peli) subordinate to the company commander. The unit's v\u00e4\u00e4peli is in charge of the company's personnel management as well as supply, provisioning and maintenance, including the maintenance of the premises inhabited by the unit. They are also responsible for maintaining the general order, discipline and unit cohesion. The company's v\u00e4\u00e4peli is the lowest-ranking FDF position that can conduct a preliminary investigation into suspected service-related crimes. Their powers with regard to punishment are limited to conscripts, who they can punish with either a warning or up to 6 hours of extra duties.\n\nParagraph 15: Polo's acting debut, in 1987, was in the role of Kristin Larsen on the ABC daytime soap opera Loving. The following year, she earned a role in primetime on the short-lived CBS series TV 101. She also starred in the 1990 miniseries The Phantom of the Opera as Christine Daa\u00e9. In 1994, Polo became a regular cast member on the last season of Northern Exposure. She later played Detective Ash on the TV series Brimstone. She appeared in a recurring guest role in the sixth and seventh seasons of The West Wing playing the role of Helen Santos, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Matt Santos (Jimmy Smits).\n\nParagraph 16: Supply Belcher (March 29, 1751 \u2013 June 9, 1836) was an American composer, singer, and compiler of tune books. He was one of the so-called Yankee tunesmiths or First New England School, a group of mostly self-taught composers who created sacred vocal music for local choirs. He was active first in Lexington, Massachusetts, then eventually moved to Farmington, Maine. Like most of his colleagues, Belcher could not make music his main occupation, and worked as tax assessor, schoolmaster, town clerk, and so on; nevertheless he was considerably well known for his musical activities, and even dubbed 'the Handell [sic] of Maine' by a local newspaper. Most of his works survive in The Harmony of Maine, a collection Belcher published himself in Boston in 1794.\n\nParagraph 17: At the outbreak of World War I, nearly all the ships of the East Asia Station were dispersed at various island colonies on routine missions; the armored cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were at anchor at Ponape in the Carolines.  The fleet then rendezvoused at Pagan Island in the northern Marianas\u00a0\u2013 the commanders planning the logistics of their long journey to Germany, with the ships coaling.  The light cruiser N\u00fcrnberg was dispatched to Honolulu in the United States Territory of Hawaii to gather war news since all German undersea cables through British controlled areas were cut.  Admiral von Spee headed for German Samoa with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, then east, conducting the Bombardment of Papeete in French Polynesia. The East Asia Squadron coaled at Easter Island from colliers that had been on station throughout the Pacific. The unprotected cruiser , which had failed to rendezvous at Pagan, tried to join Spee's squadron until forced to intern itself at Hawaii on 17 October 1914 due to mechanical breakdowns. Realizing that Allied activity in the Pacific had increased to such a level that he was vastly outnumbered and losing the element of surprise, Admiral von Spee decided to move his fleet around Cape Horn into the Atlantic and force his way north in an effort to reach Germany. While off the coast of Chile, the squadron met up with the light cruiser , which had been operating as a commerce raider in the Atlantic and had rounded Cape Horn in an effort to increase chances of success. At this point, Dresden joined Spee's flag and set out with the rest of the East Asia Squadron.\n\nParagraph 18: Seacology was founded in 1991 by ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox and his wife Barbara in 1991 resulting from his efforts to preserve  of rainforest outside the village of Falealupo on the island of Savai'i in Samoa.  He later recorded these events in his book, Nafanua: Saving the Samoan Rain Forest.  Cox volunteered in Samoa for two years from 1973 to 1974 as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at which time he became fluent in common and chiefly Samoan, and deeply enamored of Samoan culture. After returning to Samoa for field work during his PhD studies in rain forest biology at Harvard University, and acquiring competency in Tongan and other Polynesian languages, Cox used funds from a Presidential Young Investigator Award given him by President Ronald Reagan to return with his young family to the remote island of Savaii in Samoa. His aim was to find a cure for metastatic breast cancer, which had claimed the life of his mother, scientist Rae G. Cox, earlier the previous year.  In return for the help of the local healers (called fofo), and with the permission of the local village chiefs and the Prime Minister of Samoa, Cox prevailed on his colleagues at the U. S. National Cancer Institute to share the revenue generated by his search for new drugs with the local villages and the Samoan government.  Over time, his research identified the therapeutic agent prostratin, a potential treatment for HIV.  Prostratin was isolated in a concoction made from the bark of the local mamala tree (Homalanthus nutans) and shared with him by a traditional healer named Epenesa Mauigoa, who used it to treat hepatitis.  Cox set up royalty agreements with the National Cancer Institute and Brigham Young University to ensure that the Samoans will share in any commercial development of the drug.\n\nParagraph 19: Farrell made his England d\u00e9but at Twickenham after he was named at inside centre in the first Six Nations game against Scotland. The 2007 World Cup saw Farrell starting at inside centre against South Africa, in England's chastening group stage defeat. He was then brought on as a replacement against Tonga, and scored his first England try. However, after being picked for the quarter-final decider against Australia he had to withdraw with a calf injury. Unfortunately he never produced the performances for the England union side for which many had hoped, and ultimately he won only eight caps. In January 2008 Farrell was joined at Saracens by his 16-year-old son Owen Farrell, who signed a three-year academy deal with the club. In August 2008 Farrell was named co-captain for the 2008\u201309 season along with Steve Borthwick. There were rumours of Farrell returning to rugby league and rejoining Wigan Warriors, after it emerged that Saracens head coach Eddie Jones had become unhappy with the direction his club was taking. It was rumoured that Jones and Farrell could be moving up north, with the Warriors becoming increasingly impatient with out-of-favour Brian Noble especially after their poor start to the season; however this proved to be unfounded, with the Warriors instead hiring Melbourne Storm assistant coach Michael Maguire. In April 2009 Farrell announced his retirement and said he was taking up a coaching role with Saracens at the end of the season.\n\nParagraph 20: The land that is now Oberhausen's municipal area was settled very early on. A few archaeological finds at barrows of the so-called \"Old Hunsr\u00fcck-Eifel Culture\", for instance a bronze torc and bronze armrings, are traces of human habitation from the time between 600 and 400\u00a0BC. Leading across what is now the municipal area were two important prehistoric roads, of which the so-called Salzstra\u00dfe (\"Salt Road\") linked the upper Nahe region with the Rhine and the other, a road from Kirchberg to Meisenheim, served as a north\u2013south link between the Moselle region and the North Palatine Uplands. Oberhausen's first documentary mentions are found in documents from 1342 (Obernhusen) and 1346. The latter is a Weistum (cognate with English wisdom, this was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times) in which the court Sch\u00f6ffe (roughly \"lay jurist\") \"Hermann von Obirnhusen\" is named as a member of the Hennweiler court's council of Sch\u00f6ffen. Oberhausen then belonged to the Vogtei of Heinzenberg, a mediaeval jurisdictional and administrative region formed of the villages of Hennweiler, Oberhausen, Guntzelnberg, Rode and Heinzenberg and the Eigener Hof (an estate). Here, the Lords of Heinzenberg, who lived at a castle in the Kellenbach valley, were responsible as V\u00f6gte for giving the law and for raising tax revenue. Hennweiler was the \"mother village\" in this greater municipal area, whereas Oberhausen was, like all the other outlying villages, a \"daughter village\" or an \"expansion settlement\". The Vogtei region was also a parochial region whose mother church was Saint Stephen's (Stephanuskirche) in Hennweiler. In the Late Middle Ages, Oberhausen became part of the Lordship of Wartenstein and belonged to the Unteramt of Hennweiler. It was then that power passed from the Lords of Heinzenberg, first to Tilmann vom Stein (or Wartenstein), but he died without having fathered any male offspring, and his power eventually passed over time, by marriage into other families of the lower nobility, to other lines. These families who had acquired Tilmann's holdings and rights in the Lordship of Wartenstein, formed a kind of Ganerbengemeinschaft, a form of condominium, whereby they ruled jointly. In the course of the earlier half of the 16th century, the Lords of Schwarzenberg eventually managed to secure their place as the sole lordship in the Unteramt of Hennweiler, although they had to be mindful that their overlords were still the Counts Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken (later Dukes of Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken), who were rightful successors to the Counts of Veldenz. As the village lord, Johann III of Schwarzenberg introduced the Reformation into the parish of Hennweiler/Oberhausen sometime about 1550. Oberhausen formed together with Hennweiler a greater municipal area in the Late Middle Ages that was run as a Markgenossenschaft\u00a0\u2013 a combined municipality with one administration and a single body of law. It was only later that the municipal area was split between the two villages. The villages' common woodlands were shared out as late as 1769. Beginning in 1798, Oberhausen lay under French rule, as did all the German lands on the Rhine's left bank. This lasted until the Napoleonic French were driven out in 1814. During this time, Oberhausen belonged to the Mairie (\"Mayoralty\") of Kirn in the Arrondissement of Simmern. After the Congress of Vienna had grouped the village into the Kingdom of Prussia, Oberhausen remained with the same mayoralty, although the German word B\u00fcrgermeisterei was now used for it. After Kirn was granted town rights in 1857, though, it together with the outlying villages formed a municipal body known as the Landb\u00fcrgermeisterei Kirn, which was headed by the mayor of Kirn. This \"personal union\" was dissolved in 1896, whereupon representatives of the rural villages chose their own B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor). Ever since, Oberhausen has remained in this municipal league of \"Kirn-Land\" without interruption, although in the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, it ceased to be an Amt in 1969 and became instead the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land. Over the last few decades, Oberhausen has grown from a mainly agriculturally orientated village into a modern residential community. Since 1953/1954, water has been supplied to the village by the Gruppenwasserwerk Krebsweiler (\"Krebsweiler Group Waterworks\"). Sewerage was laid between 1956 and 1963, and carries sewage to the treatment plant at Kirn.\n\nParagraph 21:  Jerry Church, Esper 2 (the \"2\" is struck through with a \"/\" in the original text) is an ostracized Esper who once helped Reich profit by reading the minds of business rivals.  He runs a pawn shop, from which Reich obtains the gun he uses to kill D'Courtney. Reich made millions from Church, but Church lost everything.  No Esper will even talk to him, let alone communicate with him telepathically.  At one point in the book, he stands outside Powell's house, eavesdropping on the Esper party inside, so great is his need for that kind of contact.  Powell detects him and offers him a drink, but Jerry resents his pity, throws it back at him and runs off.  After the murder, Jerry passes on information about Barbara D'Courtney's whereabouts to Keno Quizzard, leading Reich to find her at Chooka Frood's just as Powell, alerted by his own investigation, arrives.  Later, Keno's men attack his shop with him, Powell, and Tate inside.  Tate, foreseeing that his criminal involvement will be his undoing, commits suicide by allowing himself to be destroyed by the effects of the harmonic gun.  Powell persuades Jerry to turn against Reich, blaming him for the attack.  Jerry's testimony about the gun purchase is a vital piece of evidence.\n\nParagraph 22: The film begins with 40 thieves making huge robberies at various places of Baghdad and hiding their stolen treasure at a secret cave called Sesame. Once their Sardar  sends his acolyte Choto  with his daughter Marjiana to find out the wealthy people in the city. Alibaba is a young & energetic guy, sees the dance performance of Marjiana, develops an acquaintance with her and both of them fall in love. Alibaba & his mother Chandbibi  lives along with his elder brother Kasim Khan  a rich person but a huge miser and similarly, his wife Sultana is a shrew. They separate Alibaba and gives two donkeys for his livelihood, so, he decides to bring wood from the forest. Once Alibaba is cutting wood he observes the head of the thieves chanting some words of a cave door opens and when they come out and he chants some other words. Alibaba secretly enters into the cave, notices a lot of treasure, collects it and comes back. Now Alibaba becomes one of the richest person of Baghdad. Kasim Khan feels jealous about his brother's wealth, he silently knows regarding the secret treasure, reaches the cave and becomes flabbergasted. By the time, thieves arrive and catch him and learn his brother also knows this place. So, they take him to their fort and starts torturing him. Understanding the situation, Alibaba immediately rushes to the cave and finds out the route to the fort. But he also caught when Marjiana helps them to escape. Knowing it, Angered, Chotu tries to kill Marjiana but Sardar obstructs his way and dies. Alibaba brings his brother back, due to fear of the thieves he secretly brings the village doctor by blindfolding and keeping his brother in a dark room. After the treatment, while leaving, the clever doctor keeps a mark on the door. After that, Alibaba again goes to the thieves fort saves Marjiana and brings her home. Meanwhile, Kasim recovers, realize his mistake and says sorry to Alibaba. Parallelly, Chotu secretly meets the doctor and asks him to reveal whom he recently cured of deadly wounds. So, he shows the house which he has marked, but Marjiana observes it and cleverly makes the same mark on every house. Now Chotu decides to burn the entire village when Alibaba motivates the villagers to safeguard the village from 4 sides. So, Chotu makes a ploy, enters the village as an oil merchant along with 39 oil barrels in which the remaining thieves are hidden. Alibaba gives him a warm welcome when, fortunately, the oil is nill in their kitchen. So, Marjiana goes to collect some oil from the barrels where she finds out that the thieves are hidden in it. Now Alibaba makes a plan, secretly burns all the barrels. Angered Chotu captures Marjiana and runs away to the cave, Alibaba follows him and stamps out Chotu. At last, Alibaba distributes the entire treasure in the cave to the villagers. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Alibaba & Marjiana.\n\nParagraph 23: In the U.S., the community college training model remains the most common, although some university-based paramedic education models exist. These variations in both educational approaches and standards has led to tremendous differences from one location to another. There may be situations in which a group of people with 120 hours of training, and another group (in another jurisdiction) with university degrees, were both calling themselves 'paramedics'. There were some efforts made to resolve these discrepancies. The National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT) along with National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) attempted to create a national standard by means of a common licensing examination, but to this day, this has never been universally accepted by U.S. States, and issues of licensing reciprocity for paramedics continue, although if an EMT obtains certification through NREMT (NREMT-P, NREMT-I, NREMT-B), this is accepted by 40 of the 50 states in the United States. This confusion was further complicated by the introduction of complex systems of gradation of certification, reflecting levels of training and skill, but these too were, for the most part, purely local. To clarify, at least at a national level, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is the federal organization with authority to administer the EMS system, defines the various titles given to prehospital medical workers based on the level of care they provide. They are EMT-P (Paramedic), EMT-I (Intermediate), EMT-B (Basic), and First Responders. While providers at all levels are considered emergency medical technicians, the term \"paramedic\" is most properly used in the United States to refer only to those providers who are EMT-P's. Apart from this distinction, the only truly common trend that would evolve was the relatively universal acceptance of the term 'emergency medical technician' being used to denote a lower level of training and skill than a 'paramedic'.\n\nParagraph 24: Winrod wrote in his book The Jewish Assault on Christianity, published in 1935 by a publishing company in Topeka, Kansas: \"The same forces which crucified Christ nineteen hundred years ago are today trying to crucify His Church. Many Christian leaders have not yet realized it, but Christianity is in the grip of a life and death struggle at the present time. International Jewish Communism, which has already undermined all nations, firmly expects to exterminate all Christians. What the Cause of Christ has endured in Russia the past eighteen years, surpasses its suffering at the hands of bloody Nero. One of the purposes of the present treatise is to show that this conspiracy is not of recent origin.\" The book was met with positive reception by many Christians at the time. Winrod would go on to say that he believed Jews were damned to hell, and that Jesus Christ condemned them in the Bible. He expanded upon these views, being quoted, \"Will the Church be able to demonstrate sufficient power to triumph over its foes in the present crisis, or has it become so weakened by apostasy and pernicious teachings that it will have to be drenched in its own blood before it can be brought to its senses? Jesus knew better than anyone else the unspeakable crimes of which [the Jews] are capable. The Jesus of the twenty-third chapter of Matthew, is not the quiet, reticent Jesus of modern literature and the fashionable pulpit. The Jesus, whose righteous indignation is here asserted, is a man of words and action, a man in the act of pronouncing eight woes upon the Jewish leaders and finally condemning them to the damnation of hell.\" Winrod spread these views through his newspaper, The Defender, which by 1937 achieved a 100,000 monthly circulation. Some of the articles reproduced materials from the pro-Nazi and virulently antisemitic international Welt-Dienst/World-Service/Service Mondial news agency founded in 1933 by Ulrich Fleischhauer.\n\nParagraph 25: Eternal Masters is a Magic compilation set released in June 2016.  Similar to the Modern Masters sets, it reprints cards, but from all of Magics history rather than restricting itself to the Modern format, thus aiming itself at casual formats such as Cube as well as the Vintage and Legacy formats.Modern Masters 2017 Edition (\"MM3\") was released on March 17, 2017.  It was also released in English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese.  The 2017 edition added Innistrad block, Return to Ravnica block, Magic 2013, and Magic 2014 to the sets eligible for a Modern Masters reprint.  Notable reprints in Modern Masters 2017 Edition included Tarmogoyf, Damnation, Liliana of the Veil, Snapcaster Mage, Voice of Resurgence, and the enemy color \"fetchlands\" such as Scalding Tarn.Iconic Masters is a Magic compilation set; it was released at Hasbro's HasCon's 25th anniversary celebration of Magic in September 2017, and released to the wider public in November 2017.  It is a compilation set with reprinted cards originating throughout the history of Magic, similar to Eternal Masters.  The set is generally perceived to have had poor sales due to the two month delayed nature of its wide release, which happened only a few weeks before the release of Unstable.  Wizards of the Coast would later apologize for setting wrong expectations for the set as well as the strange scheduling after receiving negative feedback about the set.Masters 25 (A25) was released on March 16, 2018.  It was themed as a celebration of 25 years of the history of Magic, with cards from every printed set.Ultimate Masters (UMA) was released on December 7, 2018.  In the set's official announcement, it was noted that it would have an unusually high price point, but would contain unusually high-value reprints.  It is the first Magic set to include a regular-sized \"box topper\" promotional card with each booster box.  Wizards of the Coast announced that it would be the last Masters set for some time; however, Double Masters would be released less than two years later. Double Masters (2XM) was released on August 7, 2020.  Due to the \"double\" theme of the set, each draft booster contains two rare or mythic cards and two foil cards of any rarity, and each booster box contains two \"box topper\" promotional cards.  It is the first Masters set to be released without an official list price. \n\nParagraph 26: Electrification of the Southport route was begun in 1902. It was increasingly popular for commuting and pleasure trips, but suffered from competition from the Cheshire Lines Railway. Electric traction was seen as cleaner than steam locomotives, and with coal prices rising, potentially cheaper. At the time, concerns were being expressed, especially in the railway press, that engineering developments in Britain was being overtaken by electrification projects in America and Switzerland. Preston-based Dick, Kerr and Company was responsible for the traction systems and the L&YR built the rolling stock. A 625 V DC four-rail system was adopted. A live rail was outside the running rails  from the centre of the track and  above the top of the running rails. A return rail, cross-bonded to the running rails, was positioned centrally between the tracks. The route was  long and gaps were left at 46 level crossings. The L&YR built a power station at Formby, generating 7.5 kV AC, conveyed to four sub-stations by underground cables.\n\nParagraph 27: In the 2,398th match played at the ground, with both sides looking to qualify for European football in the 2016\u201317 season, in front of a crowd of 34,907, West Ham took the lead in the tenth minute through Diafra Sakho, only for Manchester United to make the score 1\u20132 with two goals from Anthony Martial. However, Michail Antonio equalized for West Ham and Winston Reid scored a third in the 80th minute to make it 3\u20132, the final score. It was West Ham's 384th Premier League match, their 990th in the top division, and their 1,662nd ever league match at the ground, the win signifying 601 home Premier League points won there. Mark Noble was named Man of the Match. The match was followed by a 45-minute display on the pitch in celebration of the history of the ground. The following day, the club condemned the violence aimed at the Manchester United coach, vowing to ban for life any person convicted. Three people were arrested on the night of the game, two for pitch incursion and one for throwing a bottle at the police. The following day, the Metropolitan Police issued pictures of four men they hoped to identify in connection with the coach attack.\n\nParagraph 28: The CPU die contains the majority of logic, all of the execution units and a level 0 (L0) instruction cache. The execution units consist of two integer units, address units, floating-point units (FPUs), memory units. The FPU hardware consists of a fused multiply add (FMA) unit and a divide unit. But the FMA instructions are really fused (that is, with a single rounding) only as of SPARC64 VI. The FMA unit is pipelined and has a four-cycle latency and a one-cycle-throughput. The divide unit is not pipelined and has significantly longer latencies. The L0 instruction cache has a capacity of 4\u00a0KB, is direct-mapped and has a one-cycle latency.\n\nParagraph 29: Peel began playing for Yorkshire in 1883 but, after a successful debut, was overshadowed in the team by Edmund Peate and often played only a minor role with the ball. Improvements in his batting and his excellence as a fielder kept him in the team, and when Peate was sacked for drunkenness in 1887, Peel became Yorkshire's main spinner. He had already played for England, touring Australia with two professional teams, although he did not play a Test in England until 1888. Over the following years he regularly took over 100 wickets in each season and often played in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players matches. He was generally Yorkshire's leading bowler\u2014until the emergence of George Hirst, he generally received little support from other members of the attack\u2014and often among their leading batsmen. His best season in county cricket came in 1896, when he recorded the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets, and made his highest first-class score of 210. Among his notable feats in Tests, he bowled England to victory after they had followed on in Australia in 1894\u201395 and took six for 23 in his final Test. The first English cricketer to reach 100 wickets against Australia, in 1894\u201395 he also became the first player to fail to score in four successive Test innings.\n\nParagraph 30: Chemical industries such as Aarti, Supreet Chemicals, and textile giants such as Alok industries, Welspun Terry Towels, Century Textiles, GHCL and Raymonds Limited have strong presences in Vapi and nearby areas. Bayer Vapi Pvt Ltd, United Phosphorus Ltd., Supreet Chemicals Pvt Ltd., Sarna Chemicals, Sangir Plastics, Kampun Polymers, Lathia Rubbers, Arti Industries Ltd., Themis Industries and Hubergroup India Pvt Ltd (formerly Micro Inks Limited), operate manufacturing plants in Vapi. Today, about 70% of the total industries in the township are chemical plants, mainly for chemical distillation and the production of pesticides, dyes, dye intermediaries and paints. Other major industries include paper, packaging, pharmaceuticals, plastics, rubber, textiles, wood, computer hardware and software, engineering workshops, glass, and food products. Another striking feature of Vapi is the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (or CETP). This is the largest of its kind in Asia and one of India's biggest effluent treatment plants in terms of capacity, treating the pollutants from these industries before the effluent is released into the river. The CETP is run by Vapi Waste and Effluent Management Company, promoted by the Vapi Industries Association. Vapi has the maximum number of Kraft paper & duplex board paper mills in India. The best quality paper producers are located in Vapi and to have more than 20 kraft paper mills within a distance of 20 km. Therefore, Vapi is also known as \"paper hub\".", "answers": ["Paragraph 24"], "pred": "1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,", "length": 8832, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "803a8ee56e14440e185aaf0eb0f82b9f060cb70b4b074311"}

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: In 2008 Ohio experienced an unintended consequence of a new statute that resulted in a brief period of overlap voting, when absentee voting has started and before the close of voter registration.  This period ran from September 30 until October 6, due to the newly instituted early voting policy. On August 13, 2008, Brunner ordered county election board officials to establish procedures to enable voters who register to be immediately issued an absentee ballot.  Because a voter could show up with only a cell phone bill, give any four digits and claim they were the last four digits of his or her Social Security Number, and then immediately vote and have such ballots put into the same pool as other votes with no procedure for more rigorous scrutiny of their validity, the Republican Party opposed the same day voting plan and fought it in several Ohio Courts. Ohio Republican Party officials and Republican voters argued in separate lawsuits that Ohio law requires voters to be registered for 30 days before they cast an absentee ballot. On September 29, 2008 (a day after lower state and federal courts overruled GOP objections to same-day registration and voting or GOP requests for mandated ballot segregation and verification) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, Ohio rejected Republican efforts to stop the plan. United States district court judge James Gwin in Cleveland, Ohio also ruled against the Republicans and issued a restraining order to enforce Brunner's plan. In Columbus, Ohio, U.S. District Judge George Smith declined to rule on another statewide challenge, deferring to the state Supreme Court's decision. The rulings, which opened a window to register and vote on the same day until the absentee ballot deadline on October 6, 2008, was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision in which two Republican jurists who were on the November 2008 ballot recused themselves and were replaced by one Republican and one Democrat by Chief Justice Thomas Moyer.  The normal roster of Ohio Supreme Court jurists is all Republican and the lone Democrat replacement, William H. Wolff Jr., cast the tie-breaking vote.  The dissenters noted that Ohio's Constitution requires that a person register to vote 30 days in before voting. Brunner ordered segregation of same-day-registration ballots and verification of them before counting them on Election Day, November 4, 2008.  In related proceedings on September 30, 2008, Judge Smith of The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in Columbus had granted an Ohio Republican Party request for a restraining order that would mandate election observers during early voting.  Brunner prevailed in the appellate court which ruled that the district court \"abused its discretion\" in granting the restraining order.\n\nParagraph 2: Throughout 1990, the KLF launched a series of singles with an upbeat pop-house sound which they dubbed \"stadium house\". Songs from The White Room soundtrack were re-recorded with rap and more vocals (by guests labelled \"Additional Communicators\"), a sample-heavy pop-rock production and crowd noise samples. The first \"stadium house\" single, \"What Time Is Love? (Live from Trancentral)\", released in October 1990, reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart and hit the top-ten internationally. The follow-up, \"3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)\", was an international top-five hit in January 1991, reaching #1 in the UK and #5 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The album The White Room followed in March 1991, reaching #3 in the UK. A substantial reworking of the aborted soundtrack, the album featured a segued series of \"stadium house\" songs followed by downtempo tracks.The KLF's chart success continued with the single \"Last Train to Trancentral\" hitting number two in the UK, and number three on the Eurochart Hot 100. In December 1991, a re-working of a song from 1987, \"Justified & Ancient\" was released, featuring Tammy Wynette. It was another international hit \u2013 peaking at number two in the UK, and number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2013 as was \"America: What Time Is Love?\", a hard, guitar-laden reworking of \"What Time Is Love?\". In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by Depeche Mode (\"Policy of Truth\"), the Moody Boys (\"What Is Dub?\"), and Pet Shop Boys (\"So Hard\" from the Behaviour album, and \"It Must Be Obvious\"). Neil Tennant described the process: \"When they did the remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ... I had to go and sing the vocals again, they did it in a different way. I was impressed that Bill Drummond had written all the chords out and played it on an acoustic guitar, very thorough.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Wizard, at different points, incorporates prog, psychedelic rock, Broadway show tunes, bubblegum pop, and Philadelphia soul. Other influences were drawn from jazz and funk. Schuckett said that Rundgren often spoke of Ravel as his favorite classical composer at the time, although \"I don't think Todd really listened to much funk, so [me and Moogy] were kind of showing him that stuff.\" Musicologist Daniel Harrison likened  Wizard to late 1960s Beach Boys work such as Smiley Smile, specifically in that the albums shared musical aspects such as \"abrupt transitions, mixture of various pop styles, and unusual production effects.\" Harrison added that few artists in this period chose to emulate the Beach Boys' experiments due to the band's poor commercial standing. Overall, music writers have described Wizard as a work of progressive pop, psychedelia and avant-pop. Rundgren said that adapting his sound to meet commercial expectations was never an issue for him since he already made \"so much money from production\", a rare luxury for an artist. He recalled that Bearsville owner Albert Grossman, however, was \"surprisingly\" encouraging of Wizard. Klingman remembered Grossman walking in on a session of \"Da Da Dali\" and found Rundgren singing in an exaggerated Al Jolson voice while the band were purposely playing \"all wrong notes\", and yet \"Albert didn't miss a beat. ... He just kept silent and nodded like everything was fine.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Pratt was appointed a chaplain of the East India Company through his father's influence on Bishop Daniel Wilson in 1838. He became Wilson's domestic chaplain, and in 1850 was appointed Archdeacon of Calcutta. The leisure allowed during his position in India allowed him to pursue mathematics although he noted that it was difficult to work alone and led to long exchanges in the journals of learned societies in Britain. When Bishop Wilson died in 1858, he was nominated for the position of Bishop. He was approved with the influence of Lord Shaftesbury on Lord Palmerston but it was shortly after decided in the wake of the 1857 uprising that no appointee known for missionary work should be appointed. The chosen appointee was instead Bishop Cotton. They held each other in high esteem. In 1864 an order was passed by the Secretary of State in India to retire chaplains after twenty-five years (earlier unlimited). An exception was made for Pratt and he was extended from October 1867 to March 1869 based on pleas from Bishop Cotton. When Pratt wished to resign in 1869, the Secretary of State extended his service to October 1872. After the death of Bishop Cotton in 1866, Pratt started a Hill Schools' Nomination Endowment Fund to help support Bishop Cotton's scheme of starting schools in the pleasant climate of the hills for the benefit of the children of poorer English residents in India who could not afford an education in England. Pratt married Hannah Maria Brown, daughter of George Francis Brown, a Bengal Civil Servant, at Bhagalpur on 6 March 1854. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1866. Pratt served as president of the Calcutta Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals founded by Colesworthey Grant in 1861. He died from cholera when he was on a visit to Ghazipur, India, on 28 December 1871. At the instigation of Bishop Robert Milman, a memorial to Pratt was erected in St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1932 he managed to take over the publication of the Kyipwayay (Progress/Growth) magazine after a false start by the chairman U Thein. He had wanted to be a writer and publisher and grabbed the opportunity. The magazine was a success with most of the day's famous writers on board and with an editorial remit of educating young people in self-improvement, health and moral discipline in the struggle for independence and for building a new united Burma. Regular columns such as Maha Swe's Nei Thu Yein's Fearless Doctrine and Theippan Maung Wa's Letter from Maung Than Gyaung attracted a large readership. The Kyipwayay became the vehicle for a new style and content in Burmese literature known as Hkit san (Testing the Age), a movement started most notably by Theippan Maung Wa, Nwe Soe, Zawgyi, Min Thu Wun, Maung Thuta, Maung Htin and Mya Kaytu. He also wrote articles assuming the pen names Kyipwayay Maung Hla and Maung Kan Kaung. A devout Buddhist and non-violent reformist at heart, he made friends with and his home became a favourite haunt of many politicians such as Aung San, Thakin Than Tun, Thakin Zin and Thakin Ba Koe as well as writers such as Maha Swe, Dagon Taya, Zawana, P Moe Nin, Thukha, Maung Htin and Dr Maung Hpyuu, journalists such as Thuriya U Thein Maung, cartoonists U Ba Galay, U Hein Soon and U Ba Gyan, artist U Ohn Lwin and weightlifters Ka-ya bala U Shein, U Zaw Weik and U Ne Win. The Thuriya (Sun) newspaper was where he had started as a budding writer and where he appeared to have learnt the rudiments of journalism and publishing. U Hla was tall, fair and handsome (Hla incidentally means handsome), and known for his friendly smile, gentle soft-spoken manner, even temper, clean living and generosity.\n\nParagraph 6: The railroad charter was issued in the wake of a controversy over the nature of state-issued corporate charters that led to the first-ever veto by a Massachusetts governor.  In 1826, after several years of lobbying by its proponents, the legislature granted a charter to the Warren Bridge Company for a second bridge connecting Boston to Charlestown.  The proprietors proposed that the bridge would charge tolls for only six years and then become free.  The proprietors of the competing Charles River Bridge, which also charged tolls, objected, claiming that the state had granted it an exclusive charter for that crossing, and prevailed on Lincoln to veto the new charter.  This he did; the veto was overridden in the House but not the Senate.  The veto brought in a storm of criticism from populist supporters of the new bridge, who established the Free Bridge Party and ran William C. Jarvis against Lincoln in the 1827 election.  Lincoln approved the charter when it was resubmitted in 1828, after which the Charles River Bridge proprietors initiated a lawsuit.  With Daniel Webster as their attorney, the case Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge made its way to the United States Supreme Court, which in 1837 ruled that the state had not granted exclusive privileges to the Charles River Bridge proprietors.\n\nParagraph 7: One example is the \u201c Telegrafo Mercantil\u201d\u00a0 where\u00a0 contains a poem in honor of the recently appointed viceroy Joaqu\u00edn del Pino. The ideas of the enlightenment, especially practical and utilitarian knowledge to improve the quality of life, penetrated late in Spain due to isolation, traditionalist ideas and the peninsular Inquisition. It was this need to get Spain out of its growing backwardness, in the face of the development of the other European powers, that made the ministers and royal advisers transform these ideas into \"state policy\" .  The \"enlightened\" economic, social, administrative and political changes had to come from the top down: \"All for the people but without the people.\" In this context, the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata was created in 1776; as well as the Hearing in 1785 and the Consulate of Buenos Aires in 1794. The demographic, economic and bureaucratic growth of Buenos Aires gave rise to the birth of a heterodox elite both within the Church and in the secular sectors abandoning many lawyers and other counsels. Several Spanish Americans traveled to Spain to study, such as Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n (1770-1778), Dean Gregorio Funes (1775-1779) and Manuel Belgrano (1786-1793).  In 1783 the Royal College of San Carlos was inaugurated at the initiative of Viceroy V\u00e9rtiz and the leadership of the reformist canon Juan Baltazar Maciel, possessor of a wide and eclectic library that members of the elite could consult. All these changes not only aimed to increase the fiscal resources of the Crown, they also improved the living conditions of the inhabitants: health through the institution of the Protomedicato in 1780, the lighting of the streets and the reuse of the printing press of the Jesuits abandoned in C\u00f3rdoba which, at the beginning of 1780, was transferred by the order of Viceroy V\u00e9rtiz to Buenos Aires and given property to the Casa de los Ni\u00f1os Foundling for the printing of government documents or cathons and primers used by the Catholic Enlightenment.\n\nParagraph 8: He graduated from the University of Damascus in 1923 with a degree in law, and joined the city government in 1925. At this time he also actively ran his family's estates throughout the country. In the 1930s, he became close associates with leading members of the anti-French National Bloc coalition such as future presidents Hashim al-Atassi and Shukri al-Kuwatli. He remained a longtime supporter of the former, but often quarreled with the latter, whom he accused of being too authoritarian. In 1941 the French appointed him Prime Minister and Acting President, having had no success in finding a viable candidate since the resignation of the nationalist Atassi in 1939. However he was replaced 5 months later with a French loyalist, Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Azm served repeatedly in parliament and in the cabinet from 1943 to 1947. He became a focus of opposition when he resigned from the cabinet in 1945 and lead the forces opposed to Kuwatli's drive to amend the constitution to allow himself a second term in office. Kuwatli prevailed, and Azm ran against him in 1947 and lost. However he accepted the position of envoy to France and served in that capacity for a year. He concluded successful arms purchases from France and later from the Soviet Union. In May 1948, Azm agreed to form a multi-party cabinet under Kuwatli which served until March 1949. He allied himself with France and the United States and attempted to obtain loans from them for domestic development. He traveled frequently to attend United Nations assemblies on the Palestinian problem. Azm clashed with members of the military, especially Chief of Staff Husni al-Za'im. The latter launched a coup d'\u00e9tat on 29 March 1949 and imprisoned both Azm and president Kuwatli. When Za'im was overthrown five months later, Azm returned to parliament as deputy for Damascus and became Minister of Finance. He was also elected into the Constituent Assembly that drafted a new constitution for Syria. He became Prime Minister again under Hashim al-Atassi's second administration, in June 1950, heading three cabinets between then and 1951. Azm closed the border to Lebanese goods in an attempt to prevent the crash of domestic Syrian industry due to rampant Lebanese imports. He also clashed repeatedly with the military because he refused to appoint officers in any of his cabinets, and always reserved the defense portfolio for himself. He also clashed with pro-Hashemite elements in Syrian politics that advocated union with Iraq. Socialists distrusted him because of his aristocratic and wealthy Ottoman background. Azm left the public arena from 1951 to 1954 in protest over the coup of Adib al-Shishakli which toppled Atassi's democratic administration.\n\nParagraph 9: Omnibus In CollaborationA Taste of Heaven / Moonlight Lover / Gypsy Jewel / Sea Mistress (1993) (with Barbara Benedict, Patricia McAllister and Candace McCarthy)A Baby?

That same year, at the age of 16, she recorded the first version of Ed Cobb's ballad, \"Every Little Bit Hurts\", released as a single by Del-Fi Records.  She also recorded duets with Hal Davis for the Minasa and Snap labels, and worked with other local recording artists. After graduating from Jordan High School, she also studied music at Compton Community College. In late 1963, she was invited by Davis to a deejay's party which Motown CEO Berry Gordy Jr. was attending, and lip-synced to Mary Wells' hit \"You Beat Me to the Punch\".  Gordy was impressed by Holloway's looks, and subsequently by her vocal power, and opted to sign her to Motown. Holloway was 17 at the time, and was Motown's first West Coast signing.\n\nParagraph 11: The Binis, also called the Edo people, are people of the South South region of modern Nigeria; they are said to be around 3.8 million as of the 21st Century. They are ruled by monarchs, and are famous for their Benin Bronzes. In the pre-colonial period, they controlled a powerful empire. They are an ethnic group that is primarily found in Edo State, and spread across the Delta, Ondo, and Rivers states of Nigeria in smaller concentrations. The language they speak is called the Edo language. The Bini people are closely related to several other ethnic groups that usually speak Edoid languages, for example the Esan, however it is important to address the fact that the name \"Benin\" (and \"Bini\") is a Portuguese corruption, which came from the word \"Ubinu\", which came into use during the reign of Oba Ewuare the Great, c. 1440. The word \"Ubinu\" was used to depict and portray the royal administrative centre or capital proper of the kingdom, Edo. The word \"Ubinu\" was later corrupted to Bini by a number of mixed ethnicities staying together at the centre, and it was then further corrupted to Benin around the year 1485 at the time when the Portuguese people started making trade relations with Oba Ewuare.\n\nParagraph 12: Carissa is born with a face resembling a monkey. All her life, she and her disfigured family experienced persecution from all the people around her because she is branded as the town jinx. She and her family tried to run away but ended up as a sideshow in a carnival. She was mistreated by everyone and became an object of jokes as well as of disgust. But the happy-go-lucky guy, Mendez is different. Mendez befriended the disfigured Carissa and saw what others failed to see, her beautiful heart. There came a time that Mendez ultimately fell in love with \"the monkey-girl\". Meanwhile, Alicia has a bad feeling that there's something not right in her own house. The famous model has a feeling that her husband, the famous plastic surgeon, Hugo Roldan, is having an affair with her own best friend, Morita. She caught him red-handed and decided to go away. Hugo tried to beg for mercy so she would not go but she still left. Tragically, Alicia's flight crashed in the sea and she was one of the casualties. They never found her body and Hugo is left with nothing but remorse and guilt. If only he could bring back the wife he failed to love with all his heart. That is when he found the half-dead Carissa lying in the streets. Mendez left for work in an island resort to earn money for him and Carissa. While he is away, Shirley, the girl who also likes Mendez, forged his hand writing making Carissa believe that he left her for good. Then an epidemic spread across town and the poor Carissa was stoned by a mob thinking she is the jinx that brought the epidemic. Mendez came back for Carissa but they told him that Carissa died in an accident, then showed to him a fake grave. Now with nothing left in her heart but vengeance, Carissa agrees to be Hugo's test patient for a new revolutionary surgical procedure that could copy another person's face. Carissa studied manners, etiquette, fashion and everything about the high society. Carissa took the identity of Alicia. She is now what Alicia was, Hugo's \"wife\" and a goddess in the fashion industry. She agreed to this arrangement because of 2 reasons; to show gratitude to Hugo and to exact revenge on everyone who made her suffer. She was surprised that Alicia owned a resort and her bodyguard is Mendez. She went to the people that caused her pain and showed Mendez how she made them suffer. With the change of her face, her heart also changed. But still, Mendez could not explain why he is falling for a \"horrible\" woman like \"Alicia\". She was supposed to punish him but ended up falling for him even more. She can't bear her feelings anymore now that she knows what Shirley actually did. She told everything to Mendez and the lovers picked up where they left off. They had an \"affair\" but she is afraid what would Hugo do now that she saw Hugo's evil side. She then learns about the dark secrets of the face she now possess. Secrets that could ruin Hugo and bring back to Mendez what was stolen from him. Mendez's father, Dr. Pedroza was a famous plastic surgeon who created the procedure. But young, ambitious doctor Hugo stole the plan then made it as his own, destroying Dr. Pedroza's reputation. He then seduced Mrs. Pedroza which led to the heart attack and death of Dr. Pedroza, leaving the poor kid, Mendez with nothing that's why he grew up in the streets. Hugo then experimented on countless women like Carissa but ended up with dead patients including Carissa's sister. Now, Carissa just wants to leave with Mendez and hatched a plan to take Hugo's wealth that is really for Mendez. But will their plan prevail? Now that Hugo has also a plan as diabolical as their own.\n\nParagraph 13: On the October 18 episode of Raw is War, Big Boss Man challenged Big Show to a match and agreed to defend the WWF Hardcore Championship. Big Show accepted the challenge. However, before the match Big Show left the arena to check on his father, who had reportedly died (in storyline). The report was later revealed as a plan of Boss Man. On the October 21 episode of SmackDown, an enraged Big Show attempted to attack Boss Man but Boss Man escaped. Big Show then assaulted the police officer. On the October 25 episode of Raw is War, Boss Man distracted Big Show during his match with Prince Albert. Albert attacked Big Show from behind and Boss Man broke Big Show's father's watch with a hammer. As a result, Boss Man and Albert formed a new alliance. On the October 28 episode of SmackDown, Al Snow had a match with Boss Man. However, Boss Man's ally, Albert continuously interfered in the match and the two attacked Snow, leading him to challenge both men to a Hardcore match in the parking lot. Later that night, Boss Man and Albert went to the parking lot to wrestle Snow but instead of Snow, Big Show appeared. He trapped Boss Man and Albert in a car, smashed it into pieces and pushed a dumpster on the top of the car. On the November 1 episode of Raw is War, Boss Man and Albert attacked Big Show during an interview. On the November 8 episode of Raw is War, a tribute was paid to Big Show's father on his death. Boss Man came out and insulted Big Show and his father. On the November 11 episode of SmackDown, footage was shown of Boss Man interrupting the funeral, attacking Big Show and ruining the grave. This led to a Survivor Series match between Big Show's team (consisting of Kai En Tai (Funaki and Taka Michinoku) and The Blue Meanie) and Boss Man's team (consisting of Prince Albert, Viscera and Mideon). On the November 14 episode of Sunday Night Heat, Big Show attacked all of his team members, who withdrew from the team, making the match a 4-on-1 Survivor Series match.\n\nParagraph 14: WritingThe Incredible Melting Man was written and directed by filmmaker William Sachs. The idea for the film came to him when his mother, working in the office of a spray paint company, showed him \"gooey stuff\" which was used as a basis for spray paint and jokingly suggested that he should do a film featuring that material. During writing, Sachs was influenced by The Night of the Living Dead and wanted to give the film a 1950s horror film feeling. But the final film, with its structure changed by the producers in post-production, has been described by some sources \u2013 including the film magazine Cinefantastique and the 1995 book Cult Science Fiction Films \u2013 as a remake of First Man into Space (1959), another film about an astronaut who becomes a monster after an accident in space. Science fiction film historian Gene Wright suggested that the final film was heavily influenced by The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), a British horror film about an astronaut who begins mutating into an alien organism after a spaceflight. Sachs, however, had never seen either of those films, and his original screenplay had a very different structure. He had originally written the script for The Incredible Melting Man as a parody of horror films. According to Michael Adams, a film reviewer who interviewed Sachs, this was the reason that the film mixed horror with comedic moments, such as when Steve West's detached ear gets stuck on a tree, and when a janitor sweeps West's melted body into a garbage can at the end of the film. Adams claims that this explains several comedic lines of dialogue otherwise inconsistent with the rest of the film, including one moment when homeless men notice the melting West and say to each other, \"You think we've got trouble, look at that dude\". In Sachs' original version, the film opened with the wide-angle shot of the nurse running through the hallway; this would not have been in slow motion, unlike the final film, where the producers played it back slowed down. Only later would viewers have gradually learned the background of the melting man. All the scenes showing the astronauts in space and the lead character in the hospital were re-shot during post-production without influence by the director, and Sachs criticized both the acting in those scenes and how they restructure the film. There are logical problems in the final film due to the re-shot scenes; it is never fully explained how West's spacecraft returned to Earth from Saturn when West himself was so seriously injured and the other two members of his crew were both killed.\n\nParagraph 15: George Harrison guest stars in the episode as himself. He was the second Beatles member after Ringo Starr (in \"Brush with Greatness\") to appear on The Simpsons. When Harrison arrived at the recording studio in West Los Angeles to record his lines, the casting director told the episode's show runners, Al Jean and Mike Reiss, that Harrison was coming and that they were not allowed to tell anybody about it because it was intended to be a secret to the staff. Jean, Reiss, and the show's creator Matt Groening went to see Harrison in the studio, and when they returned to the writer's room, Groening, unaware that it was supposed to be a secret, said, \"Guess who I just met! George Harrison!\" Harrison arrived at the studio by himself, without any entourage or bodyguards. Groening recalls that Harrison was \"pretty glum,\" and he was unenthusiastic when the staff asked him questions about the Beatles. However, when Groening asked Harrison about the Wonderwall Music album, he suddenly \"perked up\" because it was one of his solo albums that he was rarely questioned on. Harrison's guest appearance was one of Groening's favorites because he was \"super nice\" and \"very sweet\" to the staff. Jean said it was a \"huge thrill\" to have him appear. David Crosby also makes a guest appearance in the episode as himself, and appears in the scene in which he presents a Grammy Award to the Be Sharps.\n\nParagraph 16: Less than a year later, the center of the project had shifted to the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Manley received a personal call from Leo Szilard to move from the Metallurgical Laboratory to Los Alamos and on April 4, 1943, Manley arrived at the laboratory. Manley spent his first days in Los Alamos working with other newcomers on the construction of laboratory buildings. He also installed a Cockcroft\u2013Walton generator, which he had brought with him from Urbana. Throughout the war Manley served as one of Oppenheimer's principal aides, with particular responsibility for laboratory management. His wife Kay moved to Los Alamos in June 1943, following the birth of their second daughter. She was hired as a human computer in the T (Theoretical) Division but then quit after six months to focus on raising their children.\n\nParagraph 17: There are two envelope glycoproteins. The G glycoprotein ectodomain assembles as a homotetramer to form the viral anti-receptor or attachment protein, which binds to the receptor on the host cell. Each strand in the ectodomain consists of four distinct regions: at the N-terminal and connecting to the viral surface is the helical stalk, followed by the beta-sandwich neck domain, the linker region and finally, at the C-terminal, four heads which contain host cell receptor binding domains.  Each head consists of a beta-propellor structure with six blades. There are three unique folding patterns of the heads, resulting in a 2-up/2-down configuration where two heads are positioned distal to the virus and two heads are proximal. Due to the folding patterns and subsequent arrangement of the heads, only one of the four heads is positioned with its binding site accessible to associate with the host B2/B3 receptor. The G protein head domain is also highly antigenic, inducing head-specific antibodies in primate models. As such, it is a prime target for vaccine development as well as antibody therapy. One head-specific antibody, m102.4, has been used in compassionate use cases and has completed Phase 1 clinical trials.  The F glycoprotein forms a trimer, which mediates membrane fusion.\n\nParagraph 18: The video of this song was directed by Jim Shea, and features footage of Paisley singing in a forest, as well as home movies of himself with his grandfather, Warren L. Jarvis. He also holds up photos of himself with Jarvis and his aunt Rita Takach. The video was filmed in Northern California. The extended version of the video ends with Jarvis in a home movie saying \"Come on in and rock a while!\" and Paisley smiling when he looks up from his guitar playing and sees this. It also features many different people holding photographs of loved ones who have presumably died. Two notable people featured in this video are Michael Reagan, who is shown holding a photograph of his father Ronald Reagan, and Teresa Earnhardt, who is shown sitting in front of a painted portrait of her husband, NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt. Although she does vocals on the song, Dolly Parton is off camera singing in the video. However, she is shown holding a picture of her grandfather, Rev. Jake Owens, who'd died a few years earlier. She kisses her hand then touches the photograph in this scene. Figure Skater Scott Hamilton is shown holding a picture of his mother. John Carter Cash is featured holding a photo of his parents, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Also in the video is Pixar director John Lasseter holding up a picture of co-director and fellow CalArts alumnus Joe Ranft who suddenly died in 2005 in a car accident.  Various unknown people hold up photos of relatives who have passed on throughout as well. In 2007, after the Virginia Tech massacre, the last slide was dedicated to those lost with the VT emblem shining brightly. On tour in 2008, Paisley also added a picture of late actor Heath Ledger.\n\nParagraph 19:  Mouse (voiced by Louise Vallance) knew Bob from back when he arrested her from trying to hack into the Super-Computer. A hacker extraordinaire with a sugary Southern accent, she is equipped with a katana to cut her enemies into small pieces, and a high-tech craft called Ship. Sometimes she is seen with another, smaller sword, but she rarely uses it. It is probably a wakizashi to complete a samurai's daisho, which consists of the two aforementioned swords.  She is first mentioned in the episode \"The Crimson Binome\", which hints at an untold encounter between Mouse and the pirate crew of the Saucy Mare; Bob, imprisoned in the ship's brig, finds Mouse's calling card (a stylized drawing of a mouse) on the wall, a clue to an avenue of escape.  She first appears on-screen in \"The Great Brain Robbery\", hired as a mercenary by Megabyte (during the episode, she calls him \"big guy\" and \"Megababe\"); she turned against him when it became obvious she had been double-crossed and was endangering a young child. She later returned in Season 2 to save Bob and Dot from Gigabyte and ended up as part of the main cast from then on. She had been hired by the Guardians to discover if there was a Web Creature in Mainframe; during the subsequent Web War and then the Viral Wars, Mouse's hacking skills became a major asset in thwarting Mainframe's enemies, including developing a Firewall so complex that Daemon could not get through it, and was blocked from multiple Systems.  Due to her invaluable assistance, Mouse is allowed to upgrade her icon (and AndrAIa's as well) to a full Mainframe icon which, among other things, created a backup of her that allowed her to be restored along with the native Mainframers after the system crashed (\"End Prog\").\n\nParagraph 20: Tikki Tikki Tembo is set in ancient China and invents an ancient Chinese custom whereby parents honor their first-born sons with long, elaborate names that everyone is obliged to say completelyno nicknames, no shortening of any kindwhile second-born sons are typically given short, unimportant names.  A boy named Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo (\"The Most Wonderful Thing in the Whole Wide World\") and his little brother Chang (\"Little or Nothing\") are playing very close to a well at their house that their mother has warned them to avoid. Chang falls in the well and his older brother runs to their mother and tells her Chang has fallen down the well. Their mother tells him to get the Old Man with the Ladder. He goes and tells the Old Man. Chang is rescued and then recovers quickly. Some time later, the boys are again playing near the well. This time, the older brother falls in. Chang runs to their mother and tries to tell her that \"Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo has fallen into the well.\" At first she cannot hear him so he says it again. However, because Chang is out of breath from running he sputters and then mispronounces the name. His mother insists that he repeat the namebut with respect. He tries repeatedly until finally his mother tells Chang to get the Old Man with the Ladder. Chang goes to the Old Man with the Ladder. Initially, the old man does not respond because he is asleep. Further, when Chang tries to wake him up, the Old Man with the Ladderannoyedtries to fall back asleep. After Chang breathlessly repeats his brother's predicament the Old Man goes with Chang to save his brother from the well. They get Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo from the well, but because of the long time he was in the well, it takes longer for him to recover. The end of the story says that this is why the Chinese have short names.\n\nParagraph 21: Music for Relief contributed $57,000 in 2011 for the planting of 57,000 trees with The Nature Conservancy in Brazil's Atlantic Forest for their Plant A Billion Trees campaign. Only 12% of the Atlantic Forest's original area remains and only 7% is well conserved. It is one of the world's most endangered tropical forests, threatened by coastal development, urban expansion, and illegal logging. The forest provides clean water and hydro energy for over 130 million Brazilians and is home to an extraordinary array of biodiversity found nowhere else on earth. Much of what remains of the forest is found in isolated fragments, which are often too small to support a full array of its extraordinary biodiversity.\n\nParagraph 22: Scribner's Magazine was the second periodical publication of the  Scribner's  firm, after Scribner's Monthly was published from 1870 to 1881. Scribner's Monthly was later moved to another publisher, and renamed The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Charles Scribner announced to a New York Times reporter that they would make a new monthly publication \"as soon as the necessary arrangements could be perfected\". It was also announced that the editor would be Edward Burlingame, the son of Anson Burlingame, who was already connected to the publishing house as literary adviser. Charles Scribner also noted that the magazine would not be a revival of the formerly published Scribner's Monthly. Charles Scribner's Sons spent over $500,000 in launching Scribner's Magazine   to compete with the already successful pictorials, The Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine. Burlingame hired the best artists in his country for the magazine; Howard Pyle, Howard Chandler Christy, Charles Marion Russell, Walter Everett, Maxfield Parrish and Frederic Remington. Before the first issue was released, Charles Scribner's Sons had their first annual \"Scribner's Magazine\" dinner at their main offices. Scribner's Magazine was launched in January 1887, the first issue of which was to be published from January to June of that year. The magazine was printed and bound by Trow's Printing and Bookbinding Company. Scribner's Magazine was also the first magazine to introduce color illustrations later on. The first issue opens with the literary article \"The Downfall to the Empire\". by E.B. Washburne, the former minister to France. An early morning fire in 1908 at the Charles Scribner's Sons offices heavily burned the third and fourth floors, where the  magazine was produced. In May 1914, the magazine's editor, Edward L. Burlingame, retired and Robert Bridges took over as editor. (Bridges was a lifelong close friend of President Woodrow Wilson ever since the two had met as students at Princeton University.)  During the First World War, the magazine employed authors, Richard Harding Davis, Edith Wharton and John Galsworthy, to write about the major conflict. During the time of 1917, when the United States joined the war, the magazine had four to six articles on the subject. On the date of November 19, 1922, the first editor of the magazine, Edward L. Burlingame, died. In January 1928 the magazine had a change in format, with the first of the newly formatted issue having a cover design by Rockwell Kent.\n\nParagraph 23: In the third approach, disk operations are virtualized and are actually translated into a network protocol. The data that is usually stored in a disk drive are then stored in virtual disks files homed on a server. The disk operations such as requests to read/write disk sectors are translated into corresponding network requests and processed by a service or daemon running on the server side. This is the implementation that is used by Neoware Image Manager, Ardence, VHD Central Management System and various \"boot over iSCSI\" products. This third approach differs from the first approach because what is remote is not a file system but actually a disk device (or raw device) and that the client OS is not aware that it is not running off a hard disk. This is why this approach is sometimes named \"Virtual Hard Disk\" or \"Network Virtual Disk\".\n\nParagraph 24: Hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Human immunodeficiency virus infection are classical examples of blood-borne diseases.  Unlike hepatitis A, which is spread by the fecal-oral route and is indicative of a breakdown in food safety or potable water protection, hepatitis B, C and HIV are spread by contact with bodily fluids, most frequently blood, although in the case of HIV, not exclusively so.  Also, unlike hepatitis A in which the sufferer almost always recovers completely, or rarely dies, both hepatitis B and C often give rise to chronic carrier states and indolent disease in many.  At present, Hepatitis C is the most common reason for liver transplantation in the US while HIV is currently incurable although its clinical course can be modified.  In any case, between them, they have changed awareness of infectious disease in sports, and certainly changed management on the playing surface.  Ironically, evidence for transmission of any of the three as a result of injury and/or contact on the playing surface is exceedingly limited and the greatest risk to the athlete surrounds behavior that may take place off court.  A case report in 1982 described 5 of 10 members of a Japanese high school sumo wrestling club who contracted hepatitis.  It was hypothesized that spread had occurred through skin cuts and abrasions. An outbreak of HBV in an American football team was reported in 2000.  Eleven of 65 athletes were found to be HBV positive in a 19-month surveillance period.  Contact with open wounds of an HBV carrier was again hypothesized. Both of those case reports originated in Japan.  HBV transmission has been estimated to be 50 to 100 times more likely than the risk of transmission of HIV.  HBV is also more environmentally stable, is resistant to alcohol and some detergents, and to be capable of surviving on environmental surfaces for more than seven days.  The risk of transmission in sport has been estimated at between one transmission in every 10,000 to 50,000 games to one transmission in every 850,000 to 4.25 million games.  These calculations are based on the estimated prevalence of HBV among athletes and it should be appreciated that aggressive and successful HBV immunization programs have been promoted since.  Another study has described the prevalence of HBV infection in athletes as being no different from blood donors of the same age.\n\nParagraph 25: While it takes light approximately 2.54 million years to traverse the gulf of space between Earth and, for instance, the Andromeda Galaxy, it would take a much shorter amount of time from the point of view of a traveler at close to the speed of light due to the effects of time dilation; the time experienced by the traveler depending both on velocity (anything less than the speed of light) and distance traveled (length contraction). Intergalactic travel for humans is therefore possible, in theory, from the point of view of the traveler. For example, a rocket that accelerated at standard acceleration due to gravity toward the Andromeda Galaxy and started to decelerate halfway through the trip would arrive in about 28 years, from the frame of reference of the observer.\n\nParagraph 26: In a speech he gave in 1884, he stated the standard by which all pledges and brothers should be judged by, which is now known as the Jordan Standard. Following graduation from Miami, he studied law, was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Dayton, Ohio and Cincinnati,  during which time he changed his middle initial to M (meaning nothing in particular) to distinguish himself from his brother and law partner Jackson A. Jordan, as he thought people would confuse J.A. and I.A. Jordan.  Isaac Jordan may have been born a Pennsylvania farm boy, but his ambitions were far grander than tending animals and harvesting crops. An important part of his life's journey was set early on when he moved to Ohio with his family and met Ben Runkle, who later described Jordan as a \"playmate of my boyhood, a schoolmate, and a friend for the long and strenuous years of manhood... with boundless energy, lofty ambitions, gifted with untiring perseverance and the ability that made success a certainty.\" Jordan and Runkle, who was two years Jordan's junior, landed at Miami University together for college, and fittingly became fraternity brothers, first as Dekes, then as founders of the new fraternity, Sigma Phi, which later became known as Sigma Chi. Jordan displayed his goal-oriented nature throughout his collegiate career, and it was no surprise that he went straight to law school and practiced as an attorney until he was elected in 1882 to the U.S. Congress. In 1884, Brother Jordan gave a talk in which he outlined his view of the criteria by which a student should be considered for membership in Sigma Chi. That brief statement, which stresses the qualities of good character, became known as \"The Jordan Standard.\" Who knows how far Jordan's ambitious purposes may have taken him had he not died unexpectedly in 1890. What is known is that this self-made man was admired deeply for his relentless energy, broad talents and unwavering dedication to all that he pursued.\n\nParagraph 27: As a veteran, Henry was interested in the decision that the Mississippi legislature had exempted returning veterans from paying the poll tax. Under the poll tax laws, a person had to have paid his poll tax for two years prior to the time that he voted. Therefore, he tried to get black Mississippians to go down to the courthouse to register to vote. However, several veterans, who were non-white, were unable to register. When Henry went to the circuit clerk's office to register, he was rejected, as had been other black Americans. The clerk asked Henry to bring a certificate showing that he was exempt from the poll tax. Although he brought the certificate, the clerk said that Henry still needed to pass various tests to show that he was qualified to vote. He was finally able to register to vote after he read several sections of the state constitution and went satisfactorily through more tests. Henry used the G.I. Bill, a law that provided educational benefits for World War II veterans, to enroll in the pharmacy school at Xavier University. When he graduated in 1950 with a pharmaceutical degree, he married Noelle Michael and went into his own pharmacy business. As a businessman in Clarksdale, he became involved in local and state activities, particularly events such as African-American voter registration. He decided to organize an NAACP branch in Clarksdale because of the incident where two black girls were raped by two white men who were subsequently judged not guilty. W.A. Higgins, who was the principal of the black high school and already a member of NAACP, made the suggestion, and the NAACP national headquarters encouraged Henry and Higgins to organize a local branch of the NAACP. In 1959, Henry was elected president of the Mississippi organization, and served in the NAACP for decades. Henry became close friends with Medgar Evers, who worked as a secretary for the NAACP in 1950. On June 12, 1963, Evers was assassinated in his driveway in Jackson, Mississippi and his assassination had a great impact on Henry.\n\nParagraph 28: Arthur Middleton Young (November 3, 1905 \u2013 May 30, 1995) was an American inventor, helicopter pioneer, cosmologist, philosopher, astrologer, and author. Young was the designer of Bell Helicopter's first helicopter, the Model 30, and inventor of the stabilizer bar used on many of Bell's early helicopter designs. He founded the \"Institute for the Study of Consciousness\" in Berkeley in 1972. Young advocated process philosophy, an attempt to integrate the realm of human thought and experience with the realm of science so that the concept of universe is not limited to that which can be physically measured.  Young's theory embraces evolution and the concept of the great chain of being.  He has influenced such thinkers as Stanislav Grof and Laban Coblentz.\n\nParagraph 29: As a whole, KX Television has long trailed NBC North Dakota in the ratings by a significant margin; the main stations and their satellites are counted as one station for ratings and regulatory purposes. However, KXMC has historically been well ahead of KMOT in the ratings for the northern part of the market. This is largely because it is the only station airing a full schedule of local news for the northern part of the market. Also, KX News Morning has recently surged well ahead of NBC North Dakota's Country Morning Today\u2014the first time in recent memory that NBC North Dakota has lost consecutive ratings periods in any time slot.\n\nParagraph 30: In his review of The Monkey King, writer Ray Olson writes that Terada's artwork \"explodes with energy, overflows with baroque lineation and voluptuous figuration, exploits color like a chameleon with multiple personality disorder.\" His unique pictorial style\u2014which pulls from an internal lexicon of imagined elements\u2014combines Western and Asian comic conventions and motifs. Pulling from this large internal bank of visual vocabulary, he is known for doing hours-long live-drawing events, in which he creates original artworks line-by-line from imagination without sketching, a type of event popularized by Korean artist Kim Jung Gi. He describes his design process as pulling from his internal visual bank: \"I have a habit of looking at objects and imagining how they would transfer from shapes to lines. Over time, I have built a visual library in my head where I am able to pull up these images and details when I need them.\" By drawing lines that he describes as not existing in the natural world, he builds original images, characters, and subjects one pen-stroke at a time. Speaking to his live-drawing practice, Terada notes: \"The drawing starts as soon as the line becomes visible. As the lines start to emerge, you start to see more connections. Things come to a halt when they stop appearing. So, I try to avoid making mistakes. I look closely at what I am doing and go through a catalogue of objects (in my head). I put them together and then start to draw, while questioning if what I am doing is correct. If I check that I haven't made any mistakes, eventually I feel alright with the creation. It might not be a feeling of total satisfaction, but I think this type of journey is what live drawing is all about.\" Over the years his work has spanned a range of media, using water-based markers, paints, brush pens and pencils, as well as digital media. Presently, Terada says that he sketches nearly everything on a 13\" iPad Pro, allowing him to work with speed and freedom.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text tells the story of Henry, a veteran who was interested in the decision to exempt returning veterans from paying the poll tax in Mississippi.

This period ran from September 30 until October 6, due to the newly instituted early voting policy. On August 13, 2008, Brunner ordered county election board officials to establish procedures to enable voters who register to be immediately issued an absentee ballot.  Because a voter could show up with only a cell phone bill, give any four digits and claim they were the last four digits of his or her Social Security Number, and then immediately vote and have such ballots put into the same pool as other votes with no procedure for more rigorous scrutiny of their validity, the Republican Party opposed the same day voting plan and fought it in several Ohio Courts. Ohio Republican Party officials and Republican voters argued in separate lawsuits that Ohio law requires voters to be registered for 30 days before they cast an absentee ballot. On September 29, 2008 (a day after lower state and federal courts overruled GOP objections to same-day registration and voting or GOP requests for mandated ballot segregation and verification) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, Ohio rejected Republican efforts to stop the plan. United States district court judge James Gwin in Cleveland, Ohio also ruled against the Republicans and issued a restraining order to enforce Brunner's plan. In Columbus, Ohio, U.S. District Judge George Smith declined to rule on another statewide challenge, deferring to the state Supreme Court's decision. The rulings, which opened a window to register and vote on the same day until the absentee ballot deadline on October 6, 2008, was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision in which two Republican jurists who were on the November 2008 ballot recused themselves and were replaced by one Republican and one Democrat by Chief Justice Thomas Moyer.  The normal roster of Ohio Supreme Court jurists is all Republican and the lone Democrat replacement, William H. Wolff Jr., cast the tie-breaking vote.  The dissenters noted that Ohio's Constitution requires that a person register to vote 30 days in before voting. Brunner ordered segregation of same-day-registration ballots and verification of them before counting them on Election Day, November 4, 2008.  In related proceedings on September 30, 2008, Judge Smith of The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in Columbus had granted an Ohio Republican Party request for a restraining order that would mandate election observers during early voting.  Brunner prevailed in the appellate court which ruled that the district court \"abused its discretion\" in granting the restraining order.\n\nParagraph 2: Throughout 1990, the KLF launched a series of singles with an upbeat pop-house sound which they dubbed \"stadium house\". Songs from The White Room soundtrack were re-recorded with rap and more vocals (by guests labelled \"Additional Communicators\"), a sample-heavy pop-rock production and crowd noise samples. The first \"stadium house\" single, \"What Time Is Love? (Live from Trancentral)\", released in October 1990, reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart and hit the top-ten internationally. The follow-up, \"3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)\", was an international top-five hit in January 1991, reaching #1 in the UK and #5 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The album The White Room followed in March 1991, reaching #3 in the UK. A substantial reworking of the aborted soundtrack, the album featured a segued series of \"stadium house\" songs followed by downtempo tracks.The KLF's chart success continued with the single \"Last Train to Trancentral\" hitting number two in the UK, and number three on the Eurochart Hot 100. In December 1991, a re-working of a song from 1987, \"Justified & Ancient\" was released, featuring Tammy Wynette. It was another international hit \u2013 peaking at number two in the UK, and number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2013 as was \"America: What Time Is Love?\", a hard, guitar-laden reworking of \"What Time Is Love?\". In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by Depeche Mode (\"Policy of Truth\"), the Moody Boys (\"What Is Dub?\"), and Pet Shop Boys (\"So Hard\" from the Behaviour album, and \"It Must Be Obvious\"). Neil Tennant described the process: \"When they did the remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ... I had to go and sing the vocals again, they did it in a different way. I was impressed that Bill Drummond had written all the chords out and played it on an acoustic guitar, very thorough.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Wizard, at different points, incorporates prog, psychedelic rock, Broadway show tunes, bubblegum pop, and Philadelphia soul. Other influences were drawn from jazz and funk. Schuckett said that Rundgren often spoke of Ravel as his favorite classical composer at the time, although \"I don't think Todd really listened to much funk, so [me and Moogy] were kind of showing him that stuff.\" Musicologist Daniel Harrison likened  Wizard to late 1960s Beach Boys work such as Smiley Smile, specifically in that the albums shared musical aspects such as \"abrupt transitions, mixture of various pop styles, and unusual production effects.\" Harrison added that few artists in this period chose to emulate the Beach Boys' experiments due to the band's poor commercial standing. Overall, music writers have described Wizard as a work of progressive pop, psychedelia and avant-pop. Rundgren said that adapting his sound to meet commercial expectations was never an issue for him since he already made \"so much money from production\", a rare luxury for an artist. He recalled that Bearsville owner Albert Grossman, however, was \"surprisingly\" encouraging of Wizard. Klingman remembered Grossman walking in on a session of \"Da Da Dali\" and found Rundgren singing in an exaggerated Al Jolson voice while the band were purposely playing \"all wrong notes\", and yet \"Albert didn't miss a beat. ... He just kept silent and nodded like everything was fine.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Pratt was appointed a chaplain of the East India Company through his father's influence on Bishop Daniel Wilson in 1838. He became Wilson's domestic chaplain, and in 1850 was appointed Archdeacon of Calcutta. The leisure allowed during his position in India allowed him to pursue mathematics although he noted that it was difficult to work alone and led to long exchanges in the journals of learned societies in Britain. When Bishop Wilson died in 1858, he was nominated for the position of Bishop. He was approved with the influence of Lord Shaftesbury on Lord Palmerston but it was shortly after decided in the wake of the 1857 uprising that no appointee known for missionary work should be appointed. The chosen appointee was instead Bishop Cotton. They held each other in high esteem. In 1864 an order was passed by the Secretary of State in India to retire chaplains after twenty-five years (earlier unlimited). An exception was made for Pratt and he was extended from October 1867 to March 1869 based on pleas from Bishop Cotton. When Pratt wished to resign in 1869, the Secretary of State extended his service to October 1872. After the death of Bishop Cotton in 1866, Pratt started a Hill Schools' Nomination Endowment Fund to help support Bishop Cotton's scheme of starting schools in the pleasant climate of the hills for the benefit of the children of poorer English residents in India who could not afford an education in England. Pratt married Hannah Maria Brown, daughter of George Francis Brown, a Bengal Civil Servant, at Bhagalpur on 6 March 1854. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1866. Pratt served as president of the Calcutta Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals founded by Colesworthey Grant in 1861. He died from cholera when he was on a visit to Ghazipur, India, on 28 December 1871. At the instigation of Bishop Robert Milman, a memorial to Pratt was erected in St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1932 he managed to take over the publication of the Kyipwayay (Progress/Growth) magazine after a false start by the chairman U Thein. He had wanted to be a writer and publisher and grabbed the opportunity. The magazine was a success with most of the day's famous writers on board and with an editorial remit of educating young people in self-improvement, health and moral discipline in the struggle for independence and for building a new united Burma. Regular columns such as Maha Swe's Nei Thu Yein's Fearless Doctrine and Theippan Maung Wa's Letter from Maung Than Gyaung attracted a large readership. The Kyipwayay became the vehicle for a new style and content in Burmese literature known as Hkit san (Testing the Age), a movement started most notably by Theippan Maung Wa, Nwe Soe, Zawgyi, Min Thu Wun, Maung Thuta, Maung Htin and Mya Kaytu. He also wrote articles assuming the pen names Kyipwayay Maung Hla and Maung Kan Kaung. A devout Buddhist and non-violent reformist at heart, he made friends with and his home became a favourite haunt of many politicians such as Aung San, Thakin Than Tun, Thakin Zin and Thakin Ba Koe as well as writers such as Maha Swe, Dagon Taya, Zawana, P Moe Nin, Thukha, Maung Htin and Dr Maung Hpyuu, journalists such as Thuriya U Thein Maung, cartoonists U Ba Galay, U Hein Soon and U Ba Gyan, artist U Ohn Lwin and weightlifters Ka-ya bala U Shein, U Zaw Weik and U Ne Win. The Thuriya (Sun) newspaper was where he had started as a budding writer and where he appeared to have learnt the rudiments of journalism and publishing. U Hla was tall, fair and handsome (Hla incidentally means handsome), and known for his friendly smile, gentle soft-spoken manner, even temper, clean living and generosity.\n\nParagraph 6: The railroad charter was issued in the wake of a controversy over the nature of state-issued corporate charters that led to the first-ever veto by a Massachusetts governor.  In 1826, after several years of lobbying by its proponents, the legislature granted a charter to the Warren Bridge Company for a second bridge connecting Boston to Charlestown.  The proprietors proposed that the bridge would charge tolls for only six years and then become free.  The proprietors of the competing Charles River Bridge, which also charged tolls, objected, claiming that the state had granted it an exclusive charter for that crossing, and prevailed on Lincoln to veto the new charter.  This he did; the veto was overridden in the House but not the Senate.  The veto brought in a storm of criticism from populist supporters of the new bridge, who established the Free Bridge Party and ran William C. Jarvis against Lincoln in the 1827 election.  Lincoln approved the charter when it was resubmitted in 1828, after which the Charles River Bridge proprietors initiated a lawsuit.  With Daniel Webster as their attorney, the case Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge made its way to the United States Supreme Court, which in 1837 ruled that the state had not granted exclusive privileges to the Charles River Bridge proprietors.\n\nParagraph 7: One example is the \u201c Telegrafo Mercantil\u201d\u00a0 where\u00a0 contains a poem in honor of the recently appointed viceroy Joaqu\u00edn del Pino. The ideas of the enlightenment, especially practical and utilitarian knowledge to improve the quality of life, penetrated late in Spain due to isolation, traditionalist ideas and the peninsular Inquisition. It was this need to get Spain out of its growing backwardness, in the face of the development of the other European powers, that made the ministers and royal advisers transform these ideas into \"state policy\" .  The \"enlightened\" economic, social, administrative and political changes had to come from the top down: \"All for the people but without the people.\" In this context, the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata was created in 1776; as well as the Hearing in 1785 and the Consulate of Buenos Aires in 1794. The demographic, economic and bureaucratic growth of Buenos Aires gave rise to the birth of a heterodox elite both within the Church and in the secular sectors abandoning many lawyers and other counsels. Several Spanish Americans traveled to Spain to study, such as Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n (1770-1778), Dean Gregorio Funes (1775-1779) and Manuel Belgrano (1786-1793).  In 1783 the Royal College of San Carlos was inaugurated at the initiative of Viceroy V\u00e9rtiz and the leadership of the reformist canon Juan Baltazar Maciel, possessor of a wide and eclectic library that members of the elite could consult. All these changes not only aimed to increase the fiscal resources of the Crown, they also improved the living conditions of the inhabitants: health through the institution of the Protomedicato in 1780, the lighting of the streets and the reuse of the printing press of the Jesuits abandoned in C\u00f3rdoba which, at the beginning of 1780, was transferred by the order of Viceroy V\u00e9rtiz to Buenos Aires and given property to the Casa de los Ni\u00f1os Foundling for the printing of government documents or cathons and primers used by the Catholic Enlightenment.\n\nParagraph 8: He graduated from the University of Damascus in 1923 with a degree in law, and joined the city government in 1925. At this time he also actively ran his family's estates throughout the country. In the 1930s, he became close associates with leading members of the anti-French National Bloc coalition such as future presidents Hashim al-Atassi and Shukri al-Kuwatli. He remained a longtime supporter of the former, but often quarreled with the latter, whom he accused of being too authoritarian. In 1941 the French appointed him Prime Minister and Acting President, having had no success in finding a viable candidate since the resignation of the nationalist Atassi in 1939. However he was replaced 5 months later with a French loyalist, Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Azm served repeatedly in parliament and in the cabinet from 1943 to 1947. He became a focus of opposition when he resigned from the cabinet in 1945 and lead the forces opposed to Kuwatli's drive to amend the constitution to allow himself a second term in office. Kuwatli prevailed, and Azm ran against him in 1947 and lost. However he accepted the position of envoy to France and served in that capacity for a year. He concluded successful arms purchases from France and later from the Soviet Union. In May 1948, Azm agreed to form a multi-party cabinet under Kuwatli which served until March 1949. He allied himself with France and the United States and attempted to obtain loans from them for domestic development. He traveled frequently to attend United Nations assemblies on the Palestinian problem. Azm clashed with members of the military, especially Chief of Staff Husni al-Za'im. The latter launched a coup d'\u00e9tat on 29 March 1949 and imprisoned both Azm and president Kuwatli. When Za'im was overthrown five months later, Azm returned to parliament as deputy for Damascus and became Minister of Finance. He was also elected into the Constituent Assembly that drafted a new constitution for Syria. He became Prime Minister again under Hashim al-Atassi's second administration, in June 1950, heading three cabinets between then and 1951. Azm closed the border to Lebanese goods in an attempt to prevent the crash of domestic Syrian industry due to rampant Lebanese imports. He also clashed repeatedly with the military because he refused to appoint officers in any of his cabinets, and always reserved the defense portfolio for himself. He also clashed with pro-Hashemite elements in Syrian politics that advocated union with Iraq. Socialists distrusted him because of his aristocratic and wealthy Ottoman background.

That same year, at the age of 16, she recorded the first version of Ed Cobb's ballad, \"Every Little Bit Hurts\", released as a single by Del-Fi Records.  She also recorded duets with Hal Davis for the Minasa and Snap labels, and worked with other local recording artists. After graduating from Jordan High School, she also studied music at Compton Community College. In late 1963, she was invited by Davis to a deejay's party which Motown CEO Berry Gordy Jr. was attending, and lip-synced to Mary Wells' hit \"You Beat Me to the Punch\".  Gordy was impressed by Holloway's looks, and subsequently by her vocal power, and opted to sign her to Motown. Holloway was 17 at the time, and was Motown's first West Coast signing.\n\nParagraph 11: The Binis, also called the Edo people, are people of the South South region of modern Nigeria; they are said to be around 3.8 million as of the 21st Century. They are ruled by monarchs, and are famous for their Benin Bronzes. In the pre-colonial period, they controlled a powerful empire. They are an ethnic group that is primarily found in Edo State, and spread across the Delta, Ondo, and Rivers states of Nigeria in smaller concentrations. The language they speak is called the Edo language. The Bini people are closely related to several other ethnic groups that usually speak Edoid languages, for example the Esan, however it is important to address the fact that the name \"Benin\" (and \"Bini\") is a Portuguese corruption, which came from the word \"Ubinu\", which came into use during the reign of Oba Ewuare the Great, c. 1440. The word \"Ubinu\" was used to depict and portray the royal administrative centre or capital proper of the kingdom, Edo. The word \"Ubinu\" was later corrupted to Bini by a number of mixed ethnicities staying together at the centre, and it was then further corrupted to Benin around the year 1485 at the time when the Portuguese people started making trade relations with Oba Ewuare.\n\nParagraph 12: Carissa is born with a face resembling a monkey. All her life, she and her disfigured family experienced persecution from all the people around her because she is branded as the town jinx. She and her family tried to run away but ended up as a sideshow in a carnival. She was mistreated by everyone and became an object of jokes as well as of disgust. But the happy-go-lucky guy, Mendez is different. Mendez befriended the disfigured Carissa and saw what others failed to see, her beautiful heart. There came a time that Mendez ultimately fell in love with \"the monkey-girl\". Meanwhile, Alicia has a bad feeling that there's something not right in her own house. The famous model has a feeling that her husband, the famous plastic surgeon, Hugo Roldan, is having an affair with her own best friend, Morita. She caught him red-handed and decided to go away. Hugo tried to beg for mercy so she would not go but she still left. Tragically, Alicia's flight crashed in the sea and she was one of the casualties. They never found her body and Hugo is left with nothing but remorse and guilt. If only he could bring back the wife he failed to love with all his heart. That is when he found the half-dead Carissa lying in the streets. Mendez left for work in an island resort to earn money for him and Carissa. While he is away, Shirley, the girl who also likes Mendez, forged his hand writing making Carissa believe that he left her for good. Then an epidemic spread across town and the poor Carissa was stoned by a mob thinking she is the jinx that brought the epidemic. Mendez came back for Carissa but they told him that Carissa died in an accident, then showed to him a fake grave. Now with nothing left in her heart but vengeance, Carissa agrees to be Hugo's test patient for a new revolutionary surgical procedure that could copy another person's face. Carissa studied manners, etiquette, fashion and everything about the high society. Carissa took the identity of Alicia. She is now what Alicia was, Hugo's \"wife\" and a goddess in the fashion industry. She agreed to this arrangement because of 2 reasons; to show gratitude to Hugo and to exact revenge on everyone who made her suffer. She was surprised that Alicia owned a resort and her bodyguard is Mendez. She went to the people that caused her pain and showed Mendez how she made them suffer. With the change of her face, her heart also changed. But still, Mendez could not explain why he is falling for a \"horrible\" woman like \"Alicia\". She was supposed to punish him but ended up falling for him even more. She can't bear her feelings anymore now that she knows what Shirley actually did. She told everything to Mendez and the lovers picked up where they left off. They had an \"affair\" but she is afraid what would Hugo do now that she saw Hugo's evil side. She then learns about the dark secrets of the face she now possess. Secrets that could ruin Hugo and bring back to Mendez what was stolen from him. Mendez's father, Dr. Pedroza was a famous plastic surgeon who created the procedure. But young, ambitious doctor Hugo stole the plan then made it as his own, destroying Dr. Pedroza's reputation. He then seduced Mrs. Pedroza which led to the heart attack and death of Dr. Pedroza, leaving the poor kid, Mendez with nothing that's why he grew up in the streets. Hugo then experimented on countless women like Carissa but ended up with dead patients including Carissa's sister. Now, Carissa just wants to leave with Mendez and hatched a plan to take Hugo's wealth that is really for Mendez. But will their plan prevail? Now that Hugo has also a plan as diabolical as their own.\n\nParagraph 13: On the October 18 episode of Raw is War, Big Boss Man challenged Big Show to a match and agreed to defend the WWF Hardcore Championship. Big Show accepted the challenge. However, before the match Big Show left the arena to check on his father, who had reportedly died (in storyline). The report was later revealed as a plan of Boss Man. On the October 21 episode of SmackDown, an enraged Big Show attempted to attack Boss Man but Boss Man escaped. Big Show then assaulted the police officer. On the October 25 episode of Raw is War, Boss Man distracted Big Show during his match with Prince Albert. Albert attacked Big Show from behind and Boss Man broke Big Show's father's watch with a hammer. As a result, Boss Man and Albert formed a new alliance. On the October 28 episode of SmackDown, Al Snow had a match with Boss Man. However, Boss Man's ally, Albert continuously interfered in the match and the two attacked Snow, leading him to challenge both men to a Hardcore match in the parking lot. Later that night, Boss Man and Albert went to the parking lot to wrestle Snow but instead of Snow, Big Show appeared. He trapped Boss Man and Albert in a car, smashed it into pieces and pushed a dumpster on the top of the car. On the November 1 episode of Raw is War, Boss Man and Albert attacked Big Show during an interview. On the November 8 episode of Raw is War, a tribute was paid to Big Show's father on his death. Boss Man came out and insulted Big Show and his father. On the November 11 episode of SmackDown, footage was shown of Boss Man interrupting the funeral, attacking Big Show and ruining the grave. This led to a Survivor Series match between Big Show's team (consisting of Kai En Tai (Funaki and Taka Michinoku) and The Blue Meanie) and Boss Man's team (consisting of Prince Albert, Viscera and Mideon). On the November 14 episode of Sunday Night Heat, Big Show attacked all of his team members, who withdrew from the team, making the match a 4-on-1 Survivor Series match.\n\nParagraph 14: WritingThe Incredible Melting Man was written and directed by filmmaker William Sachs. The idea for the film came to him when his mother, working in the office of a spray paint company, showed him \"gooey stuff\" which was used as a basis for spray paint and jokingly suggested that he should do a film featuring that material. During writing, Sachs was influenced by The Night of the Living Dead and wanted to give the film a 1950s horror film feeling. But the final film, with its structure changed by the producers in post-production, has been described by some sources \u2013 including the film magazine Cinefantastique and the 1995 book Cult Science Fiction Films \u2013 as a remake of First Man into Space (1959), another film about an astronaut who becomes a monster after an accident in space. Science fiction film historian Gene Wright suggested that the final film was heavily influenced by The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), a British horror film about an astronaut who begins mutating into an alien organism after a spaceflight. Sachs, however, had never seen either of those films, and his original screenplay had a very different structure. He had originally written the script for The Incredible Melting Man as a parody of horror films. According to Michael Adams, a film reviewer who interviewed Sachs, this was the reason that the film mixed horror with comedic moments, such as when Steve West's detached ear gets stuck on a tree, and when a janitor sweeps West's melted body into a garbage can at the end of the film. Adams claims that this explains several comedic lines of dialogue otherwise inconsistent with the rest of the film, including one moment when homeless men notice the melting West and say to each other, \"You think we've got trouble, look at that dude\". In Sachs' original version, the film opened with the wide-angle shot of the nurse running through the hallway; this would not have been in slow motion, unlike the final film, where the producers played it back slowed down. Only later would viewers have gradually learned the background of the melting man. All the scenes showing the astronauts in space and the lead character in the hospital were re-shot during post-production without influence by the director, and Sachs criticized both the acting in those scenes and how they restructure the film. There are logical problems in the final film due to the re-shot scenes; it is never fully explained how West's spacecraft returned to Earth from Saturn when West himself was so seriously injured and the other two members of his crew were both killed.\n\nParagraph 15: George Harrison guest stars in the episode as himself. He was the second Beatles member after Ringo Starr (in \"Brush with Greatness\") to appear on The Simpsons. When Harrison arrived at the recording studio in West Los Angeles to record his lines, the casting director told the episode's show runners, Al Jean and Mike Reiss, that Harrison was coming and that they were not allowed to tell anybody about it because it was intended to be a secret to the staff. Jean, Reiss, and the show's creator Matt Groening went to see Harrison in the studio, and when they returned to the writer's room, Groening, unaware that it was supposed to be a secret, said, \"Guess who I just met! George Harrison!\" Harrison arrived at the studio by himself, without any entourage or bodyguards. Groening recalls that Harrison was \"pretty glum,\" and he was unenthusiastic when the staff asked him questions about the Beatles. However, when Groening asked Harrison about the Wonderwall Music album, he suddenly \"perked up\" because it was one of his solo albums that he was rarely questioned on. Harrison's guest appearance was one of Groening's favorites because he was \"super nice\" and \"very sweet\" to the staff. Jean said it was a \"huge thrill\" to have him appear. David Crosby also makes a guest appearance in the episode as himself, and appears in the scene in which he presents a Grammy Award to the Be Sharps.\n\nParagraph 16: Less than a year later, the center of the project had shifted to the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Manley received a personal call from Leo Szilard to move from the Metallurgical Laboratory to Los Alamos and on April 4, 1943, Manley arrived at the laboratory. Manley spent his first days in Los Alamos working with other newcomers on the construction of laboratory buildings. He also installed a Cockcroft\u2013Walton generator, which he had brought with him from Urbana. Throughout the war Manley served as one of Oppenheimer's principal aides, with particular responsibility for laboratory management. His wife Kay moved to Los Alamos in June 1943, following the birth of their second daughter. She was hired as a human computer in the T (Theoretical) Division but then quit after six months to focus on raising their children.\n\nParagraph 17: There are two envelope glycoproteins. The G glycoprotein ectodomain assembles as a homotetramer to form the viral anti-receptor or attachment protein, which binds to the receptor on the host cell. Each strand in the ectodomain consists of four distinct regions: at the N-terminal and connecting to the viral surface is the helical stalk, followed by the beta-sandwich neck domain, the linker region and finally, at the C-terminal, four heads which contain host cell receptor binding domains.  Each head consists of a beta-propellor structure with six blades. There are three unique folding patterns of the heads, resulting in a 2-up/2-down configuration where two heads are positioned distal to the virus and two heads are proximal. Due to the folding patterns and subsequent arrangement of the heads, only one of the four heads is positioned with its binding site accessible to associate with the host B2/B3 receptor. The G protein head domain is also highly antigenic, inducing head-specific antibodies in primate models. As such, it is a prime target for vaccine development as well as antibody therapy. One head-specific antibody, m102.4, has been used in compassionate use cases and has completed Phase 1 clinical trials.  The F glycoprotein forms a trimer, which mediates membrane fusion.\n\nParagraph 18: The video of this song was directed by Jim Shea, and features footage of Paisley singing in a forest, as well as home movies of himself with his grandfather, Warren L. Jarvis. He also holds up photos of himself with Jarvis and his aunt Rita Takach. The video was filmed in Northern California. The extended version of the video ends with Jarvis in a home movie saying \"Come on in and rock a while!\" and Paisley smiling when he looks up from his guitar playing and sees this. It also features many different people holding photographs of loved ones who have presumably died. Two notable people featured in this video are Michael Reagan, who is shown holding a photograph of his father Ronald Reagan, and Teresa Earnhardt, who is shown sitting in front of a painted portrait of her husband, NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt. Although she does vocals on the song, Dolly Parton is off camera singing in the video. However, she is shown holding a picture of her grandfather, Rev. Jake Owens, who'd died a few years earlier. She kisses her hand then touches the photograph in this scene. Figure Skater Scott Hamilton is shown holding a picture of his mother. John Carter Cash is featured holding a photo of his parents, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Also in the video is Pixar director John Lasseter holding up a picture of co-director and fellow CalArts alumnus Joe Ranft who suddenly died in 2005 in a car accident.  Various unknown people hold up photos of relatives who have passed on throughout as well. In 2007, after the Virginia Tech massacre, the last slide was dedicated to those lost with the VT emblem shining brightly. On tour in 2008, Paisley also added a picture of late actor Heath Ledger.\n\nParagraph 19:  Mouse (voiced by Louise Vallance) knew Bob from back when he arrested her from trying to hack into the Super-Computer. A hacker extraordinaire with a sugary Southern accent, she is equipped with a katana to cut her enemies into small pieces, and a high-tech craft called Ship. Sometimes she is seen with another, smaller sword, but she rarely uses it. It is probably a wakizashi to complete a samurai's daisho, which consists of the two aforementioned swords.  She is first mentioned in the episode \"The Crimson Binome\", which hints at an untold encounter between Mouse and the pirate crew of the Saucy Mare; Bob, imprisoned in the ship's brig, finds Mouse's calling card (a stylized drawing of a mouse) on the wall, a clue to an avenue of escape.  She first appears on-screen in \"The Great Brain Robbery\", hired as a mercenary by Megabyte (during the episode, she calls him \"big guy\" and \"Megababe\"); she turned against him when it became obvious she had been double-crossed and was endangering a young child. She later returned in Season 2 to save Bob and Dot from Gigabyte and ended up as part of the main cast from then on. She had been hired by the Guardians to discover if there was a Web Creature in Mainframe; during the subsequent Web War and then the Viral Wars, Mouse's hacking skills became a major asset in thwarting Mainframe's enemies, including developing a Firewall so complex that Daemon could not get through it, and was blocked from multiple Systems.  Due to her invaluable assistance, Mouse is allowed to upgrade her icon (and AndrAIa's as well) to a full Mainframe icon which, among other things, created a backup of her that allowed her to be restored along with the native Mainframers after the system crashed (\"End Prog\").\n\nParagraph 20: Tikki Tikki Tembo is set in ancient China and invents an ancient Chinese custom whereby parents honor their first-born sons with long, elaborate names that everyone is obliged to say completelyno nicknames, no shortening of any kindwhile second-born sons are typically given short, unimportant names.  A boy named Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo (\"The Most Wonderful Thing in the Whole Wide World\") and his little brother Chang (\"Little or Nothing\") are playing very close to a well at their house that their mother has warned them to avoid. Chang falls in the well and his older brother runs to their mother and tells her Chang has fallen down the well. Their mother tells him to get the Old Man with the Ladder. He goes and tells the Old Man. Chang is rescued and then recovers quickly. Some time later, the boys are again playing near the well. This time, the older brother falls in. Chang runs to their mother and tries to tell her that \"Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo has fallen into the well.\" At first she cannot hear him so he says it again. However, because Chang is out of breath from running he sputters and then mispronounces the name. His mother insists that he repeat the namebut with respect. He tries repeatedly until finally his mother tells Chang to get the Old Man with the Ladder. Chang goes to the Old Man with the Ladder. Initially, the old man does not respond because he is asleep. Further, when Chang tries to wake him up, the Old Man with the Ladderannoyedtries to fall back asleep. After Chang breathlessly repeats his brother's predicament the Old Man goes with Chang to save his brother from the well. They get Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo from the well, but because of the long time he was in the well, it takes longer for him to recover. The end of the story says that this is why the Chinese have short names.\n\nParagraph 21: Music for Relief contributed $57,000 in 2011 for the planting of 57,000 trees with The Nature Conservancy in Brazil's Atlantic Forest for their Plant A Billion Trees campaign. Only 12% of the Atlantic Forest's original area remains and only 7% is well conserved. It is one of the world's most endangered tropical forests, threatened by coastal development, urban expansion, and illegal logging. The forest provides clean water and hydro energy for over 130 million Brazilians and is home to an extraordinary array of biodiversity found nowhere else on earth. Much of what remains of the forest is found in isolated fragments, which are often too small to support a full array of its extraordinary biodiversity.\n\nParagraph 22: Scribner's Magazine was the second periodical publication of the  Scribner's  firm, after Scribner's Monthly was published from 1870 to 1881. Scribner's Monthly was later moved to another publisher, and renamed The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Charles Scribner announced to a New York Times reporter that they would make a new monthly publication \"as soon as the necessary arrangements could be perfected\". It was also announced that the editor would be Edward Burlingame, the son of Anson Burlingame, who was already connected to the publishing house as literary adviser. Charles Scribner also noted that the magazine would not be a revival of the formerly published Scribner's Monthly. Charles Scribner's Sons spent over $500,000 in launching Scribner's Magazine   to compete with the already successful pictorials, The Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine. Burlingame hired the best artists in his country for the magazine; Howard Pyle, Howard Chandler Christy, Charles Marion Russell, Walter Everett, Maxfield Parrish and Frederic Remington. Before the first issue was released, Charles Scribner's Sons had their first annual \"Scribner's Magazine\" dinner at their main offices. Scribner's Magazine was launched in January 1887, the first issue of which was to be published from January to June of that year. The magazine was printed and bound by Trow's Printing and Bookbinding Company. Scribner's Magazine was also the first magazine to introduce color illustrations later on. The first issue opens with the literary article \"The Downfall to the Empire\". by E.B. Washburne, the former minister to France. An early morning fire in 1908 at the Charles Scribner's Sons offices heavily burned the third and fourth floors, where the  magazine was produced. In May 1914, the magazine's editor, Edward L. Burlingame, retired and Robert Bridges took over as editor. (Bridges was a lifelong close friend of President Woodrow Wilson ever since the two had met as students at Princeton University.)  During the First World War, the magazine employed authors, Richard Harding Davis, Edith Wharton and John Galsworthy, to write about the major conflict. During the time of 1917, when the United States joined the war, the magazine had four to six articles on the subject. On the date of November 19, 1922, the first editor of the magazine, Edward L. Burlingame, died. In January 1928 the magazine had a change in format, with the first of the newly formatted issue having a cover design by Rockwell Kent.\n\nParagraph 23: In the third approach, disk operations are virtualized and are actually translated into a network protocol. The data that is usually stored in a disk drive are then stored in virtual disks files homed on a server. The disk operations such as requests to read/write disk sectors are translated into corresponding network requests and processed by a service or daemon running on the server side. This is the implementation that is used by Neoware Image Manager, Ardence, VHD Central Management System and various \"boot over iSCSI\" products. This third approach differs from the first approach because what is remote is not a file system but actually a disk device (or raw device) and that the client OS is not aware that it is not running off a hard disk. This is why this approach is sometimes named \"Virtual Hard Disk\" or \"Network Virtual Disk\".\n\nParagraph 24: Hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Human immunodeficiency virus infection are classical examples of blood-borne diseases.  Unlike hepatitis A, which is spread by the fecal-oral route and is indicative of a breakdown in food safety or potable water protection, hepatitis B, C and HIV are spread by contact with bodily fluids, most frequently blood, although in the case of HIV, not exclusively so.  Also, unlike hepatitis A in which the sufferer almost always recovers completely, or rarely dies, both hepatitis B and C often give rise to chronic carrier states and indolent disease in many.  At present, Hepatitis C is the most common reason for liver transplantation in the US while HIV is currently incurable although its clinical course can be modified.  In any case, between them, they have changed awareness of infectious disease in sports, and certainly changed management on the playing surface.  Ironically, evidence for transmission of any of the three as a result of injury and/or contact on the playing surface is exceedingly limited and the greatest risk to the athlete surrounds behavior that may take place off court.  A case report in 1982 described 5 of 10 members of a Japanese high school sumo wrestling club who contracted hepatitis.  It was hypothesized that spread had occurred through skin cuts and abrasions. An outbreak of HBV in an American football team was reported in 2000.  Eleven of 65 athletes were found to be HBV positive in a 19-month surveillance period.  Contact with open wounds of an HBV carrier was again hypothesized. Both of those case reports originated in Japan.  HBV transmission has been estimated to be 50 to 100 times more likely than the risk of transmission of HIV.  HBV is also more environmentally stable, is resistant to alcohol and some detergents, and to be capable of surviving on environmental surfaces for more than seven days.  The risk of transmission in sport has been estimated at between one transmission in every 10,000 to 50,000 games to one transmission in every 850,000 to 4.25 million games.  These calculations are based on the estimated prevalence of HBV among athletes and it should be appreciated that aggressive and successful HBV immunization programs have been promoted since.  Another study has described the prevalence of HBV infection in athletes as being no different from blood donors of the same age.\n\nParagraph 25: While it takes light approximately 2.54 million years to traverse the gulf of space between Earth and, for instance, the Andromeda Galaxy, it would take a much shorter amount of time from the point of view of a traveler at close to the speed of light due to the effects of time dilation; the time experienced by the traveler depending both on velocity (anything less than the speed of light) and distance traveled (length contraction). Intergalactic travel for humans is therefore possible, in theory, from the point of view of the traveler. For example, a rocket that accelerated at standard acceleration due to gravity toward the Andromeda Galaxy and started to decelerate halfway through the trip would arrive in about 28 years, from the frame of reference of the observer.\n\nParagraph 26: In a speech he gave in 1884, he stated the standard by which all pledges and brothers should be judged by, which is now known as the Jordan Standard. Following graduation from Miami, he studied law, was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Dayton, Ohio and Cincinnati,  during which time he changed his middle initial to M (meaning nothing in particular) to distinguish himself from his brother and law partner Jackson A. Jordan, as he thought people would confuse J.A. and I.A. Jordan.  Isaac Jordan may have been born a Pennsylvania farm boy, but his ambitions were far grander than tending animals and harvesting crops. An important part of his life's journey was set early on when he moved to Ohio with his family and met Ben Runkle, who later described Jordan as a \"playmate of my boyhood, a schoolmate, and a friend for the long and strenuous years of manhood... with boundless energy, lofty ambitions, gifted with untiring perseverance and the ability that made success a certainty.\" Jordan and Runkle, who was two years Jordan's junior, landed at Miami University together for college, and fittingly became fraternity brothers, first as Dekes, then as founders of the new fraternity, Sigma Phi, which later became known as Sigma Chi. Jordan displayed his goal-oriented nature throughout his collegiate career, and it was no surprise that he went straight to law school and practiced as an attorney until he was elected in 1882 to the U.S. Congress. In 1884, Brother Jordan gave a talk in which he outlined his view of the criteria by which a student should be considered for membership in Sigma Chi. That brief statement, which stresses the qualities of good character, became known as \"The Jordan Standard.\" Who knows how far Jordan's ambitious purposes may have taken him had he not died unexpectedly in 1890. What is known is that this self-made man was admired deeply for his relentless energy, broad talents and unwavering dedication to all that he pursued.\n\nParagraph 27: As a veteran, Henry was interested in the decision that the Mississippi legislature had exempted returning veterans from paying the poll tax. Under the poll tax laws, a person had to have paid his poll tax for two years prior to the time that he voted. Therefore, he tried to get black Mississippians to go down to the courthouse to register to vote. However, several veterans, who were non-white, were unable to register. When Henry went to the circuit clerk's office to register, he was rejected, as had been other black Americans. The clerk asked Henry to bring a certificate showing that he was exempt from the poll tax. Although he brought the certificate, the clerk said that Henry still needed to pass various tests to show that he was qualified to vote. He was finally able to register to vote after he read several sections of the state constitution and went satisfactorily through more tests. Henry used the G.I. Bill, a law that provided educational benefits for World War II veterans, to enroll in the pharmacy school at Xavier University. When he graduated in 1950 with a pharmaceutical degree, he married Noelle Michael and went into his own pharmacy business. As a businessman in Clarksdale, he became involved in local and state activities, particularly events such as African-American voter registration. He decided to organize an NAACP branch in Clarksdale because of the incident where two black girls were raped by two white men who were subsequently judged not guilty. W.A. Higgins, who was the principal of the black high school and already a member of NAACP, made the suggestion, and the NAACP national headquarters encouraged Henry and Higgins to organize a local branch of the NAACP. In 1959, Henry was elected president of the Mississippi organization, and served in the NAACP for decades. Henry became close friends with Medgar Evers, who worked as a secretary for the NAACP in 1950. On June 12, 1963, Evers was assassinated in his driveway in Jackson, Mississippi and his assassination had a great impact on Henry.\n\nParagraph 28: Arthur Middleton Young (November 3, 1905 \u2013 May 30, 1995) was an American inventor, helicopter pioneer, cosmologist, philosopher, astrologer, and author. Young was the designer of Bell Helicopter's first helicopter, the Model 30, and inventor of the stabilizer bar used on many of Bell's early helicopter designs. He founded the \"Institute for the Study of Consciousness\" in Berkeley in 1972. Young advocated process philosophy, an attempt to integrate the realm of human thought and experience with the realm of science so that the concept of universe is not limited to that which can be physically measured.  Young's theory embraces evolution and the concept of the great chain of being.  He has influenced such thinkers as Stanislav Grof and Laban Coblentz.\n\nParagraph 29: As a whole, KX Television has long trailed NBC North Dakota in the ratings by a significant margin; the main stations and their satellites are counted as one station for ratings and regulatory purposes. However, KXMC has historically been well ahead of KMOT in the ratings for the northern part of the market. This is largely because it is the only station airing a full schedule of local news for the northern part of the market. Also, KX News Morning has recently surged well ahead of NBC North Dakota's Country Morning Today\u2014the first time in recent memory that NBC North Dakota has lost consecutive ratings periods in any time slot.\n\nParagraph 30: In his review of The Monkey King, writer Ray Olson writes that Terada's artwork \"explodes with energy, overflows with baroque lineation and voluptuous figuration, exploits color like a chameleon with multiple personality disorder.\" His unique pictorial style\u2014which pulls from an internal lexicon of imagined elements\u2014combines Western and Asian comic conventions and motifs. Pulling from this large internal bank of visual vocabulary, he is known for doing hours-long live-drawing events, in which he creates original artworks line-by-line from imagination without sketching, a type of event popularized by Korean artist Kim Jung Gi. He describes his design process as pulling from his internal visual bank: \"I have a habit of looking at objects and imagining how they would transfer from shapes to lines. Over time, I have built a visual library in my head where I am able to pull up these images and details when I need them.\" By drawing lines that he describes as not existing in the natural world, he builds original images, characters, and subjects one pen-stroke at a time. Speaking to his live-drawing practice, Terada notes: \"The drawing starts as soon as the line becomes visible. As the lines start to emerge, you start to see more connections. Things come to a halt when they stop appearing. So, I try to avoid making mistakes. I look closely at what I am doing and go through a catalogue of objects (in my head). I put them together and then start to draw, while questioning if what I am doing is correct. If I check that I haven't made any mistakes, eventually I feel alright with the creation. It might not be a feeling of total satisfaction, but I think this type of journey is what live drawing is all about.\" Over the years his work has spanned a range of media, using water-based markers, paints, brush pens and pencils, as well as digital media. Presently, Terada says that he sketches nearly everything on a 13\" iPad Pro, allowing him to work with speed and freedom.", "answers": ["Paragraph 27"], "pred": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,", "length": 8995, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c795443150fa323af09da5a7a90c92df40234f1dadda9c36"}
{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: The Lake Causeway (Calzada del Lago in Spanish) runs north from the lake shore to the city centre, where it continues as Via 5. The total length of the causeway and the via is around . The Lake Causeway was designed to allow the rapid movement of goods and people between the city and the lake, and easy access to water. The Lake Causeway probably developed from a Middle Preclassic pathway that ran between the shore and the early settlement. The earliest version of the Lake Causeway was built in the Late Preclassic; it was about  wide and was raised  above natural ground level. The Via 5 continuation did not exist in the Late Preclassic, when the later city centre had not yet developed. During the Late Classic the causeway was further developed and extended with the formal construction of Via 5 running across the site core. The point where the two met was deliberately narrowed with the construction of flanking buildings and is likely to have been a guardpost where access to the site core was controlled. It is likely that travellers and goods arriving at the city were inspected and taxed at this control point. At its narrowest point the entrance from the causeway to Via 5 was just  wide. Parapets were erected flanking the Lake Causeway; they stood approximately  high and varied from  wide. The southern extreme of the causeway was modified with the construction of a stucco-covered platform with masonry walls defining the east and south sides. From the southern end of the causeway to the union with Via 5 there is an approximate difference in altitude of more than . There is some evidence that steps were carved from the limestone bedrock where the southern platform met the Lake Causeway. During a second phase of construction in the Late Classic, the southern platform was enlarged to measure  east-west by  north-south. The platform was supported on the south and east sides by refurbished talud walls coated in stucco. The causeway itself was redesigned as a long ramp that joined the southern platform with the city centre and the junction with Via 5. In the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800\u2013900) the southern end of the Lake Causeway was re-dressed with limestone fill. The stepped sides of the southern platform were filled in and covered with stone to form ramps. At about this time Stela A, a plain monument, was erected on the platform. Also in the Terminal Classic the restrictions at the north end of the causeway where it met Via 5 were removed; the whole area was levelled with finely dressed stone and mortar that left the access free for the entire width of the causeway. Ceramic remains recovered from the Lake Causeway are scarce and poorly preserved due to the strong waterflow along the incline caused during the rain season, resulting in artefacts being eroded and washed downhill towards the lake.\n\nParagraph 2: Mordashov is the son of Russian parents, who were both steel mill workers. According to Mordashov, his family used welfare coupons, allowed only 200g of butter and 400g of sausages per month. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Leningrad Engineering-Economical Institute, currently known as ENGECON. He later gained an MBA from Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in 2001. In an address to students at the European University at Saint Petersburg, Mordashov spoke about his decision to study in Leningrad rather than Moscow and the value his undergraduate studies played in his search for employment and eventual career path. Returning to Cherepovets, he started his career by joining the same steel plant where his parents had worked.\n\nParagraph 3: Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the University of Cambridge with honours in Mathematics (equal Third Wrangler), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had. She saved enough money to buy into the business with her sister, and she now owns (with Sir George) a chain of brothels across Europe. Vivie is, at first, horrified by the revelation, but then lauds her mother as a champion. However, the reconciliation ends when Vivie finds out that her mother continues to run the business even though she no longer needs to. Vivie takes an office job in the city and dumps Frank, vowing she will never marry. She disowns her mother, and Mrs. Warren is left heartbroken, having looked forward to growing old with her daughter.\n\nParagraph 4: Ayres Borghi-Zerni was born in Buenos Aires in 1895 to a musical family. Her father was Edgardo Zerni, an Italian operatic tenor of modest reputation, and her aunt was Adele Borghi, a prominent mezzo-soprano admired by Giuseppe Verdi himself. Little is known about Ayres's early years. She studied singing in Milan under a teacher called Bonanno and made her debut in 1914 at the Teatro dal Verme as Micaela in Georges Bizet's Carmen. In the next two years she made a number of successful appearances on Italian provincial stages, amongst which was the Teatro della Pergola in Florence where in 1916 she appeared as Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto. In 1917 Ayres Borghi-Zerni toured South America, where she sang Lucia di Lammermoor in Gaetano Donizetti's opera of the same title and Violetta in Verdi's La traviata at the Gran Teatro de La Habana, National Theatre of Venezuela and the Teatro Arbeu in Mexico. The following year Ayres Borghi-Zerni made her first appearance at an important Italian opera house - Teatro Comunale di Bologna, where she performed Gilda in Rigoletto and Amina in Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula. This signed the beginning of her important career: in the following ten years (1918-1928) Borghi-Zerni was invited to sing at the most prominent theatres of Italy, amongst which were the Teatro Costanzi in Rome (in 1918 and 1922), the Teatro Massimo in Palermo (in 1919), the Teatro San Carlo in Naples (in 1919, 1920, 1924, 1925 and 1928), the Teatro La Fenice in Venice (in 1921, 1926 and 1927) and the Teatro Regio in Turin (in 1922). It seems quite strange, though, that she never appeared at the Teatro alla Scala. Apart from the greatest Italian stages, Borghi-Zerni was tremendously successful in at The Royal Opera House in London, where in 1919 she sang Violetta in La traviata. She also made guest appearances at the Teatro Liceo in Barcelona (also in 1919, in Gioacchino Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Lucia di Lammermoor and  Rigoletto) and the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo (in 1920, in La traviata, Rigoletto (as a partner of the great tenor Beniamino Gigli) and the world premiere of Raoul Gunsbourg's new opera Satan). Ayres Borghi-Zerni's career did not last long, as she seems to have retired from the stage in 1928. She gave her last performances as Violetta and Lucia in 1928 (at the Teatro San Carlo and Politeama Reinach in Parma), and after this point her life is unknown.\n\nParagraph 5: The Dodgers began the month of June where they left off in May, losing their fifth straight game. This time they committed four errors and were pounded by the Colorado Rockies 13\u20133 at Coors Field. In that game, the Dodgers set a Major League record by having five sons of former Major Leaguers in the lineup at the same time (Tony Gwynn Jr., Jerry Hairston Jr., Iv\u00e1n DeJes\u00fas Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. The losing streak came to an end the next day, when they got a strong pitching performance from Aaron Harang and some timely hitting, including Bobby Abreu's first homer as a Dodger, in a 6\u20132 win. However, the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation the next day as they dropped the series finale to the Rockies 3\u20132. The Dodgers road trip continued on June 4 as they traveled to Citizens Bank Park to open a four-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Dee Gordon hit a triple to lead off the ninth against Phillies closer Jonathan Papelbon and then scored on a single by Eli\u00e1n Herrera to give the Dodgers the winning margin in the 4\u20133 victory. Herrera came through the next night as well, hitting a two-RBI double off Cliff Lee in the top of the eighth to give the Dodgers the go-ahead run in a 2\u20131 victory over the Phillies. Dee Gordon delivered a two-run single during the Dodgers three-run sixth inning on June 6 as they again came from behind to beat the Phillies, this time by a score of 6\u20135. Kenley Jansen picked up his third save in three days against the Phillies. The Dodgers, helped by three Phillies errors, swept the series with an 8\u20133 victory in the series finale. The victory was the 100th career win for pitcher Aaron Harang and the team's first ever four-game series sweep in Philadelphia. The Dodgers continued the lengthy road trip with a cross-country flight to Seattle to take on the Mariners in interleague play. In the opener Nathan Eovaldi pitched six scoreless innings before the Mariners got a run off of relief pitcher Scott Elbert. It was all they needed because Kevin Millwood and five relief pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Dodgers. This was the first official no-hitter against the Dodgers since Kent Mercker of the Atlanta Braves had done it on April 4, 1994. The Dodgers got back into the winning ways the next day as Clayton Kershaw stuck out a season-high 12 batters in 7 innings and Jerry Hairston Jr. hit a home run and had 5 RBI in the 8\u20133 win. Andre Ethier hit his fourth career grand slam to back Chad Billingsley's strong effort as the Dodgers closed out the lengthy road trip with an 8\u20132 victory over the Mariners. Billingsley allowed only one run in 7 innings while striking out 8.\n\nParagraph 6: The original SMA correlator was designed to correlate 2 GHz of IF bandwidth per sideband from each of two active receivers in eight antennas, producing spectral data for 28 baselines.    Because the analog-to-digital converters sampled at 208 MHz, the IF was downconverted into 24 partially overlapping \"chunks\", each 104 MHz wide, before sampling.  After sampling, the data were sent to 90 large PC boards, each of which held 32 ASIC correlator chips.   The correlator was an XF design; in the default configuration 6144 lags were calculated for each of two receivers on 28 baselines, before an FFT was applied to convert the lag data to spectra.   In the default configuration the spectral resolution was 812.5 kHz per channel, but the correlator could be reconfigured to increase the spectral resolution on certain chunks, at the expense of lower resolution elsewhere in the spectrum.  The correlator chips were designed at MIT Haystack, and funded by five institutions: SMA, USNO, NASA, NRFA and JIVE.    The correlator could also be configured to correlate all 45 baselines produced by adding the CSO and JCMT to the array, but only for a single receiver per antenna.\n\nParagraph 7: Enric Valor was born in 1911,  the son of an affluent family from Castalla, in the Valencian comarca of l'Alcoi\u00e0. In 1930, at the age of nineteen, he became a journalist in Alicante writing in the satirical newspaper El Tio Cuc, in Valencian. During the Second Spanish Republic he started to become politically active. His main demand was for autonomous status for the Land of Valencia. He was also at this time working in the city of Valencia in the nationalist newspapers  La Rep\u00fablica de les Lletres, El Cam\u00ed and El Pa\u00eds Valenci\u00e0. When the Spanish Civil War broke out he supported the Spanish Republic.\n\nParagraph 8: On January 1, 1868, construction began on the first line connecting Denver and Golden. On January 14, the company changed its name to Colorado Central Railroad.  Construction of the first line was slow. By the end of the year, only the small portion (less than 12 miles) between Denver and Golden had been graded. In the meantime, former Territorial Governor John Evans (co-conspirator of the Sand Creek Massacre) and other business leaders from Denver City, including David Moffat, William Byers (Rocky Mountain News), Joseph E. Bates, Bela Hughes, Walter Cheesman (Denver Water) and Luther Kountze (Colorado National Bank), formed the Denver Pacific Railway on November 19, 1867, with the intention of building a rail line from Denver to Cheyenne. The formation of the Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company set off an intense struggle over the next two years between the two companies to complete their lines connecting to Union Pacific. By the following year, the success of the Denver Pacific investors in persuading the United States Congress to grant them land allowing them to construct a line throughout the South Platte River valley to Cheyenne made it evident that Denver would prevail over Golden. The Denver Pacific line was complete in June 1870 and the first train arrived in Denver from Cheyenne, bypassing Golden. Two months later, the Kansas Pacific completed its line to Denver, linking up with the Denver Pacific, and cementing the central role of Denver in Colorado.\n\nParagraph 9: \"It is told of him, as showing his strength and endurance, that when repairs were needed for the mill, that he would mount a horse and carry the part \u2013 often of heavy iron \u2013 to Montreal, get it mended and without stopping to rest, would ride back to Hull, making a journey of 240 miles through a wild country, under the most tiring conditions.\"\"I recently met an old resident of the Township, who remembered many of the pioneers. He was one of those rare beings who seemed to remember only the good qualities of the men he had known. \"Another kind hearted man\" said he \"was Andy Leamy. I've known him to be driving along the road with a load of supplies for his lumber camp, and passing the hovel of a family in need, throw off a barrel of flour and pass on as though he thought nothing of it. Andy didn't make much pretense of being a saint, but he did a whole lot of good all the same.\"John Lowrey Gourlay wrote this passage about an incident of a religious nature that occurred in 1835 in Wright's Town, when Leamy was 19 years-old:\"A man of fervor, (Reverend) Burwell, declared to his people from the pulpit, and in the parlor, shop and store, his newly-found views that struck most people with the force of all new ideas. His success in Hull seemed considerable, several influential people becoming obedient to the new faith. \u2026 Nevertheless the mob in Hull undertook to dictate to those who took up the new opinions, or at least to greatly disturb their meetings. \u2026 The late Andrew Leamy, a famous old warrior, took sometimes an active hand in these troubles. Often from sharp and angry words they went to blows, marking each others face's very picturesquely. ... Rev. Adam Hood Burwell eloquently and ably propagated these notions, and one or two Presbyterian families or heads of families were pleased with the views he advanced and for a time joined the party. Mr. Ruggles Wright opposed these views and refused his hall for their propagation. Mr. Alonzo Wright did not join them, but fiercely opposed the mobs, sometimes led by his uncle, Mr. Andrew Leamy who handled them roughly.\"In 1874, William Pittman Lett, Ottawa's first City Clerk, in his epic poem \"Recollections of Bytown and Its Old Inhabitants\" writes:\"And Andrew Leamy in his time.Was head of many a stirring \"shine;\"A man of mark he might be singled,In whom the good and bad commingled,In equal balance in such a way,That each in turn had its sway.He's gone! The grass grows o'er his head,The Muse deals gently with the dead.\"William Lett's poem makes reference to Leamy's participation in one event where Leamy participated in a brawl in 1837, when 21 yr.-old Andrew and others were charged with creating a disturbance at a lumbermen's meeting in Bytown. The meeting was disrupted by Catholics who were protesting the \"disrespect offered by the Protestants to a statue of the Virgin Mary\" in the procession of the day before. Once again, Leamy was thus involved in a conflict of a religious nature, a disturbance cited by Dr. Michael S. Cross, historian, as an example of how the many disturbances during the Shiners' War not only had little to do with logging, but may also have had nothing to do with the Shiners (One disputed allegation recorded in the testimony of the case indicates that the men were associated with Peter Aylen). Andrew was only accused of breaking a window to enter the room and was acquitted of the charge of creating a disturbance.Proceedings of Police Magistrates, Bytown, January 12 and 13, 1837, AO MacKenxie-Lindsey Papers, MU2366\n\nParagraph 10: The Rhein Fire managed to get the game's early sparks going as they had a nine-play, 46-yard drive that led to a 31-yard field goal by Manfred Burgsm\u00fcller. However, the Dragons would put up some real firepower, as Dragons quarterback Jon Kitna led a four-play, 80-yard drive that was capped off with a 13-yard run by running back Terry Wilburn. Then, more than halfway through the first quarter, as Rhein began a drive from deep in their own territory, quarterback T. J. Rubley threw an interception towards Dragons safety Carlos Brooks, who returned the ball 16 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the fireworks managed to start flying. Rubley would lead a seven-play, 39-yard drive and cap it off with a touchdown on a three-yard quarterback sneak. However, Kitna and the Dragons would respond with a four-play, 79-yard drive that concluded with a 66-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marco Martos. Then, a little later in the quarter, the Dragons would further increase their lead with a five-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a 40-yard pass to wide receiver Alfonzo Browning. However, the Rhein Fire refused to trail 28\u201310 at halftime. Near the end of the half, Rubley would lead a nine-play, 56-yard drive that concluded with him running the ball in for a touchdown on a one-yard quarterback sneak. In the third quarter, both sides had their defenses stiffen throughout most of the quarter. However, the Dragons would eventually get an eight-play, 90-yard drive working for them, as Terry Wilburn capped off the drive with a four-yard touchdown run. Trailing 35\u201317 heading into the fourth quarter, the Rhein Fire had to get some points quick and fast. Unfortunately for them, the only score that they could get in the final quarter was a 22-yard pass from Rubley to wide receiver Sean Foster. The Dragons then capped off their World Bowl title with a 34-yard field goal by Spanish kicker Jes\u00fas Angoy.\n\nParagraph 11: Virgin Media included Madge in their top ten favourite soap characters poll in 2007. Orange UK describe Madge's style as being \"slightly transsexual\" and they stated \"She was the gravel-voiced matriarch of Ramsay Street. When she was not busy fending off the advances of Lou Carpenter, ruling tomboy daughter Charlene with an iron grip or running the coffee shop, she was marrying Harold Bishop.\" In 2013, Rachael Misstear from Western Mail included Madge's death in her list of the \"10 tear-jerking soap opera exits\". She commented \"It was one of the most heartbreaking deaths in the Ozzie soap's history. When one half of the golden couple in Aussie soap-land died, it left an army of fans bereft. How would Harold Bishop go on without his beloved Madge?\" Madge was placed at number five on the Huffpost's \"35 greatest Neighbours characters of all time\" feature. Journalist Adam Beresford described her as a \"classic soap matriarch\" and quickly established herself as \"one of the audience\u2019s favourite characters.\" He added that her early infamy came from exasperated maternal cries of \"Charleeene!\" when shouting her daughter and her nightmarish \"hoarse wail\". Beresford assessed that Madge was \"representing generations of Aussie women whose toughness earned the respect of their menfolk, Madge was a forthright force of nature.\" In 2022, Kate Randall from Heat included Madge and Harold in the magazine's top ten Neighbours characters of all time feature. Randall profiled the duo stating \"love's old dream, these two were everything we adored about Neighbours.\" In a feature profiling the \"top 12 iconic Neighbours characters\", critic Sheena McGinley of the Irish Independent placed Madge and Harold as joint tenth place. Sam Strutt of The Guardian compiled a feature counting down the top ten most memorable moments from history of Neighbours. Strutt included Madge's death as the fourth most memorable. Anne-Marie O'Connor of New Ross Standard branded Madge a \"gruff voiced old vixen\". O'Connor found Madge's funeral so emotional that she stated \"pass the Kleenex and be prepared to blub your way through Neighbours this week.\"\n\nParagraph 12: The Punta dance is performed by a man and a woman who evolve separately in a circle formed by the spectators. They begin facing each other and the figure varies with the ingenuity of the dancers, but always represents the evolution of a courtship in which first the man pursues, and then the woman, while the other retreats; and ends only when one of them, from exhaustion or from lack of further initiative, admits defeat by retiring from the ring, to have his or her place immediately taken by another. Punta dance is a mimetic cock-and-hen mating dance with rapid movements of the buttocks, hips, and feet, while the upper torso remains motionless. Couples attempt to dance more stylistically and seductively, with better hip movements, than their competitors. As the evening progresses, the Punta became extremely \u201chot\u201d; while the spectators egged on their favorites with cries of: m\u00edgira-ba labu, \u201cdon't leave (off) under him!\u201d or: m\u00edgira-ba tabu, \u201cdon't leave (off) under her!\u201d which has the same effect as, \u201cdon't let him (or her) beat you!\u201d\n\nParagraph 13: During seasons one and two, the opening sequence begins with images of Balki and Larry wiping sideways from opposite sides of the screen to meet in the middle, with the series title superimposed on top.  Larry is shown saying good-bye to his family as he leaves his home in Wisconsin, and drives to Chicago in his old red Ford Mustang.  The sequence then shifts to Balki, who is shown making his own farewells on Mypos before being driven off on the back of a horsecart, sitting alongside a box mislabeled \"America or Burst\".  Balki is next seen on the tramp steamer as he sights the Statue of Liberty, then on a bus, presumably making his way to Chicago.  After a brief shot of Larry driving under a \"Welcome to Chicago\" sign (in reality, located on eastbound Interstate 190 leading out of O'Hare International Airport), the sequence ends with the same shot of Balki and Larry together that began the sequence.  The first season featured a script font for the series title and credits.  For the second season, the show's title appears more similar to later seasons, and the script font is replaced with the fonts similar to that used in the remaining seasons.  The Lake Shore Drive footage is now shown correctly.  Additionally, the Larry and Balki sequences are shortened so that brief clips from some of the early episodes could be shown.\n\nParagraph 14: Before the existence of a formal police department, the first night watch was established in Boston in 1635. In 1703, pay in the sum of 35 shillings a month was set for members of the night watch. In 1796, the watch was reorganized, and the watchmen carried a badge of office, a rattle, and a six-foot pole, which was painted blue and white with a hook on one end and a bill on the other. The hook was used to grab fleeing criminals, and the rounded \"bill\" was used as a weapon. The rattle was a noise-making device used for calling for assistance.\n\nParagraph 15: The band have stated that Oliver was only added to the band so he could go on tour with them as a photographer, for they were impressed by his work. The band asked their management if they could bring Oliver on tour with them in 2000. They were told they could not afford to take someone who was not part of the band or their crew with them, so Oliver bought a set of turntables and quickly learnt what he needed to play. It is unclear how this occurrence coincides with ex-turntablist DJ Stepzak's departure from the band. As the band themselves worked on the remastered The Fake Sound of Progress, it can be assumed that the notably larger changes in the turntable and sample parts (recorded by Stepzak) compared to the other instruments is due to Oliver's influence on the record.\n\nParagraph 16: One week before the start of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, he finished second in the World Sprint Championships, behind a supreme Dan Jansen. This made Jansen the favourite for both the 500 and the 1,000\u00a0m. But because of a family tragedy (his sister died from leukemia just hours before the start of the 500\u00a0m), Jansen turned out to be mentally incapable of sprinting a perfect race; on both distances, Jansen fell. But it still remains doubtful if Jansen would have been able to beat Mey that day; the East German raced perfectly, faster than anyone had ever raced before. His opening time on the first 100\u00a0m of the 500\u00a0m was 9.76 and he finished in a new world record time of 36.45, a legendary record that would stand firm for four years.\n\nParagraph 17: Kim completed a BSc(Hons) in 1987 and PhD in 1990 at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, followed by postdoctoral research at the Australian National University. From 1991 to 2001 Kim worked as a lecturer and senior lecturer in at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, where he developed teaching and research interests in environmental chemistry, analytical chemistry and forensic science. It was during this period that Kim started creating science cartoons, which were initially published on Usenet and subsequently developed to an online archive hosted at Ohio State University, and (in print form) New Zealand Science Monthly.  In the subsequent decade from 2002 to 2011 Kim worked as a scientist at the Waikato Regional Council, a local government region of the upper North Island of New Zealand, specialising in scientific and regulatory aspects of environmental contamination issues, including development of local and national policy documents. In 2012 he returned to an academic position as a senior lecturer in applied environmental chemistry at Massey University in Wellington, where he has remained since. Kim teaches chemistry, toxicology, and environmental monitoring, and coordinates Massey University's undergraduate teaching programme in Environmental Health.  Kim is contributing editor of the Annals of Improbable Research.\n\nParagraph 18: Channel 9 signed on the air on October 11, 1949, as WOR-TV. It was owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service (a division of R.H. Macy and Company and named after the Bamberger's department store chain), which also operated WOR (710 AM) and WOR-FM (98.7 FM, now WEPN-FM). Exactly ten months earlier, Bamberger launched Washington, D.C.'s fourth television station, WOIC (now WUSA), also on channel 9. WOR-TV entered the New York market as the last of the city's VHF stations to sign on, and one of three independents\u2014the others being WPIX (channel 11) and Newark, New Jersey-based WATV (channel 13). On WOR-TV's opening night, a welcome address was read by WOR radio's morning host, John B. Gambling. However, the audio portion of the speech was not heard because of a technical glitch. The problem was fixed and Gambling repeated the message later that evening, prior to the station's sign-off.\n\nParagraph 19: As a testament to its Scottish heritage, the school has a very well known pipe band: The Scots College Pipes and Drums, established in 1900. The original band consisted of five members \u2013 boys who had joined the cadets as pipers. There are now over 230 boys in the band, making it the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1931 the band was granted permission to wear the tartan of the Black Watch regiment. The band's royal patron was formerly the Queen Mother. Traditionally, the Scots Pipes and Drums leads the annual ANZAC Day parade through Sydney. At the 2006 Australian Pipe band Championships, the Drum Corps won the Juvenile Drum Corp title, and the band as a whole earned a respectable third place. These results were then followed up by a successful run at the 2008 Australian Pipe Band Championships, where the band won both the Juvenile and Grade 4 title. These are the best results the band has seen in its long and prosperous history. The Pipes and Drums was recently invited and participated in the 2012 Queen's Diamond Jubilee Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the 2014 Basel Tattoo and went back to Edinburgh in 2016 to participate again in the Royal Edinburgh Tattoo\n\nParagraph 20:  Albert Edward Crook CBE, Principal Inspector of Mechanical Engineering, Mines Inspectorate, Ministry of Power. Albert E Crook was born in Hindley Lancashire in 1901, and educated at the Hindley Abram Grammar School and the Wigan and District Mining and Technical College where he studied mechanical and electrical engineering. Before the coal mines were nationalised he had 28 years experience in the industry as an engineering apprentice, draughtsman, engineer and assistant chief engineer; firstly with the Pearson Knowles Coal and Iron Company Ltd, and then with the Wigan Coal Corporation Ltd, which controlled many collieries in Lancashire, North Wales and Nottinghamshire. In 1944 Mr Crook became the first inspector of Mechanical Engineering in Mines  - A post recommended by the Royal Commission on safety in  Coal Mines 1938.He developed the mechanical engineering section of the Mies inspectorate and was actively associated with the application of locomotive transport, friction winding apparatus, precautions against overwinding and alloy steel suspension gear for cages. He was concerned with the engineering aspects of many mining regulations, including the Code of Mining Regulations issued by the International Labour office in 1950, the Mines and Quarry Act 1954, and he made the official report on the overwinding incident which occurred  at Brookhouse Colliery in 1958. In that year he became chief engineer 9 Production ) to the National Coal Boar. he was Director of Engineering to the Board from 1962 to 1966, when he retired. Albert E Crook was also involved in the Eassington Pit disaster investigation 1951. Mr Crook is the author of many technical papers to professional societies in this country and abroad, including the National Safety Congress of America. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Midlands Counties Institute of Engineers 1947 for his paper on \" Precautions Against Overwinding\"and the Gold Medal of the A.M.E.M.E in 1950 for his paper on \" Some fundamentals of Underground Haulage By Locomotives\" In 1960 the Institution of Mining Engineers awarded him the Douglas Hay Medal and Certificate in recognition of his valuable contributions to engineering practice in mining with special reference to haulage and winding , and for his papers on these subjects in the Transactions of the Institution. Mr Crook CBE was a Chartered Engineer, a fellow of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, a fellow of the Institution of Mining Engineers and a Fellow of the Association since 1926. He was National president of the Association 1960 -1961 a Vice - President from 1958 - 1960. Convenor of the Membership Committee and he was a member of the examination Board for many years. he was a  member of the Training and Education Committee and President of the North Western Branch in 1940 - 1941 when he proposed that the Institutions title should be altered to its present form. Me Crook was appointed a Commander of the British Empire CBE in 1958. He was chairman of the Colliery Requisites Industry Standards Committee from 1962 - 1967 and was President of the Southern Counties Institute of Mining Engineers for the season 1965 - 196. Since 1966 he was Chairman of the City and Guilds of London Coal Mining Education Advisory Committee, and from 1967 Chairman of the Mining and Quarrying Industry Standards Committee.\n\nParagraph 21: For those that are determined to be medically cleared for surgery, the anatomical location and size of the perforation must be determined. This is often done with a combination of a CT scan of the sinuses without contrast and an endoscopic evaluation by an Ear Nose and Throat doctor. Once dimensions are obtained the surgeon will decide if it is possible to close the perforation. Multiple approaches to access the septum have been described in the literature. While sublabial and midfacial degloving approaches have been described, the most popular today is the rhinoplasty approach. This can include both open and closed methods. The open method results in a scar on the columella, however, it allows for more visibility to the surgeon. The closed method utilizes an incision all on the inside of the nose. The concept behind closure includes bringing together the edges of mucosa on each side of the perforation with minimal tension. An interposition graft is also often used. The interposition graft provides extended stability and also structure to the area of the perforation. Classically, a graft from the scalp utilizing temporalis fascia was used. Kridel, et al., first described the usage of acellular dermis so that no further incisions are required; they reported an excellent closure rate of over 90 percent. Overall perforation closure rates are variable and often determined by the skill of the surgeon and technique used. Often surgeons who claim a high rate of closure choose perforations that are easier to close. An open rhinoplasty approach also allows for better access to the nose to repair any concurrent nasal deformities, such as saddle nose deformity, that occur with a septal perforation.\n\nParagraph 22: SR\u00a0128 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 50 (US\u00a050), in Cleves, on the west bank of the Great Miami River. The highway heads north as a two-lane highway passing through woodland and parallel to the river. The road curves northeast, before curving southeast, passing through commercial properties. The route curves northeast and has an interchange with Interstate 74 (I\u201374) and I\u2013275. North of the interchange SR\u00a0128 curves due north passing through Miamitown. The highway curves northwest before leaving the town. The route heads northwest passing through a mix of farmland and woodland. The roadway enters Ross and begins a concurrency with SR\u00a0126. The concurrency passes through residential properties, with some commercial properties.\n\nParagraph 23: He was sent by the Russian government in 1735 to assist in the Orenburg expedition in the rank of a sea captain. During this mission he was sent to explore Lake Aral, but was hindered by the Tartars from reaching the lake. He then employed himself in surveying the south-eastern frontier of Russia, particularly part of the basins of the Kama, Volga, and Jaik. Returning to St. Petersburg in January 1738, he took umbrage at not obtaining promotion and quit the Russian service. In the same year he proposed to some of the British factors at St. Petersburg to carry on a trade through Russia into Iran and central Asia by way of the Caspian Sea. Associating himself with Mungo Graeme, a young Scot, he obtained credit for a small cargo of goods suitable for Khiva and Bokhara. They left Moscow on 19 March 1738-9, and, proceeding down the Volga from Nijni Novgorod to Astrakhan, embarked on the Caspian for Karagansk. At Karagansk they received such unpromising accounts of the state of the steppe that they resolved to continue their voyage to Rasht in Iran. Elton was successful in finding a good market and in obtaining a decree from the shah granting them liberty to trade throughout Iran, and extraordinary privileges. He persuaded the Russia Company to take up his scheme, and in 1741 an Act of Parliament sanctioning the trade was passed. In 1742 two ships were built on the Caspian, and Elton was placed in command of the first completed. These vessels carried the English flag, which, however, Anthony Jenkinson claimed to have first displayed on the Caspian about 1558. The apprehensions of the Russian court were, however, excited by the intelligence that Elton was building ships on the Caspian, after the European fashion, for the Iranian sovereign, Nader Shah. On receipt of the intelligence the Russia Company despatched Jonas Hanway to make inquiry concerning Elton's proceedings. Hanway arrived at Rasht on 3 December 1743 and found Elton earnestly pressing forward the construction of Iranian vessels. The Russian court, indignant at Elton's action, refused to countenance the Caspian trade and ruined the expectations of the Russia Company.\n\nParagraph 24: His short story \"Natasha\", which originally appeared in Harper's, was included in the Best American Short Stories 2005 collection. His short story \"The Train of Their Departure\", which The New Yorker featured in its August 2010 issue, is actually an excerpt from his first novel The Free World, released on April 4, 2011, to wide acclaim. His short stories \"Tapka\" and \"The Russian Riviera\" were also published in The New Yorker.  His short stories \"The Second Strongest Man\" and \"A New Gravestone for an Old Grave\" have been published in Zoetrope All-Story. \"A New Gravestone for an Old Grave\" was also included in the Best American Short Stories 2006 collection.\n\nParagraph 25: Gottlieb was born in Drohobycz (then in Galicia in Austrian Poland, now in western Ukraine) to a wealthy, Yiddish and Polish-speaking Orthodox Jewish family. He was one of eleven children born to Fanya (n\u00e9e Tigerman) and Isaac Gottlieb. He was introduced to painting in Lemberg by Micha\u0142 Godlewski. At fifteen, he enrolled at the Vienna Fine Arts Academy for three years. In 1873 he went to Krak\u00f3w to study under Jan Matejko and became close friends with Jacek Malczewski. However, an anti-Semitic incident at the School of Fine Arts prompted him to leave Krak\u00f3w after less than a year in spite of Malczewski's protests. He traveled to Norway and stayed in Molde. He returned to Vienna and from there travelled to Munich in 1875 to study under Karl von Piloty and Alexander von Wagner. In 1876 he won the Gold Medal at the Munich Academy for his painting, Shylock and Jessica. In the same year, he moved back to Vienna to attend the workshop of Heinrich von Angeli. He lived and worked in Vienna for the next two years and produced paintings with biblical themes, as well as illustrations for Friedrich Bruckmann Publishing of Munich.\n\nParagraph 26: The name Lom Palanka was mentioned for the first time in 1704. The settlement then called Palanka stood between village and town in size and importance. In 1798 Lom suffered from brigand raids. With the development of shipping along the Danube after 1830, the importance of the town grew. The road to Sofia contributed to its progress and turned it into a main export port to Vienna (Austria). By 1869 there were 120 shops, 148 trade offices, 175 food shops, 34 coffee bars, six hotels and two mills. The town was centred on the old Kale (fortress), which was entered through three kapii (gates)\u00a0\u2014 Vidinska, Belogradchishka, Sofiyska. The tradesmen from Lom offered goods at the biggest fairs in the region and beyond. In 1880 there were 7,500 inhabitants in the town.\n\nParagraph 27: After starting a band with his children, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. became the group's manager and began promoting it. The group recorded an album with Freddie Records in 1984, though it was never released. Abraham provided two demos to Charlie Grever, father of Bob Grever owner of Cara Records, who signed then-thirteen year old Selena to the recording label. Manny Guerra, who separated from Cara Records, started his own record label. Guerra wanted to sign Selena to his recording label in 1985. Guerra dissolved the agreement between Cara Records and Selena when it was brought to his attention. Selena recorded five LP records for Manny's GP Productions by 1988, without a contract. Abraham expressed in an interview how he forgot to sign it, and noticed how Guerra stopped asking him about the contract after Selena became more popular. At the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, Selena was approached by Rick Trevino to be the opening act after La Sombra declined the offer. Jose Behar of newly formed EMI Latin and the heads of Sony Music attended the awards ceremony and were scouting for new acts. Behar wanted to sign Selena to his label, while Sony Music was offering twice EMI's offer. Behar believed he had discovered \"the next Gloria Estefan\", which his superior called him illogical since he had only been in Texas for a week. Abraham chose EMI Latin's offer because of the potential for a crossover, and he wanted his children to be the first musicians to sign with the company. Before Selena began recording her debut album, Behar and Stephen Finfer requested a crossover album for her. The singer recorded three English-language songs for the heads of EMI's pop division. Behar and Finfer's request for a crossover album was denied and Selena was told she needed a bigger fan base to sell such an album. Behar thought EMI Records and the public did not believe that a Mexican-American woman could have \"crossover potential\" after Charles Koppelman denied the project. The company believed Selena had potential in Mexico and South American markets when they signed the singer in 1989.\n\nParagraph 28: In response to Turin's 2013 paper, involving deuterated and undeuterated isotopomers of the musk cyclopentadecanone, Block et al. in a 2015 paper in PNAS report that the human musk-recognizing receptor, OR5AN1, identified using a heterologous olfactory receptor expression system and robustly responding to cyclopentadecanone and muscone (which has 30 hydrogens), fails to distinguish isotopomers of these compounds in vitro. Furthermore, the mouse (methylthio)methanethiol-recognizing receptor, MOR244-3, as well as other selected human and mouse olfactory receptors, responded similarly to normal, deuterated, and carbon-13 isotopomers of their respective ligands, paralleling results found with the musk receptor OR5AN1. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the proposed vibration theory of olfaction does not apply to the human musk receptor OR5AN1, mouse thiol receptor MOR244-3, or other olfactory receptors examined. Additionally, theoretical analysis by the authors shows that the proposed electron transfer mechanism of the vibrational frequencies of odorants could be easily suppressed by quantum effects of nonodorant molecular vibrational modes. The authors conclude: \"These and other concerns about electron transfer at olfactory receptors, together with our extensive experimental data, argue against the plausibility of the vibration theory.\" In commenting on this work, Vosshall writes \"In PNAS, Block et al\u2026. shift the \"shape vs. vibration\" debate from olfactory psychophysics to the biophysics of the ORs themselves. The authors mount a sophisticated multidisciplinary attack on the central tenets of the vibration theory using synthetic organic chemistry, heterologous expression of olfactory receptors, and theoretical considerations to find no evidence to support the vibration theory of smell.\" While Turin comments that Block used \"cells in a dish rather than within whole organisms\" and that \"expressing an olfactory receptor in human embryonic kidney cells doesn't adequately reconstitute the complex nature of olfaction...\", Vosshall responds \"Embryonic kidney cells are not identical to the cells in the nose .. but if you are looking at receptors, it's the best system in the world.\" In a Letter to the Editor of PNAS, Turin et al. raise concerns about Block et al. and Block et al. respond. A recent study describes the responses of primary olfactory neurons in tissue culture to isotopes and finds that a small fraction of the population (<1%) clearly discriminates between isotopes, some even giving an all-or-or -none response to H or D isotopomers of octanal. The authors attribute this to \"hypersensitivity\" of some receptors to differences in hydrophobicity between normal and deuterated odorants.\n\nParagraph 29: In his 2011 book That Is All, John Hodgman titles a chapter about taking a cruise \"A Totally Fun Thing I Would Do Again as Soon as Possible\". The name of the 2012 Simpsons episode \"A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again\" also references the title essay. Tina Fey's 2011 memoir Bossypants includes a chapter on her own cruise experience, titled \"My Honeymoon: Or, A Supposedly Fun Thing That I'll Never Do Again Either\", in which she jokingly suggests that those who've heard of Wallace's book should consider themselves members of the \"cultural elite.\" In Charlie Kaufman's 2020 film I'm Thinking of Ending Things, the character Jake mentions the book, refers to E Unibus Pluram, then recites a portion of the essay from the section \"Image-Fiction\" verbatim.\n\nParagraph 30: The embodiment of the Gopher mascot came to life in 1952 when University of Minnesota assistant bandmaster Jerome Glass bought a fuzzy wool gopher suit with a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head and asked one of the band members to climb into it.  \"Goldy\" Gopher (the first name seems to have appeared sometime in the 1960s) became a fixture within the University of Minnesota Marching Band and Pep Band, as each year a band member was chosen to don the suit for that season. Wherever these two bands performed, Goldy was there to glad-hand with the crowd, hug the little kids, torment the cheerleaders and generally add a friendly Minnesota flavor to the event.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe Gopher mascot, named \"Goldy,\" originated in 1952 when a University of Minnesota band member wore a wool gopher suit with a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head. The mascot, known as Goldy, became a regular part of the university's Marching Band and Pep Band, with a different band member chosen each year to wear the suit. Goldy attended various events, interacting with the crowd and adding a friendly Minnesota touch to the atmosphere. The first name, Goldy, appeared in the 1960s.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from. The answer format must be like \"Paragraph 1\", \"Paragraph 2\", etc.\n\nThe answer is: ", "input": "The Gopher mascot, named \"Goldy,\" originated in 1952 when a University of Minnesota band member wore a wool gopher suit with a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head.

The total length of the causeway and the via is around . The Lake Causeway was designed to allow the rapid movement of goods and people between the city and the lake, and easy access to water. The Lake Causeway probably developed from a Middle Preclassic pathway that ran between the shore and the early settlement. The earliest version of the Lake Causeway was built in the Late Preclassic; it was about  wide and was raised  above natural ground level. The Via 5 continuation did not exist in the Late Preclassic, when the later city centre had not yet developed. During the Late Classic the causeway was further developed and extended with the formal construction of Via 5 running across the site core. The point where the two met was deliberately narrowed with the construction of flanking buildings and is likely to have been a guardpost where access to the site core was controlled. It is likely that travellers and goods arriving at the city were inspected and taxed at this control point. At its narrowest point the entrance from the causeway to Via 5 was just  wide. Parapets were erected flanking the Lake Causeway; they stood approximately  high and varied from  wide. The southern extreme of the causeway was modified with the construction of a stucco-covered platform with masonry walls defining the east and south sides. From the southern end of the causeway to the union with Via 5 there is an approximate difference in altitude of more than . There is some evidence that steps were carved from the limestone bedrock where the southern platform met the Lake Causeway. During a second phase of construction in the Late Classic, the southern platform was enlarged to measure  east-west by  north-south. The platform was supported on the south and east sides by refurbished talud walls coated in stucco. The causeway itself was redesigned as a long ramp that joined the southern platform with the city centre and the junction with Via 5. In the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800\u2013900) the southern end of the Lake Causeway was re-dressed with limestone fill. The stepped sides of the southern platform were filled in and covered with stone to form ramps. At about this time Stela A, a plain monument, was erected on the platform. Also in the Terminal Classic the restrictions at the north end of the causeway where it met Via 5 were removed; the whole area was levelled with finely dressed stone and mortar that left the access free for the entire width of the causeway. Ceramic remains recovered from the Lake Causeway are scarce and poorly preserved due to the strong waterflow along the incline caused during the rain season, resulting in artefacts being eroded and washed downhill towards the lake.\n\nParagraph 2: Mordashov is the son of Russian parents, who were both steel mill workers. According to Mordashov, his family used welfare coupons, allowed only 200g of butter and 400g of sausages per month. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Leningrad Engineering-Economical Institute, currently known as ENGECON. He later gained an MBA from Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in 2001. In an address to students at the European University at Saint Petersburg, Mordashov spoke about his decision to study in Leningrad rather than Moscow and the value his undergraduate studies played in his search for employment and eventual career path. Returning to Cherepovets, he started his career by joining the same steel plant where his parents had worked.\n\nParagraph 3: Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the University of Cambridge with honours in Mathematics (equal Third Wrangler), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had. She saved enough money to buy into the business with her sister, and she now owns (with Sir George) a chain of brothels across Europe. Vivie is, at first, horrified by the revelation, but then lauds her mother as a champion. However, the reconciliation ends when Vivie finds out that her mother continues to run the business even though she no longer needs to. Vivie takes an office job in the city and dumps Frank, vowing she will never marry. She disowns her mother, and Mrs. Warren is left heartbroken, having looked forward to growing old with her daughter.\n\nParagraph 4: Ayres Borghi-Zerni was born in Buenos Aires in 1895 to a musical family. Her father was Edgardo Zerni, an Italian operatic tenor of modest reputation, and her aunt was Adele Borghi, a prominent mezzo-soprano admired by Giuseppe Verdi himself. Little is known about Ayres's early years. She studied singing in Milan under a teacher called Bonanno and made her debut in 1914 at the Teatro dal Verme as Micaela in Georges Bizet's Carmen. In the next two years she made a number of successful appearances on Italian provincial stages, amongst which was the Teatro della Pergola in Florence where in 1916 she appeared as Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto. In 1917 Ayres Borghi-Zerni toured South America, where she sang Lucia di Lammermoor in Gaetano Donizetti's opera of the same title and Violetta in Verdi's La traviata at the Gran Teatro de La Habana, National Theatre of Venezuela and the Teatro Arbeu in Mexico. The following year Ayres Borghi-Zerni made her first appearance at an important Italian opera house - Teatro Comunale di Bologna, where she performed Gilda in Rigoletto and Amina in Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula. This signed the beginning of her important career: in the following ten years (1918-1928) Borghi-Zerni was invited to sing at the most prominent theatres of Italy, amongst which were the Teatro Costanzi in Rome (in 1918 and 1922), the Teatro Massimo in Palermo (in 1919), the Teatro San Carlo in Naples (in 1919, 1920, 1924, 1925 and 1928), the Teatro La Fenice in Venice (in 1921, 1926 and 1927) and the Teatro Regio in Turin (in 1922). It seems quite strange, though, that she never appeared at the Teatro alla Scala. Apart from the greatest Italian stages, Borghi-Zerni was tremendously successful in at The Royal Opera House in London, where in 1919 she sang Violetta in La traviata. She also made guest appearances at the Teatro Liceo in Barcelona (also in 1919, in Gioacchino Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Lucia di Lammermoor and  Rigoletto) and the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo (in 1920, in La traviata, Rigoletto (as a partner of the great tenor Beniamino Gigli) and the world premiere of Raoul Gunsbourg's new opera Satan). Ayres Borghi-Zerni's career did not last long, as she seems to have retired from the stage in 1928. She gave her last performances as Violetta and Lucia in 1928 (at the Teatro San Carlo and Politeama Reinach in Parma), and after this point her life is unknown.\n\nParagraph 5: The Dodgers began the month of June where they left off in May, losing their fifth straight game. This time they committed four errors and were pounded by the Colorado Rockies 13\u20133 at Coors Field. In that game, the Dodgers set a Major League record by having five sons of former Major Leaguers in the lineup at the same time (Tony Gwynn Jr., Jerry Hairston Jr., Iv\u00e1n DeJes\u00fas Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. The losing streak came to an end the next day, when they got a strong pitching performance from Aaron Harang and some timely hitting, including Bobby Abreu's first homer as a Dodger, in a 6\u20132 win. However, the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation the next day as they dropped the series finale to the Rockies 3\u20132. The Dodgers road trip continued on June 4 as they traveled to Citizens Bank Park to open a four-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Dee Gordon hit a triple to lead off the ninth against Phillies closer Jonathan Papelbon and then scored on a single by Eli\u00e1n Herrera to give the Dodgers the winning margin in the 4\u20133 victory. Herrera came through the next night as well, hitting a two-RBI double off Cliff Lee in the top of the eighth to give the Dodgers the go-ahead run in a 2\u20131 victory over the Phillies. Dee Gordon delivered a two-run single during the Dodgers three-run sixth inning on June 6 as they again came from behind to beat the Phillies, this time by a score of 6\u20135. Kenley Jansen picked up his third save in three days against the Phillies. The Dodgers, helped by three Phillies errors, swept the series with an 8\u20133 victory in the series finale. The victory was the 100th career win for pitcher Aaron Harang and the team's first ever four-game series sweep in Philadelphia. The Dodgers continued the lengthy road trip with a cross-country flight to Seattle to take on the Mariners in interleague play. In the opener Nathan Eovaldi pitched six scoreless innings before the Mariners got a run off of relief pitcher Scott Elbert. It was all they needed because Kevin Millwood and five relief pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Dodgers. This was the first official no-hitter against the Dodgers since Kent Mercker of the Atlanta Braves had done it on April 4, 1994. The Dodgers got back into the winning ways the next day as Clayton Kershaw stuck out a season-high 12 batters in 7 innings and Jerry Hairston Jr. hit a home run and had 5 RBI in the 8\u20133 win. Andre Ethier hit his fourth career grand slam to back Chad Billingsley's strong effort as the Dodgers closed out the lengthy road trip with an 8\u20132 victory over the Mariners. Billingsley allowed only one run in 7 innings while striking out 8.\n\nParagraph 6: The original SMA correlator was designed to correlate 2 GHz of IF bandwidth per sideband from each of two active receivers in eight antennas, producing spectral data for 28 baselines.    Because the analog-to-digital converters sampled at 208 MHz, the IF was downconverted into 24 partially overlapping \"chunks\", each 104 MHz wide, before sampling.  After sampling, the data were sent to 90 large PC boards, each of which held 32 ASIC correlator chips.   The correlator was an XF design; in the default configuration 6144 lags were calculated for each of two receivers on 28 baselines, before an FFT was applied to convert the lag data to spectra.   In the default configuration the spectral resolution was 812.5 kHz per channel, but the correlator could be reconfigured to increase the spectral resolution on certain chunks, at the expense of lower resolution elsewhere in the spectrum.  The correlator chips were designed at MIT Haystack, and funded by five institutions: SMA, USNO, NASA, NRFA and JIVE.    The correlator could also be configured to correlate all 45 baselines produced by adding the CSO and JCMT to the array, but only for a single receiver per antenna.\n\nParagraph 7: Enric Valor was born in 1911,  the son of an affluent family from Castalla, in the Valencian comarca of l'Alcoi\u00e0. In 1930, at the age of nineteen, he became a journalist in Alicante writing in the satirical newspaper El Tio Cuc, in Valencian. During the Second Spanish Republic he started to become politically active. His main demand was for autonomous status for the Land of Valencia. He was also at this time working in the city of Valencia in the nationalist newspapers  La Rep\u00fablica de les Lletres, El Cam\u00ed and El Pa\u00eds Valenci\u00e0. When the Spanish Civil War broke out he supported the Spanish Republic.\n\nParagraph 8: On January 1, 1868, construction began on the first line connecting Denver and Golden. On January 14, the company changed its name to Colorado Central Railroad.  Construction of the first line was slow. By the end of the year, only the small portion (less than 12 miles) between Denver and Golden had been graded. In the meantime, former Territorial Governor John Evans (co-conspirator of the Sand Creek Massacre) and other business leaders from Denver City, including David Moffat, William Byers (Rocky Mountain News), Joseph E. Bates, Bela Hughes, Walter Cheesman (Denver Water) and Luther Kountze (Colorado National Bank), formed the Denver Pacific Railway on November 19, 1867, with the intention of building a rail line from Denver to Cheyenne. The formation of the Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company set off an intense struggle over the next two years between the two companies to complete their lines connecting to Union Pacific. By the following year, the success of the Denver Pacific investors in persuading the United States Congress to grant them land allowing them to construct a line throughout the South Platte River valley to Cheyenne made it evident that Denver would prevail over Golden. The Denver Pacific line was complete in June 1870 and the first train arrived in Denver from Cheyenne, bypassing Golden. Two months later, the Kansas Pacific completed its line to Denver, linking up with the Denver Pacific, and cementing the central role of Denver in Colorado.\n\nParagraph 9: \"It is told of him, as showing his strength and endurance, that when repairs were needed for the mill, that he would mount a horse and carry the part \u2013 often of heavy iron \u2013 to Montreal, get it mended and without stopping to rest, would ride back to Hull, making a journey of 240 miles through a wild country, under the most tiring conditions.\"\"I recently met an old resident of the Township, who remembered many of the pioneers. He was one of those rare beings who seemed to remember only the good qualities of the men he had known. \"Another kind hearted man\" said he \"was Andy Leamy. I've known him to be driving along the road with a load of supplies for his lumber camp, and passing the hovel of a family in need, throw off a barrel of flour and pass on as though he thought nothing of it. Andy didn't make much pretense of being a saint, but he did a whole lot of good all the same.\"John Lowrey Gourlay wrote this passage about an incident of a religious nature that occurred in 1835 in Wright's Town, when Leamy was 19 years-old:\"A man of fervor, (Reverend) Burwell, declared to his people from the pulpit, and in the parlor, shop and store, his newly-found views that struck most people with the force of all new ideas. His success in Hull seemed considerable, several influential people becoming obedient to the new faith. \u2026 Nevertheless the mob in Hull undertook to dictate to those who took up the new opinions, or at least to greatly disturb their meetings. \u2026 The late Andrew Leamy, a famous old warrior, took sometimes an active hand in these troubles. Often from sharp and angry words they went to blows, marking each others face's very picturesquely. ... Rev. Adam Hood Burwell eloquently and ably propagated these notions, and one or two Presbyterian families or heads of families were pleased with the views he advanced and for a time joined the party. Mr. Ruggles Wright opposed these views and refused his hall for their propagation. Mr. Alonzo Wright did not join them, but fiercely opposed the mobs, sometimes led by his uncle, Mr. Andrew Leamy who handled them roughly.\"In 1874, William Pittman Lett, Ottawa's first City Clerk, in his epic poem \"Recollections of Bytown and Its Old Inhabitants\" writes:\"And Andrew Leamy in his time.Was head of many a stirring \"shine;\"A man of mark he might be singled,In whom the good and bad commingled,In equal balance in such a way,That each in turn had its sway.He's gone! The grass grows o'er his head,The Muse deals gently with the dead.\"William Lett's poem makes reference to Leamy's participation in one event where Leamy participated in a brawl in 1837, when 21 yr.-old Andrew and others were charged with creating a disturbance at a lumbermen's meeting in Bytown. The meeting was disrupted by Catholics who were protesting the \"disrespect offered by the Protestants to a statue of the Virgin Mary\" in the procession of the day before. Once again, Leamy was thus involved in a conflict of a religious nature, a disturbance cited by Dr. Michael S. Cross, historian, as an example of how the many disturbances during the Shiners' War not only had little to do with logging, but may also have had nothing to do with the Shiners (One disputed allegation recorded in the testimony of the case indicates that the men were associated with Peter Aylen). Andrew was only accused of breaking a window to enter the room and was acquitted of the charge of creating a disturbance.Proceedings of Police Magistrates, Bytown, January 12 and 13, 1837, AO MacKenxie-Lindsey Papers, MU2366\n\nParagraph 10: The Rhein Fire managed to get the game's early sparks going as they had a nine-play, 46-yard drive that led to a 31-yard field goal by Manfred Burgsm\u00fcller. However, the Dragons would put up some real firepower, as Dragons quarterback Jon Kitna led a four-play, 80-yard drive that was capped off with a 13-yard run by running back Terry Wilburn. Then, more than halfway through the first quarter, as Rhein began a drive from deep in their own territory, quarterback T. J. Rubley threw an interception towards Dragons safety Carlos Brooks, who returned the ball 16 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the fireworks managed to start flying. Rubley would lead a seven-play, 39-yard drive and cap it off with a touchdown on a three-yard quarterback sneak. However, Kitna and the Dragons would respond with a four-play, 79-yard drive that concluded with a 66-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marco Martos. Then, a little later in the quarter, the Dragons would further increase their lead with a five-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a 40-yard pass to wide receiver Alfonzo Browning. However, the Rhein Fire refused to trail 28\u201310 at halftime. Near the end of the half, Rubley would lead a nine-play, 56-yard drive that concluded with him running the ball in for a touchdown on a one-yard quarterback sneak. In the third quarter, both sides had their defenses stiffen throughout most of the quarter. However, the Dragons would eventually get an eight-play, 90-yard drive working for them, as Terry Wilburn capped off the drive with a four-yard touchdown run. Trailing 35\u201317 heading into the fourth quarter, the Rhein Fire had to get some points quick and fast. Unfortunately for them, the only score that they could get in the final quarter was a 22-yard pass from Rubley to wide receiver Sean Foster. The Dragons then capped off their World Bowl title with a 34-yard field goal by Spanish kicker Jes\u00fas Angoy.\n\nParagraph 11: Virgin Media included Madge in their top ten favourite soap characters poll in 2007. Orange UK describe Madge's style as being \"slightly transsexual\" and they stated \"She was the gravel-voiced matriarch of Ramsay Street. When she was not busy fending off the advances of Lou Carpenter, ruling tomboy daughter Charlene with an iron grip or running the coffee shop, she was marrying Harold Bishop.\" In 2013, Rachael Misstear from Western Mail included Madge's death in her list of the \"10 tear-jerking soap opera exits\". She commented \"It was one of the most heartbreaking deaths in the Ozzie soap's history. When one half of the golden couple in Aussie soap-land died, it left an army of fans bereft. How would Harold Bishop go on without his beloved Madge?\" Madge was placed at number five on the Huffpost's \"35 greatest Neighbours characters of all time\" feature. Journalist Adam Beresford described her as a \"classic soap matriarch\" and quickly established herself as \"one of the audience\u2019s favourite characters.\" He added that her early infamy came from exasperated maternal cries of \"Charleeene!\" when shouting her daughter and her nightmarish \"hoarse wail\". Beresford assessed that Madge was \"representing generations of Aussie women whose toughness earned the respect of their menfolk, Madge was a forthright force of nature.\" In 2022, Kate Randall from Heat included Madge and Harold in the magazine's top ten Neighbours characters of all time feature. Randall profiled the duo stating \"love's old dream, these two were everything we adored about Neighbours.\" In a feature profiling the \"top 12 iconic Neighbours characters\", critic Sheena McGinley of the Irish Independent placed Madge and Harold as joint tenth place. Sam Strutt of The Guardian compiled a feature counting down the top ten most memorable moments from history of Neighbours. Strutt included Madge's death as the fourth most memorable. Anne-Marie O'Connor of New Ross Standard branded Madge a \"gruff voiced old vixen\". O'Connor found Madge's funeral so emotional that she stated \"pass the Kleenex and be prepared to blub your way through Neighbours this week.\"\n\nParagraph 12: The Punta dance is performed by a man and a woman who evolve separately in a circle formed by the spectators. They begin facing each other and the figure varies with the ingenuity of the dancers, but always represents the evolution of a courtship in which first the man pursues, and then the woman, while the other retreats; and ends only when one of them, from exhaustion or from lack of further initiative, admits defeat by retiring from the ring, to have his or her place immediately taken by another. Punta dance is a mimetic cock-and-hen mating dance with rapid movements of the buttocks, hips, and feet, while the upper torso remains motionless. Couples attempt to dance more stylistically and seductively, with better hip movements, than their competitors. As the evening progresses, the Punta became extremely \u201chot\u201d; while the spectators egged on their favorites with cries of: m\u00edgira-ba labu, \u201cdon't leave (off) under him!\u201d or: m\u00edgira-ba tabu, \u201cdon't leave (off) under her!\u201d which has the same effect as, \u201cdon't let him (or her) beat you!\u201d\n\nParagraph 13: During seasons one and two, the opening sequence begins with images of Balki and Larry wiping sideways from opposite sides of the screen to meet in the middle, with the series title superimposed on top.  Larry is shown saying good-bye to his family as he leaves his home in Wisconsin, and drives to Chicago in his old red Ford Mustang.  The sequence then shifts to Balki, who is shown making his own farewells on Mypos before being driven off on the back of a horsecart, sitting alongside a box mislabeled \"America or Burst\".  Balki is next seen on the tramp steamer as he sights the Statue of Liberty, then on a bus, presumably making his way to Chicago.  After a brief shot of Larry driving under a \"Welcome to Chicago\" sign (in reality, located on eastbound Interstate 190 leading out of O'Hare International Airport), the sequence ends with the same shot of Balki and Larry together that began the sequence.  The first season featured a script font for the series title and credits.  For the second season, the show's title appears more similar to later seasons, and the script font is replaced with the fonts similar to that used in the remaining seasons.  The Lake Shore Drive footage is now shown correctly.  Additionally, the Larry and Balki sequences are shortened so that brief clips from some of the early episodes could be shown.\n\nParagraph 14: Before the existence of a formal police department, the first night watch was established in Boston in 1635. In 1703, pay in the sum of 35 shillings a month was set for members of the night watch. In 1796, the watch was reorganized, and the watchmen carried a badge of office, a rattle, and a six-foot pole, which was painted blue and white with a hook on one end and a bill on the other. The hook was used to grab fleeing criminals, and the rounded \"bill\" was used as a weapon. The rattle was a noise-making device used for calling for assistance.\n\nParagraph 15: The band have stated that Oliver was only added to the band so he could go on tour with them as a photographer, for they were impressed by his work. The band asked their management if they could bring Oliver on tour with them in 2000. They were told they could not afford to take someone who was not part of the band or their crew with them, so Oliver bought a set of turntables and quickly learnt what he needed to play. It is unclear how this occurrence coincides with ex-turntablist DJ Stepzak's departure from the band. As the band themselves worked on the remastered The Fake Sound of Progress, it can be assumed that the notably larger changes in the turntable and sample parts (recorded by Stepzak) compared to the other instruments is due to Oliver's influence on the record.\n\nParagraph 16: One week before the start of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, he finished second in the World Sprint Championships, behind a supreme Dan Jansen. This made Jansen the favourite for both the 500 and the 1,000\u00a0m. But because of a family tragedy (his sister died from leukemia just hours before the start of the 500\u00a0m), Jansen turned out to be mentally incapable of sprinting a perfect race; on both distances, Jansen fell. But it still remains doubtful if Jansen would have been able to beat Mey that day; the East German raced perfectly, faster than anyone had ever raced before. His opening time on the first 100\u00a0m of the 500\u00a0m was 9.76 and he finished in a new world record time of 36.45, a legendary record that would stand firm for four years.\n\nParagraph 17: Kim completed a BSc(Hons) in 1987 and PhD in 1990 at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, followed by postdoctoral research at the Australian National University. From 1991 to 2001 Kim worked as a lecturer and senior lecturer in at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, where he developed teaching and research interests in environmental chemistry, analytical chemistry and forensic science. It was during this period that Kim started creating science cartoons, which were initially published on Usenet and subsequently developed to an online archive hosted at Ohio State University, and (in print form) New Zealand Science Monthly.  In the subsequent decade from 2002 to 2011 Kim worked as a scientist at the Waikato Regional Council, a local government region of the upper North Island of New Zealand, specialising in scientific and regulatory aspects of environmental contamination issues, including development of local and national policy documents. In 2012 he returned to an academic position as a senior lecturer in applied environmental chemistry at Massey University in Wellington, where he has remained since. Kim teaches chemistry, toxicology, and environmental monitoring, and coordinates Massey University's undergraduate teaching programme in Environmental Health.  Kim is contributing editor of the Annals of Improbable Research.\n\nParagraph 18: Channel 9 signed on the air on October 11, 1949, as WOR-TV. It was owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service (a division of R.H. Macy and Company and named after the Bamberger's department store chain), which also operated WOR (710 AM) and WOR-FM (98.7 FM, now WEPN-FM). Exactly ten months earlier, Bamberger launched Washington, D.C.'s fourth television station, WOIC (now WUSA), also on channel 9. WOR-TV entered the New York market as the last of the city's VHF stations to sign on, and one of three independents\u2014the others being WPIX (channel 11) and Newark, New Jersey-based WATV (channel 13). On WOR-TV's opening night, a welcome address was read by WOR radio's morning host, John B. Gambling. However, the audio portion of the speech was not heard because of a technical glitch. The problem was fixed and Gambling repeated the message later that evening, prior to the station's sign-off.\n\nParagraph 19: As a testament to its Scottish heritage, the school has a very well known pipe band: The Scots College Pipes and Drums, established in 1900. The original band consisted of five members \u2013 boys who had joined the cadets as pipers. There are now over 230 boys in the band, making it the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1931 the band was granted permission to wear the tartan of the Black Watch regiment. The band's royal patron was formerly the Queen Mother. Traditionally, the Scots Pipes and Drums leads the annual ANZAC Day parade through Sydney. At the 2006 Australian Pipe band Championships, the Drum Corps won the Juvenile Drum Corp title, and the band as a whole earned a respectable third place. These results were then followed up by a successful run at the 2008 Australian Pipe Band Championships, where the band won both the Juvenile and Grade 4 title. These are the best results the band has seen in its long and prosperous history. The Pipes and Drums was recently invited and participated in the 2012 Queen's Diamond Jubilee Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the 2014 Basel Tattoo and went back to Edinburgh in 2016 to participate again in the Royal Edinburgh Tattoo\n\nParagraph 20:  Albert Edward Crook CBE, Principal Inspector of Mechanical Engineering, Mines Inspectorate, Ministry of Power. Albert E Crook was born in Hindley Lancashire in 1901, and educated at the Hindley Abram Grammar School and the Wigan and District Mining and Technical College where he studied mechanical and electrical engineering. Before the coal mines were nationalised he had 28 years experience in the industry as an engineering apprentice, draughtsman, engineer and assistant chief engineer; firstly with the Pearson Knowles Coal and Iron Company Ltd, and then with the Wigan Coal Corporation Ltd, which controlled many collieries in Lancashire, North Wales and Nottinghamshire. In 1944 Mr Crook became the first inspector of Mechanical Engineering in Mines  - A post recommended by the Royal Commission on safety in  Coal Mines 1938.He developed the mechanical engineering section of the Mies inspectorate and was actively associated with the application of locomotive transport, friction winding apparatus, precautions against overwinding and alloy steel suspension gear for cages. He was concerned with the engineering aspects of many mining regulations, including the Code of Mining Regulations issued by the International Labour office in 1950, the Mines and Quarry Act 1954, and he made the official report on the overwinding incident which occurred  at Brookhouse Colliery in 1958. In that year he became chief engineer 9 Production ) to the National Coal Boar. he was Director of Engineering to the Board from 1962 to 1966, when he retired. Albert E Crook was also involved in the Eassington Pit disaster investigation 1951. Mr Crook is the author of many technical papers to professional societies in this country and abroad, including the National Safety Congress of America. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Midlands Counties Institute of Engineers 1947 for his paper on \" Precautions Against Overwinding\"and the Gold Medal of the A.M.E.M.E in 1950 for his paper on \" Some fundamentals of Underground Haulage By Locomotives\" In 1960 the Institution of Mining Engineers awarded him the Douglas Hay Medal and Certificate in recognition of his valuable contributions to engineering practice in mining with special reference to haulage and winding , and for his papers on these subjects in the Transactions of the Institution. Mr Crook CBE was a Chartered Engineer, a fellow of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, a fellow of the Institution of Mining Engineers and a Fellow of the Association since 1926. He was National president of the Association 1960 -1961 a Vice - President from 1958 - 1960. Convenor of the Membership Committee and he was a member of the examination Board for many years. he was a  member of the Training and Education Committee and President of the North Western Branch in 1940 - 1941 when he proposed that the Institutions title should be altered to its present form. Me Crook was appointed a Commander of the British Empire CBE in 1958. He was chairman of the Colliery Requisites Industry Standards Committee from 1962 - 1967 and was President of the Southern Counties Institute of Mining Engineers for the season 1965 - 196. Since 1966 he was Chairman of the City and Guilds of London Coal Mining Education Advisory Committee, and from 1967 Chairman of the Mining and Quarrying Industry Standards Committee.\n\nParagraph 21: For those that are determined to be medically cleared for surgery, the anatomical location and size of the perforation must be determined. This is often done with a combination of a CT scan of the sinuses without contrast and an endoscopic evaluation by an Ear Nose and Throat doctor. Once dimensions are obtained the surgeon will decide if it is possible to close the perforation. Multiple approaches to access the septum have been described in the literature. While sublabial and midfacial degloving approaches have been described, the most popular today is the rhinoplasty approach. This can include both open and closed methods. The open method results in a scar on the columella, however, it allows for more visibility to the surgeon. The closed method utilizes an incision all on the inside of the nose. The concept behind closure includes bringing together the edges of mucosa on each side of the perforation with minimal tension. An interposition graft is also often used. The interposition graft provides extended stability and also structure to the area of the perforation. Classically, a graft from the scalp utilizing temporalis fascia was used. Kridel, et al., first described the usage of acellular dermis so that no further incisions are required; they reported an excellent closure rate of over 90 percent. Overall perforation closure rates are variable and often determined by the skill of the surgeon and technique used. Often surgeons who claim a high rate of closure choose perforations that are easier to close. An open rhinoplasty approach also allows for better access to the nose to repair any concurrent nasal deformities, such as saddle nose deformity, that occur with a septal perforation.\n\nParagraph 22: SR\u00a0128 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 50 (US\u00a050), in Cleves, on the west bank of the Great Miami River. The highway heads north as a two-lane highway passing through woodland and parallel to the river. The road curves northeast, before curving southeast, passing through commercial properties. The route curves northeast and has an interchange with Interstate 74 (I\u201374) and I\u2013275. North of the interchange SR\u00a0128 curves due north passing through Miamitown. The highway curves northwest before leaving the town. The route heads northwest passing through a mix of farmland and woodland. The roadway enters Ross and begins a concurrency with SR\u00a0126. The concurrency passes through residential properties, with some commercial properties.\n\nParagraph 23: He was sent by the Russian government in 1735 to assist in the Orenburg expedition in the rank of a sea captain. During this mission he was sent to explore Lake Aral, but was hindered by the Tartars from reaching the lake. He then employed himself in surveying the south-eastern frontier of Russia, particularly part of the basins of the Kama, Volga, and Jaik. Returning to St. Petersburg in January 1738, he took umbrage at not obtaining promotion and quit the Russian service. In the same year he proposed to some of the British factors at St. Petersburg to carry on a trade through Russia into Iran and central Asia by way of the Caspian Sea. Associating himself with Mungo Graeme, a young Scot, he obtained credit for a small cargo of goods suitable for Khiva and Bokhara. They left Moscow on 19 March 1738-9, and, proceeding down the Volga from Nijni Novgorod to Astrakhan, embarked on the Caspian for Karagansk. At Karagansk they received such unpromising accounts of the state of the steppe that they resolved to continue their voyage to Rasht in Iran. Elton was successful in finding a good market and in obtaining a decree from the shah granting them liberty to trade throughout Iran, and extraordinary privileges. He persuaded the Russia Company to take up his scheme, and in 1741 an Act of Parliament sanctioning the trade was passed. In 1742 two ships were built on the Caspian, and Elton was placed in command of the first completed. These vessels carried the English flag, which, however, Anthony Jenkinson claimed to have first displayed on the Caspian about 1558. The apprehensions of the Russian court were, however, excited by the intelligence that Elton was building ships on the Caspian, after the European fashion, for the Iranian sovereign, Nader Shah. On receipt of the intelligence the Russia Company despatched Jonas Hanway to make inquiry concerning Elton's proceedings. Hanway arrived at Rasht on 3 December 1743 and found Elton earnestly pressing forward the construction of Iranian vessels. The Russian court, indignant at Elton's action, refused to countenance the Caspian trade and ruined the expectations of the Russia Company.\n\nParagraph 24: His short story \"Natasha\", which originally appeared in Harper's, was included in the Best American Short Stories 2005 collection. His short story \"The Train of Their Departure\", which The New Yorker featured in its August 2010 issue, is actually an excerpt from his first novel The Free World, released on April 4, 2011, to wide acclaim. His short stories \"Tapka\" and \"The Russian Riviera\" were also published in The New Yorker.  His short stories \"The Second Strongest Man\" and \"A New Gravestone for an Old Grave\" have been published in Zoetrope All-Story. \"A New Gravestone for an Old Grave\" was also included in the Best American Short Stories 2006 collection.\n\nParagraph 25: Gottlieb was born in Drohobycz (then in Galicia in Austrian Poland, now in western Ukraine) to a wealthy, Yiddish and Polish-speaking Orthodox Jewish family. He was one of eleven children born to Fanya (n\u00e9e Tigerman) and Isaac Gottlieb. He was introduced to painting in Lemberg by Micha\u0142 Godlewski. At fifteen, he enrolled at the Vienna Fine Arts Academy for three years. In 1873 he went to Krak\u00f3w to study under Jan Matejko and became close friends with Jacek Malczewski. However, an anti-Semitic incident at the School of Fine Arts prompted him to leave Krak\u00f3w after less than a year in spite of Malczewski's protests. He traveled to Norway and stayed in Molde. He returned to Vienna and from there travelled to Munich in 1875 to study under Karl von Piloty and Alexander von Wagner. In 1876 he won the Gold Medal at the Munich Academy for his painting, Shylock and Jessica. In the same year, he moved back to Vienna to attend the workshop of Heinrich von Angeli. He lived and worked in Vienna for the next two years and produced paintings with biblical themes, as well as illustrations for Friedrich Bruckmann Publishing of Munich.\n\nParagraph 26: The name Lom Palanka was mentioned for the first time in 1704. The settlement then called Palanka stood between village and town in size and importance. In 1798 Lom suffered from brigand raids. With the development of shipping along the Danube after 1830, the importance of the town grew. The road to Sofia contributed to its progress and turned it into a main export port to Vienna (Austria). By 1869 there were 120 shops, 148 trade offices, 175 food shops, 34 coffee bars, six hotels and two mills. The town was centred on the old Kale (fortress), which was entered through three kapii (gates)\u00a0\u2014 Vidinska, Belogradchishka, Sofiyska. The tradesmen from Lom offered goods at the biggest fairs in the region and beyond. In 1880 there were 7,500 inhabitants in the town.\n\nParagraph 27: After starting a band with his children, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. became the group's manager and began promoting it. The group recorded an album with Freddie Records in 1984, though it was never released. Abraham provided two demos to Charlie Grever, father of Bob Grever owner of Cara Records, who signed then-thirteen year old Selena to the recording label. Manny Guerra, who separated from Cara Records, started his own record label. Guerra wanted to sign Selena to his recording label in 1985. Guerra dissolved the agreement between Cara Records and Selena when it was brought to his attention. Selena recorded five LP records for Manny's GP Productions by 1988, without a contract. Abraham expressed in an interview how he forgot to sign it, and noticed how Guerra stopped asking him about the contract after Selena became more popular. At the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, Selena was approached by Rick Trevino to be the opening act after La Sombra declined the offer. Jose Behar of newly formed EMI Latin and the heads of Sony Music attended the awards ceremony and were scouting for new acts. Behar wanted to sign Selena to his label, while Sony Music was offering twice EMI's offer. Behar believed he had discovered \"the next Gloria Estefan\", which his superior called him illogical since he had only been in Texas for a week. Abraham chose EMI Latin's offer because of the potential for a crossover, and he wanted his children to be the first musicians to sign with the company. Before Selena began recording her debut album, Behar and Stephen Finfer requested a crossover album for her. The singer recorded three English-language songs for the heads of EMI's pop division. Behar and Finfer's request for a crossover album was denied and Selena was told she needed a bigger fan base to sell such an album. Behar thought EMI Records and the public did not believe that a Mexican-American woman could have \"crossover potential\" after Charles Koppelman denied the project. The company believed Selena had potential in Mexico and South American markets when they signed the singer in 1989.\n\nParagraph 28: In response to Turin's 2013 paper, involving deuterated and undeuterated isotopomers of the musk cyclopentadecanone, Block et al. in a 2015 paper in PNAS report that the human musk-recognizing receptor, OR5AN1, identified using a heterologous olfactory receptor expression system and robustly responding to cyclopentadecanone and muscone (which has 30 hydrogens), fails to distinguish isotopomers of these compounds in vitro. Furthermore, the mouse (methylthio)methanethiol-recognizing receptor, MOR244-3, as well as other selected human and mouse olfactory receptors, responded similarly to normal, deuterated, and carbon-13 isotopomers of their respective ligands, paralleling results found with the musk receptor OR5AN1. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the proposed vibration theory of olfaction does not apply to the human musk receptor OR5AN1, mouse thiol receptor MOR244-3, or other olfactory receptors examined. Additionally, theoretical analysis by the authors shows that the proposed electron transfer mechanism of the vibrational frequencies of odorants could be easily suppressed by quantum effects of nonodorant molecular vibrational modes. The authors conclude: \"These and other concerns about electron transfer at olfactory receptors, together with our extensive experimental data, argue against the plausibility of the vibration theory.\" In commenting on this work, Vosshall writes \"In PNAS, Block et al\u2026. shift the \"shape vs. vibration\" debate from olfactory psychophysics to the biophysics of the ORs themselves. The authors mount a sophisticated multidisciplinary attack on the central tenets of the vibration theory using synthetic organic chemistry, heterologous expression of olfactory receptors, and theoretical considerations to find no evidence to support the vibration theory of smell.\" While Turin comments that Block used \"cells in a dish rather than within whole organisms\" and that \"expressing an olfactory receptor in human embryonic kidney cells doesn't adequately reconstitute the complex nature of olfaction...\", Vosshall responds \"Embryonic kidney cells are not identical to the cells in the nose .. but if you are looking at receptors, it's the best system in the world.\" In a Letter to the Editor of PNAS, Turin et al. raise concerns about Block et al. and Block et al. respond. A recent study describes the responses of primary olfactory neurons in tissue culture to isotopes and finds that a small fraction of the population (<1%) clearly discriminates between isotopes, some even giving an all-or-or -none response to H or D isotopomers of octanal. The authors attribute this to \"hypersensitivity\" of some receptors to differences in hydrophobicity between normal and deuterated odorants.\n\nParagraph 29: In his 2011 book That Is All, John Hodgman titles a chapter about taking a cruise \"A Totally Fun Thing I Would Do Again as Soon as Possible\". The name of the 2012 Simpsons episode \"A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again\" also references the title essay. Tina Fey's 2011 memoir Bossypants includes a chapter on her own cruise experience, titled \"My Honeymoon: Or, A Supposedly Fun Thing That I'll Never Do Again Either\", in which she jokingly suggests that those who've heard of Wallace's book should consider themselves members of the \"cultural elite.\" In Charlie Kaufman's 2020 film I'm Thinking of Ending Things, the character Jake mentions the book, refers to E Unibus Pluram, then recites a portion of the essay from the section \"Image-Fiction\" verbatim.\n\nParagraph 30: The embodiment of the Gopher mascot came to life in 1952 when University of Minnesota assistant bandmaster Jerome Glass bought a fuzzy wool gopher suit with a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head and asked one of the band members to climb into it.  \"Goldy\" Gopher (the first name seems to have appeared sometime in the 1960s) became a fixture within the University of Minnesota Marching Band and Pep Band, as each year a band member was chosen to don the suit for that season. Wherever these two bands performed, Goldy was there to glad-hand with the crowd, hug the little kids, torment the cheerleaders and generally add a friendly Minnesota flavor to the event.", "answers": ["Paragraph 30"], "pred": "2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,", "length": 7789, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "25f458b734959c49a6b17fcf3ebe8c17d783b4308eaeaf58"}
{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: The Sisters of Charity were the first Order of Nuns to be established in Australia with their convent being founded at Parramatta in 1838. In the late 1890s the Sisters of Charity were seeking to found an order in the Blue Mountains to provide a place of respite for exhausted nuns \"where they might find fresh vigour for God's work\". It was also noted that there was no Catholic school in or near Katoomba, hence there was an opportunity for the nuns to regain their health and energy whilst conducting their appointed work. The Sisters rented a small cottage close to the Catholic Church and Presbytery in Katoomba and moved in in 1900. A new college called Mount St Mary's opened on the main Street of Katoomba in 1901, and in 1903 Mother Mary Eulalia was appointed Rectress of the college. The Mount St Mary's premises in town eventually proved inadequate for the rapidly increasing student base, so, in 1907, it was decided to purchase substantial acreage to the north of the railway station on which to build a brand new boarding house for girls and convent accommodation for the Sisters. Bridget McGuigan, Julia O'Connor and Helena Bourke of the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity (but denominated on the title deeds as spinsters) purchased the subject site (Lots 26 - 35) from Frank Grimley (The Grimley Subdivision) on 10 June 1907. The site included the cottage known as \"The Rocks\" (designed by Varney Parkes for John Fletcher M.A.) which was located in the south west corner of the site. The cottage and the lands the Sisters were to purchase are associated with Fletcher who had established a boarding college for boys in the mid 1880s called Katoomba College (later known as the Priory and then The Royal Palace) which was located on the opposite side of the road to where St Mary's now stands. Fletcher had purchased additional lands (future St Mary's lands) presumably to provide land for sporting activities, however, the depression of the 1890s led to the closure of his college and the sale of Lots 26 - 35 to Frank Grimley. When the Sisters made their purchase the land had largely been cleared and was characterised by open paddock with the exception of a number of mature eucalypts and \"The Rocks\". The following year on 24 June 1908, an additional  were purchased from Frank Grimley adding orchards and vegetable gardens to an already spacious landscape.\n\nParagraph 2: On 18 December 2012, it was announced that the Welsh Government was interested in buying the airport from its current owners. In 2012, the Airport faced sustained criticism from the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones. On 28 February 2012, Jones announced to the Welsh Assembly: \"We would like to see many routes emerging from Cardiff Airport, but the Airport must get its act together... Last week, I went to the Airport and the main entrance was shut. People could not go in through the main entrance; they had to go through the side entrance. It is important that the Airport puts itself in a position where it is attractive to new airlines, and, unfortunately, that is not the case at present.\" His criticism led to accusations that he was \"talking down\" Cardiff Airport whilst aviation industry professionals commented that he was unqualified to make such comments. However, Jones returned to this theme on 7 March 2012 saying, \"With the condition of the Airport at the moment I would not want to bring people in through Cardiff Airport because of the impression it would give of Wales...I have to say the time has come now for the owners of the Airport to decide to run the Airport properly or sell it.\"\n\nParagraph 3: The final plan was to land soldiers from navy ships on the Lebanese coast who would infiltrate into Beirut disguised as tourists, where they would be picked up by Mossad agents waiting for them with rented cars and driven to their targets. Some of the commandos were to be disguised as women (Barak was disguised as a brunette woman). This was at the suggestion of Elazar, who was concerned that a group of men moving through Beirut at midnight would raise suspicion. In addition to the assassination mission, four PLO facilities were to be attacked. To maintain the element of surprise, the apartments of the three targets would have to be breached before the other attacks could begin. Before the mission, the forces trained using similar apartments in northern Tel Aviv. They also practiced cross-dressing and walking around disguised as lovers. Meanwhile, Mossad agents in Beirut gathered additional intelligence for the raid. Nielsen selected the private beach of the Sands Hotel as the landing site since access was restricted to guests and it was close to the hotel's parking lot, where the commandos could be picked up by Mossad agents. Brigadier General Emmanuel Shaked, the commander of the IDF's infantry and paratrooper forces, was placed in overall command of the operation.\n\nParagraph 4: The ligand GABA is the endogenous compound that causes this receptor to open; once bound to GABA, the protein receptor changes conformation within the membrane, opening the pore in order to allow chloride anions (Cl\u2212) and, to a lesser extent, bicarbonate ions (HCO3\u2212) to pass down their electrochemical gradient. The binding site to GABA is about 80\u00c5 away from the narrowest part of the ion channel. Recent computational studies have suggested an allosteric mechanism whereby GABA binding leads to ion channel opening. Because the reversal potential for chloride in most mature neurons is close to or more negative than the resting membrane potential, activation of GABAA receptors tends to stabilize or hyperpolarise the resting potential, and can make it more difficult for excitatory neurotransmitters to depolarize the neuron and generate an action potential. The net effect therefore typically inhibitory, reducing the activity of the neuron, although depolarizing currents have been observed in response to GABA in immature neurons in early development. This effect during development is due to a modified Cl\u2212 gradient wherein the anions leave the cells through the GABAA receptors, since their intracellular chlorine concentration is higher than the extracellular. The difference in extracellular chlorine anion concentration is presumed to be due to the higher activity of chloride transporters, such as NKCC1, transporting chloride into cells which are present early in development, whereas, for instance, KCC2 transports chloride out cells and is the dominant factor in establishing the chloride gradient later in development. These depolarization events have shown to be key in neuronal development. In the mature neuron, the GABAA channel opens quickly and thus contributes to the early part of the inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP).\n\nParagraph 5: After resisting a shakedown from a group of corrupt police detectives, and then subsequently ditching their surveillance, Frank and his crew are involved in a large-scale diamond heist organized by Leo. All goes well with Frank's \"burn job\" and he is expecting the agreed-upon sum of $830,000 for the unmounted stones with a wholesale value $4 million. But when Frank returns from the job, Leo gives him less than $100,000. This is all that Frank will receive in cash according to Leo, who says he invested the rest of Frank's cut in shopping centers in Fort Worth, Texas and Dallas, Texas, an idea Frank had previously rejected. In addition, Leo sets up a Palm Beach score for Frank in six weeks without consulting him. Frank tells Leo that their deal is over and takes the cash as he leaves, demanding the rest of his money in 24 hours.\n\nParagraph 6: Sirens and Sailors newest EP entitled Wasteland was released on May 29, 2012, via Tragic Hero Records. Wasteland EP includes six tracks produced by Drew Fulk [At The Skylines] at Think Sound Studios in North Carolina. Regarding this album, vocalist Kyle Bihrle was quoted saying, \"We like to say that, \"there is a little something for everybody\" on this record.  Expect all your favorite aspects of our music to be included.  We bring the heavy, we bring the melodic, and we bring the ferocity.\" Sirens and Sailors set out on \"The Wasteland at Sea\" tour (June 2012) in support of this EP. This tour included support from Everyone Dies in Utah and Myka, Relocate. Sirens and Sailors supported headliner Belie My Burial, with additional support from Beheading of a King on the Northeast \"Pale Beyond Tour\" (July 2012). Sirens and Sailors provided direct support to The World We Knew on an East Coast tour (July\u2013August 2012) with additional support from King Conquer. Sirens and Sailors headlined \"The One The Rise Tour\"  (October 2012) with support from Us, From Outside and It Lives It Breathes. Sirens and Sailors supported headliner, Affiance with additional support from A Faylene Sky for a \"mini-tour\" (October\u2013November 2012) through New York, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Sirens and Sailors provided support to headliner, Everyone Dies in Utah with additional support from Affiance and Deception of a Ghost in late November 2012 through the Midwest and West Coast. To begin 2013, Sirens and Sailors provided support to The Air I Breathe on their farewell tour (February 2013), with additional support from For All I Am, Famous Last Words, and This Romantic Tragedy; touring throughout the East Coast and Texas. Sirens and Sailors provided direct support to in Dying Arms on their first headline tour (April\u2013May 2013); covering the East Coast through the Midwest. This tour also featured Mureau and Stand Your Ground. Vocalist Kyle Bihrle provided live guest vocals with Ice Nine Kills on the track \"So This Is My Future\" on May 25, 2013, at Water Street Music Hall in Rochester, New York. On June 4, 2013, the band announced their signing to Artery Recordings and Razor & Tie. On June 7, 2013, the band announced they would be providing support to August Burns Red, For Today, The Color Morale, My Children My Bride, and Fit For a King at the IMATTER Festival 2013; September 7, 2013, at Eldridge Park, Elmira, NY.\n\nParagraph 7: The company is engaged in the supply chain management in the consumer electronics sector, electronic manufacturing services (EMS), creation of technology products, as well as property and equity investments.

It also creates and markets consumer products under its own brand name, YES.\n\nParagraph 8:  is a sentient Plant known as \"The Humanoid Typhoon\" due to the destruction which surrounds him. Wielding a huge silver revolver, he travels from town to town. He is initially discovered by Meryl and Milly, representatives from an insurance agency investigating claims made due to damages caused by the mysterious \"Humanoid Typhoon\". The pair find Vash while he is being chased by bandits who want to collect the bounty on \"The $$60,000,000,000 (sixty billion double dollar) Man\". He and his brother, Knives, were born on a colony ship that was part of a fleet sent to find and settle a new world in order to extend the human race. They were raised by Rem, who instilled upon Vash the philosophy that every being deserves life, and Vash now takes this to the extreme by always attempting to save everyone. Knives on the other hand, sickened by the actions of the humans around him, caused the fleet to crash, which killed Rem and many others. Vash has made it his purpose to hunt down and stop Knives from harming anyone else. Vash was forced to destroy the city of July during one of his confrontations with Knives, which haunts him considerably and starts his reputation.\n\nParagraph 9: The titular mecha of the series. It shows no visible weapons, as it was not built with the intention of being a Metal Fighter in the first place. Instead of that, it relies on a device able to focus a great amount of heat to Red Baron's fists, forearms and legs, giving it the power to pierce through his opponents with ease. It has two finishers attacks: The Electrigger (The Red Baron rises its arms in the air, then places them at the side of its waist as it adopts a Horseman Stance and starts building up power as it prepares to start the attack. Then the technique itself can take many forms: either a single but powerful punch, a barrage of punches, an uppercut when fighting airborne enemies or a forearm strike when equipped with the Forearm Blades, but no matter the variation, it always ends with the Red Baron ramming his arm through his foe and causing them to explode) and the Rolling Thunder (The Red Baron jumps high in the air and starts rolling forward very fast while descending while directing most of his power to either one of its legs, finishing the attack with an axe kick to the enemy's head, causing them to explode). The Red Baron is resistant, if not invulnerable, to fire and high temperatures, rising unscratched when entering in contact with lava. One of the most mysterious facts about the Red Baron is the possibility of it actually being sentient, for example in the first episode it reacts to Ken's presence and only allowing him to pilot it, as well as denying him of the right to pilot it when Ken was acting cocky after winning an important tournament. It also seems to enter some sort of Berserk mode when Ken's own life is at risk or when he has been knocked out while piloting Red Baron. During this mode the Red Baron seems to get a huge power boost and (apparently) even the power to regenerate its damaged part, seen in the fight with the Gold Baron where the Red Baron appears to regenerate a device that was ripped from its chest.\n\nParagraph 10: Like Cavite City (originally called Cavite La Punta) and Noveleta (La Tierra Alta), Imus used to be a part of Cavite el Viejo (now Kawit), whose parish church was built by the Jesuits during the administration of Archdiocese of Manila Archbishop Miguel Garcia Serrano, 1618\u20131629. For more than a century and a half the people of Imus had to endure walking or traveling  of dirt road to attend religious services or transact official business in the city proper. The difficulty of communication between Imus and Cavite el Viejo was a long-standing complaint of the Imuse\u00f1os until another religious order, the Augustinian Recollects, as a consequence of the British occupation of Manila in 1762, established a parish church in Imus, in what is now known as Bayang Luma.\n\nParagraph 11: \"Yolngu Boy is a sensitive but dramatic treatment of the search for identity in modern Australia by three indigenous boys. This is a long overdue film about what it means to be a young indigenous person in Australia today. I hope very many Australians go to see it\". Dr David Kemp, Federal Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs\"...probably the most important Australian film of the year...I wish I could compel every Australian to see it\". Peter Thompson, Sunday, Channel 9\"This is a terrific contribution to the reconciliation process...The film has great honesty, but will also provide greater understanding of indigenous spirituality and culture. There were some images in the film that will stay with me for some time\". Michael Gorton, Co-Chair, Australians for Reconciliation\"I could personally relate to it myself. The dream is stronger than the goal\". Michael Long, Essendon Football Club\"Yolngu Boy is a movie with heart and integrity, but is also insightful, original and intensely compelling\". The Hon Peter McGauran MP, Federal Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation\"Yolngu Boy is one of the most rewarding films that you are likely to see...This is truly a masterpiece of community spirit and a gift to the world. Don't miss this film, a remarkable insight into contemporary Australia. Five out of five\". James Brandis, WA Post\"The film, about three teenagers caught between the modern world and their traditional culture, is a visual feast\". FOCUS, autumn markets\"An edifying film that was both confronting and humbling \u2013 a presentation for all Australians to see\". The Hon. Philip Ruddock, Minister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs\"A really impressive film with incredible energy. I think it showed great insight into a culture that white Australians know nothing about\". Deb Cox, CoxKnight Productions, Creator SeaChange\"Yolngu Boy is realistic and, at times, confronting. It is also an original, beautiful and moving film. It should be seen by all Australians \u2013 because it gives us a deeper understanding of indigenous culture and experiences, while still telling a great story\". The Hon. Steve Bracks MP, Premier of Victoria.\"...this estimable fable for the 21st century deserves as wide an audience as possible. A moving drama about lives in the making and battles against the odds, it is also a compelling adventure yarn with a brain\". Tom Ryan, Sunday Age\"...such an impressive film...you're being presented with parts of Australian life you've never seen before...\" Margaret Pomeranz, SBS Movie ShowSoundtrack\n\nParagraph 12:  Kolkata Urban Agglomeration includes :  Kolkata district: Kolkata (M Corp.), Nadia district: Kalyani (M), Gayespur (M), North 24 Parganas district: Raigachhi (CT), Barasat (M), Madhyamgram (M), Kanchrapara (M),  Nanna (OG), Chakla (OG), Srotribati (OG), Jetia (CT), Halisahar (M), Balibhara (CT), Naihati (M), Noapara (P) (CT), Babanpur (CT), Teghari (CT), Bhatpara (M), Panpur (OG), Kaugachhi (CT), Garshyamnagar (CT), Garulia (M), Ichhapur Defence Estate (CT), North Barrackpur (M), Barrackpur Cantonment (CB), Barrackpur (M), Jafarpur (CT), Ruiya (CT), Titagarh (M), Khardaha (M), Bandipur (CT), Panihati (M), Muragachha (CT), New Barrackpur (M), Chandpur (CT), Talbandha (CT), Patulia (CT), Kamarhati (M), Baranagar (M), South Dum Dum (M), North Dum Dum (M), Dum Dum (M), Rajarhat-Gopalpur (M) [now merged with Bidhannagar (M Corp.)], Bidhannagar (M Corp.), Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (Salt Lake Sector V) (M), West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corp (New Town) (M),  Hooghly district: Dankuni (M Corp) Bansberia (M), Hugli-Chinsurah (M), Bara Khejuria (OG), Shankhanagar (CT),  Amodghata (CT),  Chak Banshberia (CT), Naldanga (CT), Kodalia (CT), Kulihanda (CT), Simla (CT), Dharmapur (CT), Bhadreswar (M), Champdani (M), Chandannagar (M Corp.), Baidyabati (M), Serampore (M), Rishra (M), Rishra (CT), Bamunari (CT), Dakshin Rajyadharpur (CT), Nabagram Colony (CT), Konnagar (M), Uttarpara Kotrung (M), Raghunathpur (PS-Dankuni) (CT), Kanaipur (CT), Keota (CT), Howrah district: Bally (M) [Now merged with Howrah (M Corp.)], Howrah (M Corp.), Bally (CT), Jagadishpur (CT), Chamrail (CT), Eksara (CT), Chakapara (CT), Khalia (CT), Bankra (CT), Nibra (CT), Mahiari (CT), Bipra Noapara (CT), Ankurhati (CT), Kantlia (CT), Salap (CT), Tentulkuli (CT), 83 Argari (CT), Andul (CT), Ramchandrapur (CT), Jhorhat (CT), Hatgachha (CT), Dhuilya (CT), Panchpara (CT), Podara (CT), Banupur (CT), Sankrail (CT), Manikpur (CT), Sarenga (CT), Raghudebbati (CT), Nalpur (CT), Uluberia (M), Chak Srikrishna (OG), Khalisani (CT), Uttar Pirpur (CT), Balarampota (CT), Santoshpur (CT), Domjur (CT), Dakshin Jhapardaha (CT), Makardaha (CT), Khantora (CT), Bhandardaha (CT), Kamranga (CT), Jaypur Bil (CT), South 24 Parganas district: Joka (CT), Chata Kalikapur (CT), Ganye Gangadharpur (CT), Rameswarpur (CT), Asuti (CT), Hanspukuria (CT), Kalua (CT), Ramchandrapur (CT), Samali (CT), Maheshtala (M), Uttar Raypur (CT), Balarampur (CT), Buita (CT), Benjanhari Acharial (CT), Abhirampur (CT), Nischintapur (CT), Birlapur (CT), Chak Kashipur (CT), Chak Alampur (CT), Bowali (CT), Dakshin Raypur (CT), Poali (CT), Pujali (M), Budge Budge (M), Daulatpur (CT), Bhasa (CT), Bishnupur (CT), Kanyanagar (CT), Nahazari (CT), Nadabhanga (CT), Kanganbaria (CT), Bora Gagangohalia (CT), Chanddandaha (CT), Barkalikapur (CT), Patharberia (CT), Ramkrishnapur (CT), Amtala (CT), Kriparampur (CT), Chak Enayetnagar (CT), Maricha (CT), Bhangar Raghunathpur (CT), Gobindapur (CT), Radhanagar (CT), Danga (CT), Ramchandrapur (CT), Bidyadharpur (CT), Kalikapur (CT), Chak Baria (CT), Sahebpur (CT), Rajpur Sonarpur (M), Petua (CT), Garia (CT), Panchghara (CT), Mallikpur (CT), Hariharpur (CT), Champahati (CT), Solgohalia (CT), Naridana (CT), Salipur (CT), Khodar Bazar (CT), Komarhat (CT), Baruipur (M), Raynagar (CT), Kalikapur Barasat (CT), Baharu (CT), Uttarparanij (CT), Alipur (CT), Uttar Durgapur (CT), Jaynagar Majilpur (M).\n\nParagraph 13: The three main drivers for the team, Andretti, Hunter-Reay, and Hinchcliffe, all returned for 2013. In addition, E. J. Viso was added as a fourth car for the season, in conjunction with HVM Racing. Rookie driver Carlos Mu\u00f1oz would also drive an entry for the team in the Indy 500. Mu\u00f1oz and Zach Veach would be the team's drivers in the lower level Indy Lights series. Andretti would also have entries in the Pro Mazda Championship and the U.S. F2000 National Championship, the feeder series to IndyCar (the \"Road to Indy\").  The season started strong as Hinchcliffe won the season's first race, the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, his first IndyCar Series victory. In the second race, the Grand Prix of Alabama, Hinchcliffe suffered a breakdown and would be stuck on the side for most of the race watching teammate Hunter-Reay go on to victory to make the team two for two. The streak broke in week three, with both Hinchcliffe and Hunter-Reay exiting the race early. High and low would go on to be a theme for the team that season. Hinchcliffe would go on to win two more races, but a variety of mechanical problems would see him finish the year eighth. Hunter-Reay would have a similar season, winning two races but finishing the season a disappointing seventh following his 2012 championship. Conversely, Andretti would stay near the top of the standings for most of the season after starting by finishing no worse than 7th in seven of his first eight races, but after two early third-place finishes, he would not see the podium the remainder of the year and finished the season in 5th place. Viso, meanwhile who came into the team with a reputation for being involved in collisions, showed flashes of success, including a fourth-place finish at Milwaukee, but had only two top-ten finishes, a fifth and a ninth, in his final eight races, before dropping out of the season finale stating he had food poisoning. He was replaced for the race by Carlos Mu\u00f1oz. Mu\u00f1oz provided a thrill for the team in the Indy 500, taking second place in his first-ever start in the IndyCar series.\n\nParagraph 14: In April 2008, private nurse Janet Ketring appears in Llanview, helping Lee Ramsey care for a bedridden and amnesiac Marty Saybrooke. Ramsey is killed and Todd Manning secretly takes custody of Marty, who all of Llanview believes had been killed in an explosion in December 2007. Todd coerces Janet to continue tending to Marty under his employ. For the sum of $1 million, Janet also agrees to keep Marty's existence a secret. Neither Marty nor Janet are aware that Todd had raped Marty over a decade before. Seeking absolution for his crimes against Marty at any cost, Todd lies about their relationship as well as the existence of Marty's son. During a conversation with Todd, Janet reveals that she is estranged from her loved ones and claims she is \"dead to them.\" Llanview Police Detective John McBain discovers that Janet is, in fact, Lee Halpern. He uses this information to try to pressure Janet into revealing that her mystery patient is, as he now suspects, the presumed-dead Marty. Janet is horrified to hear from John that Todd had raped Marty and is keeping her from her son. Janet confronts Todd, who also knows her true identity and threatens to expose her unless she continues to keep his secret. He soon forces her to assist him in his intended kidnapping of his unborn grandchild. Todd calls off the plan, but his mentally ill niece Jessica Buchanan switches her own stillborn baby girl with the new-born daughter of Todd's daughter Starr Manning. With Starr's baby believed dead, Janet leaves Llanview on November 11, 2008, but reappears on Renee Buchanan's doorstep on January 9, 2009, desperate for sanctuary. Janet fears prosecution and Todd's wrath, but soon agrees to cooperate with the authorities. Todd catches her wearing a wire, but Janet is kept in protective custody. Todd publishes an expos\u00e9 on Janet in his newspaper, The Sun, to sabotage her credibility before the upcoming trial. Terrified that one of the people she had conned will come after her, Janet escapes police custody. Todd discovers Janet stabbed to death on his living room floor on January 30, 2009. Believing that Todd is innocent but realizing that he would be blamed, T\u00e9a confesses to the police that she had stabbed Janet in selfdefense, and Janet's body is taken away. Powell Lord III later confesses to the murder, as part of his plan to punish anyone who has hurt Marty and punish Todd.\n\nParagraph 15: The outbreak of War put an end to his career in local government. In anticipation of a Soviet invasion and the consequent occupation of the Wilno region - moves which were the fulfillment of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Stanis\u0142aw made his way through the still autonomous Lithuania. He hoped to reach France from there, and join the fight against Germany. It was not easy despite the fact that he had a valid French visa. The Lithuanian Government, in an attempt to ingratiate themselves with the Nazi government, banned all young people from leaving the country. Everybody knew that young person would try to join the Polish Army which was just being formed in France, in order to continue fighting against Hitler. Using his quick wits and a false medical certificate of tuberculosis (given to him by a friendly doctor from Kaunas), he overcome many obstacles, travelling through Latvia, Estonia and Sweden. In November 1939 he arrived in France and on 18 December 1939 signed up as a soldier of the Polish Army. His army identity document bears the number 3138, and the date 30 December 1939. He served in the Arm\u00e9e Polonaise first as a lieutenant commanding a platoon of grenadiers, and then as an aide-de-camp (adjutant). Finally, he was promoted as Commander of the Headquarters of the 6th Regiment of the 2nd Division of Infantry. His division had a chance to fight the enemy, but after its defeat at Ma\u00eeche, the division was given orders to cross the border to Switzerland. Once there, the soldiers were sent to an internment camp. After only a week, Stanis\u0142aw Radziwon secretly left the camp for France in an attempt to reach Great Britain and pursue his fight against the Nazis. He vividly described his dramatic escapades and ordeals, in stories published in Wiadomo\u015bci (published in Scotland) [1]. After many ups and downs he reached Paris, where he hid in a convent. He was able to obtain forged French identity documents and bicycled all the way to the Pyrenees, helped on his way by friendly local people. There he met smuggler who had been recommended to him and was led by him through the mountains to the outskirts of San Sebastian in Spain. However, the Guardia Civil arrested and imprisoned him and later sent him by train to France again. He escaped from the train, only to be arrested by the Gestapo. Sentenced to death, he miraculously escaped with his life. Relentlessly, he forced his way to Spain again and then to Portugal, where in July 1941 he received his Polish passport from the Legacio da Polonia (Rua das Amoreiras 105 in Lisbon). The passport was issued by the Consular Section in Bern, Switzerland. On 5 August 1941 he received a British visa. The document declared: \u2018Permitted to land in the United Kingdom on condition that the holder reports at once to the Polish Army headquarters in the United Kingdom and is subject to such further conditions as the Secretary of State may at any time impose\u2019. In a secret British military operation he and other volunteers were then transported from the coast to a boat and then sailed to Gibraltar. He waited six weeks in Gibraltar and finally arrived in Great Britain on 17 October 1941. The next day he was officially drafted into the Army.  After lengthy training in England he was sent to Scotland, where in 1943 he joined the 2nd Infantry Battalion, commonly called the \u2018Tartan Lions\u2019.\n\nParagraph 16: At the start of World War I, the head office was temporarily relocated to Bordeaux, but returned to the capital in November 1914. Both shortly before and after the war, the CIC further strengthened its network outside of Paris by acquiring a 60% majority stake in the  in October 1913, a 11% stake in the  in May 1914, and a 22% stake in the  in April 1921. In 1919, the CIC also acquired a 29.5% stake in the  in Caen (est. 1913), and in November 1919 created a majority-owned subsidiary, the , whose head office was relocated to Strasbourg in March 1922. Also in November 1919, it took a 25% stake in the Banque Dupont in Valenciennes (est. 1819), and in 1920 a 33% stake in the Banque Scalbert in Lille (est. 1838). The CIC further developed this strategy of stake-building when financial stress hit several regional banks in subsequent years. It took a 33% stake in  in June 1924, a 20% stake in  (est. 1913) in December 1924, a 28% stake in  in September 1926, a 33% stake in  (BRO, est. 1913) in 1927, and a stake in  in 1930. In 1929, the CIC created a central body for its regional banks, the . By then, it was the fifth-largest French bank by assets, behind the Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris, and Banque Nationale de Cr\u00e9dit. The CIC's participation in bank restructurings in the early 1930s strengthened the , which renamed itself Cr\u00e9dit Industriel d'Alsace et de Lorraine (CIAL) in May 1931, and the . In June 1931 the CIC also created the , of which it owned 80% of equity, but sold it in 1937 to the . In March 1932, the CIC engineered the merger of its ,  and  to form the  (CIN), which also absorbed the  in March 1935. In August 1936, the CIC sold most of its majority stake in the .\n\nParagraph 17: These examples of applications took place during the 2018 Advanced Naval Technology exercises, in August at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport. The first example of unmanned underwater vehicles was displayed by Northrop Grumman with their air drop sonobuoy's from a fire scout aircraft. Throughout the demonstration the company used the: e Iver3-580 (Northrop Grumman AUV) to display their vehicles ability to sweep for mines, while also displaying their real-time target automated recognition system. Another company, Huntington Ingalls Industries, presented their version of an unmanned underwater vehicle named Proteus. The Proteus is a dual-mode undersea vehicle developed by Huntington and Battelle, the company during the presentation displayed their unmanned underwater vehicle capabilities by conducting a full-kill demonstration on sea bed warfare. During the demonstration the vehicle utilized a synthetic aperture sonar which was attached to both the port and starboard of the craft, which allowed the unmanned underwater vehicle to identify the targets placed underwater and to ultimately eliminate them. Ross Lindman (director of operations at the company's technical solution's fleet support group) stated that \"The big significance of this is that we ran the full kill chain\". \"We ran a shortened version of an actual mission. We didn\u2019t say, \u2018Well we\u2019re doing this part and you have to imagine this or that.\u2019 We ran the whole thing to illustrate a capability that can be used in the near term.\" The final demonstration for unmanned underwater vehicles was displayed by General Dynamics, the company showcased their cross-domain multi-platform UUV through a theater simulating warfare planning tool. Through the utilization of this simulation, they showed a Littoral combat ship along with two unmanned underwater vehicles. The goal of this exercise was to demonstrate the communication speed between the operator and the UUV. James Langevin, D-R.I., ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s subcommittee on emerging threats, stated in regard to this exercise \"What this is all driving to is for the warfare commander to be able to make the decisions that are based on what he thinks is high-confidence input quicker than his adversary can,\" he said. \"That\u2019s the goal \u2014 we want to be able to \u2026 let them make warfare-related decisions quicker than anybody else out there.\" These exercises were conducted to showcase the applications of unmanned underwater vehicles within the military community, along with the innovations each company created to better suite these specific mission types.\n\nParagraph 18: McMurray's entry into Cup racing did not go as planned. McMurray was scheduled to drive a limited schedule in a No. 42 Chip Ganassi Racing Dodge in 2002, in preparation for a full-time 2003 rookie of the year campaign in the No. 42 with new sponsor Texaco/Havoline. However, he was instead tapped as interim replacement for injured Ganassi Cup driver Sterling Marlin, who fractured a vertebra in a crash at Kansas Speedway. Thus, McMurray made his Cup debut in the No. 40 Coors Light Dodge at Talladega. One week later, at Charlotte, in just his second career NASCAR Winston Cup and first non-restrictor plate start, McMurray outraced the Joe Gibbs Racing Pontiacs of Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart to win the UAW-GM Quality 500. McMurray had been consistent the entire night, and led 96 of the final 100 laps to score the win. It is considered one of the biggest upsets in NASCAR history. This win set a modern-era record for fewest starts before a win (which has since been tied only by Trevor Bayne in the 2011 Daytona 500), and it was also the first time a driver won in their first start at a 1.5-mile track. McMurray drove for six of the remaining seven races, except for the Old Dominion 500 at Martinsville, with Mike Bliss driving as scheduled in the No. 40.\n\nParagraph 19: The following night, Hikage sees Aya suffering from a nightmare. He holds her to try and comfort her, but immediately hears screaming coming from the forest. He rushes to the source of the screaming only to find Taichi and one of the Takeda ninja he spoke with earlier dead, along with another badly injured Takeda ninja. A spider y\u014dma attacks, but Hikage uses shuriken to drive it off, seeing a brief, transparent vision of Marou in the y\u014dma's wake. Before dying, the injured ninja reveals that Marou is a \"child born of the ground\" and that everyone in the Takeda village knew about it, but never discussed it. Left with this mystery, Hikage confronts Aya with Taichi's death, only for her to deny it. When Aya goes to her house to store some water, she hears Ito's voice asking her to do her a favor that night. Hikage goes down to the riverbank to find that the bodies of Taichi and the dead ninja, along with the bloodstains and weapons, have disappeared without explanation. Hikage hears Aya singing unusually late that night and goes to investigate. He finds Aya being held in a different spider y\u014dma's mandibles and attacks it. It drops Aya, but soon runs away with Hikage in pursuit. He arrives at the temple and finds the priest from the waterfall standing before him on the path. He tells Hikage that he is erasing the villager's memories in order to ripen them for Kikuga no Miko's (the demon lord y\u014dma of the land) revival after revealing the fact that he was the spider yoma from before. On the verge of death from a short battle, the priest/y\u014dma warns Hikage about the suicide of the entire village should he die, which Hikage proceeds to kill him anyway. Aya wakes up and remembers how she got her scar, the priest's spell having worn off when he died. It was assumed that she drowned herself. Hikage finds a seemingly unconscious Ito and rushes to her aide. However, she wakes up and restrains Hikage but he was able to kill her also. Hikage enters the shrine and destroys the buddha statue to reveal an egg that he quickly cuts open. The egg opens to reveal Marou feasting on Taichi's severed head. A speechless Hikage approaches him, but Marou attacks him, causing the entire building to come crashing down. Outside, a fully dressed Marou walks away, giving the broken building a final glance before departing.\n\nParagraph 20: The region of Cuyo has an arid climate or a semi-arid climate with an average annual precipitation of about  that is generally unreliable from year to year. The region, which encompasses a wide range of latitudes combined with elevations ranging from 500 m to nearly 7,000 m means that it has a diverse range of different climates. In general, most of the region has a temperate climate with higher elevation valleys having a more milder climate. At the highest elevations (over 4,000 m), icy conditions persist year round.  The diurnal range is very large with very hot temperatures during the day followed by cold nights. Amongst all locations in Argentina, the region has the largest diurnal range in the country with areas in San Juan Province having a diurnal range exceeding . The Andes prevent rain\u2013bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean from coming in, while its latitude puts it in a band of the sub-tropical high pressure belt keeping this region dry. With very low humidity, abundant sunshine throughout the year, and a temperate climate, the region is suitable for wine production. Droughts are often frequent and prolonged. The Cuyo region is influenced by the subtropical, semi\u2013permanent South Atlantic anticyclone to the east in the Atlantic, the semi-permanent South Pacific anticyclone to the west of the Andes, the development of a low pressure system (\"Chaco low\") over northern Argentina and westerlies in the southern parts of the region. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer, when hot temperatures and high insolation lead to the development of a low pressure system (\"Chaco low\") situated over northern Argentina that interacts with the South Atlantic anticyclone to generate a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the region, favouring precipitation, which mostly occurs in the form of convective thunderstorms. More than 85% of the annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which represents the warm season. In contrast, the winter months are dry due to these systems weakening, and the lower insolation that weakens the Chaco low over northern Argentina. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. As such, most of Mendoza province and San Juan province receive the lowest annual precipitation with mean summer precipitation averaging less than  and in rare cases, no summer rainfall. Further eastwards in San Luis province, mean summer rainfall averages around  and can exceed  in some areas. Higher elevation locations receive precipitation in the form of snow during the winter months. In the Cuyo region, annual precipitation is highly variable from year to year and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4\u20135, 6\u20138, and 16\u201322 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic anticyclone are stronger, which causes more moisture towards this region while during the dry years, these winds are weaker.\n\nParagraph 21: After the outbreak of hostilities on 19 December 1946, the French Union forces had made significant progress by capturing the cities of Haiphong, Hanoi, L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, Cao B\u1eb1ng and most of the western and southern regions of Tonkin, which was the stronghold of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh movement. The reasons for the fast advance were the superior firepower, naval and air support of the French forces. The main force of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh was nearly surrounded by the French in the eastern part of Tonkin. There remained only a greater gap between the towns of Cao B\u1eb1ng in the north and Y\u00ean B\u00e1i in the south. During April 1947 Ho Chi Minh made a last attempt to achieve a ceasefire and to continue the independence negotiations with the French government from 1946. The French only demanded his surrender, because the position of the Vietnamese forces seemed to be desperate. On 26 April, Ho refused the French, offering: \"In the French Union is no place for cowards. I would be one, if I would accept.\" During the spring and the summer, the French attacked the bases of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh troops in Tonkin but could not bring them to battle; the Vi\u1ec7t Minh returned when the French moved on.\n\nParagraph 22: One of the Kirunda textile factories where Mr. Batte, Sanyu's dad works as a foreman, gets damaged in a fire. Nalweyiso, Sanyu's step-mum, forces her to sign a contract she hasn't read through.This was a contract to work for the Kirundas as a maid. Litle did she know, life with the Kirundas was much more complicated than it appeared. At the Kirundas', Sanyu finds the complicated family that owns Kirunda House of Designs.The youngest son of the family, Oscar Gume falls for her and she reciprocates his feelings although she tries to hide it. She later helps troublesome Melissa, youngest daughter of Linda Kirunda with her outfit that appears on a magazine cover. While the rest of the maids, Karungi, Nanziri & Kakai enjoy Francis Kirunda's company, Sanyu doubts he's a good husband as she had earlier seen him in the company of Patience who Sanyu suspects to be his mistress. This is later proven right when Francis goes to meet Patience in a hotel room who then threatens to expose the truth to the media .To stop this, Francis takes her home which annoys Linda and she fights with Patience causing her to stress out and leads her into drinking. However, Sanyu stops her from consuming alcohol by advising her to draw and take orange juice instead. Patience lies about carrying Francis's baby but Sanyu overhears her talking to a doctor to forge scans. Later, Oscar sees Sanyu's designs which are amazing and suggests they are used in Kirunda house of designs. Later, Sanyu encounters Oscar's fianc\u00e9e Kirabo who, out of insecurity, instantly hates her and yet her brother Pius falls for her. Kirabo later leaves Oscar at the altar and runs with business tycoon, Steve. Meanwhile, the eldest son of the house, Patrick together with his wife Lucy attempt to steal Linda's assets but are unsuccessful. Sanyu and Linda partner and create designs preparing for a fashion show. Lucy, with maid Karungi's help steals designs from Linda and makes the exact same clothes and signs up to compete in the show.He models go first and she is alter devastated when Linda's models are wearing completely different designs made by Sanyu hence Linda wins.But as the police arrest Lucy for theft, she accuses Sanyu of giving the designs to her causing her imprisonment when none not even Linda believes her.She loses her job and meets her friend ,Atwine who started out as an enemy but after Sanyu saves her, they become good friends.Sanyu gets bailed out by her dad and she alter gets a job at Lightning company of designs where her boss,George falls for her and her designs.George is Oscar's cousin.Later, Patrick starts drug abuse due to stress from Lucy and Lucy desperately wants a child yet she bears curses of her abandoned child Kule.In an attempt to prove her innocence to the Kirundas about the theft ,Sanyu gets two identities Sanyu & Sasha whereby Sanyu is George's assistant and Sasha is Oscar's assistant.\n\nParagraph 23: The first mentions of the home in Lubomierz were recorded in 1398. The number of family estates, starting with Gd\u00f3w and Szczyrzyca which the family also possessed in the 13th century, increased significantly. In the 17th and 18th centuries they were located in Lubomierz, Nowy Wi\u015bnicz, Bochnia, Wieliczka, \u0141a\u0144cut, Baran\u00f3w Sandomierski, Pu\u0142awy, Rzesz\u00f3w, R\u00f3wne, Tarn\u00f3w, Jaros\u0142aw, Przeworsk, and Janowiec upon the Vistula, among others. To this day, the castle in Nowy Wi\u015bnicz has been the property of the Family Association of the Princes Lubomirski. Many estates were located in the territories of the largest Polish cities: Warsaw (e.g. Mokot\u00f3w, Ujazd\u00f3w, Czerniak\u00f3w), Krak\u00f3w (Wola Justowska, Kamienica Pod Baranami), Rzesz\u00f3w (castle), Sandomierz, and Lvov. Maintaining foreign residences in Drezno, Vienna, and Paris enhanced family prestige. The members of the family were referred to as \"the owners of the bank of the Dnieper River\" because many of their estates were located in what is now Ukraine and Slovakia. The Lubomirski family enjoyed political, military, and economic influence, which was concentrated in the provinces of Krak\u00f3w, Sandomierz, Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w, and Ruthenia, to eventually cover the whole area of the Commonwealth of the Two Nations. They kept this state of ownership until the collapse of the Polish state, when they were deprived of many estates as a result of penalties for pro-independence activities.\n\nParagraph 24: Bellamy is primarily a rock 'n' roll and country-and-western singer. In the late 1950s, he played in a band and later a duo with Alan Klein. Bellamy decided to audition for a group formed by Joe Meek that was advertised in the music press. It was this audition that determined that Bellamy would play rhythm guitar for the Tornados, who were firstly a session band for Meek. However, the group reached new heights with their instrumental \"Telstar\", which reached number one all over the world and was the first British rock song to be a number-one single in the United States. Bellamy wrote one of The Tornados' tracks, \"Ridin' the Wind\", which also was a hit single in the USA.\n\nParagraph 25: On November 10 in Korakuen Hall, Nakamura was renamed to Ben-K, based on the legend of 12th century warrior monk Sait\u014d Musashib\u014d Benkei. In his first match as Ben-K, he and Shun Watanabe (now known as Shun Skywalker) lost to Jimmy Susumu and Jimmy Kagetora. On December 25 at Final Gate 2016, he got his first title shot in Dragon Gate, pairing up with Kotoka and Masato Yoshino to challenge for the Open the Triangle Gate Championship in a three-way match won by the Jimmyz (Jimmy Kanda, Jimmy Susumu and Ryo \"Jimmy\" Saito). In early 2017, Naruki Doi and Big R Shimizu made a call to the entire roster, looking for a third man to help them challenge for the Triangle Gate belts. Ben accepted, and on March 20, they defeated VerserK (Shingo Takagi, T-Hawk and \"brother\" Yasshi) to win the vacant titles. On May 4, Doi and Yoshino announced the formation of their new stable, known as \"MaxiMuM\", with Kotoka, Big R Shimizu and Ben-K announced as the members, along with themselves. During May, Ben-K took part in his first King of Gate tournament, but struggled greatly, earning just one win over Yosuke\u2665Santa Maria. On July 1, MaxiMuM dropped the Triangle Gate titles to VerserK (Shingo Takagi, El Lindaman and Takashi Yoshida). On November 3 at the Gate of Destiny, Ben-K and Big R Shimizu, who called themselves \"Big Ben\", unsuccessfully challenged Cima and Dragon Kid for the Open the Twin Gate Championship. On February 11, 2018, he received a non-title singles match against then Open the Dream Gate Champion Masaaki Mochizuki, in which he dominated and beat the champion in just over two minutes. After the match, he challenged Mochizuki to a match for the Dream Gate title, which was accepted and set up for March 4 at Champion Gate in Osaka. After 23 minutes, Ben-K lost a hard-fought bout by referee's decision and failed to capture the title. On May 6 at Dead or Alive, Big Ben won the Twin Gate championships, defeating Antias (Eita and T-Hawk). Ben-K once again entered the King of Gate tournament in 2018 and fared much better than the previous year. He earned 5 points, however, a loss to Yamato eliminated him. On July 22 at Kobe World Pro Wrestling Festival, Big Ben lost the Twin Gate titles to Tribe Vanguard (BxB Hulk and Yamato) and not long after Big R Shimizu turned his back on MaxiMuM and joined heel unit Antias, effectively breaking up Big Ben. However, the break-up would not last long, as on September 6 in Korakuen, Ben-K himself turned heel for the first time in his career, betraying MaxiMuM to join Antias with Big R.\n\nParagraph 26: Also known as \"Fault\" or \"Defect\". When held steady or flashing, it means that a trouble condition exists on the panel.  Trouble conditions are often activated by a contaminated smoke detector or an electrical problem within the system.  Trouble conditions are also activated by a zone being disabled, a circuit or NAC being disabled, low power on the backup battery, disabling of a notification appliance, ground faults, or short or open circuits.  Usually the alarm panel's sounder will activate if a trouble condition exists, though older systems would sometimes activate a bell or other audible signal connected to the panel.  In a trouble condition, the panel displays the zone or devices causing the condition. Usually, the \"Trouble\" indicator goes out automatically when the situation causing the trouble condition is rectified; however in some systems the panel must be manually reset to clear the trouble alarm. Some panels have more specific indicators such as \"Trouble-PSU\" which shows when the panel itself is compromised, and \"Trouble-Bell\" or \"NAC Trouble\" (\"Sounder Fault\" on UK panels) which shows that the notification appliances are not functioning or connected correctly. On most panels, an acknowledge button is pressed to turn off the panel's sounder.\n\nParagraph 27: The first minister was appointed in 1702 was Joseph Twemlow, who was born in Cheshire in 1673. The first record of his pastorate was to baptize Hannah Harper on 7 June 1702. He also opened a school in his own house in 1715 for teaching poor children of Protestant Dissenters in the Dursley area in Water Street, where it provided education for local children for the next hundred and seventy two years. After this it became the Twemlow Trust, giving grants to children and young people to help with their education and training. Retiring in 1738 and died on 22 August 1740 aged 67 and is buried in the churchyard. Nicholas Martyn became the next pastor in 1738, and received the annual sum of \u00a340. In 1745, he was succeeded by Hornblower, who was ordained in 1745 and whose ministry ended in 1766. The next minister was Rev Perry Bartlett from 1767. Bartlett stayed until 1771 when he was succeeded by William Billingsley in 1772, but Billingsley died of tuberculosis in 1776. Rev John Thomas became pastor and served for forty years. In 1806, he married Miss Mary Dyer of Cromhall. Thomas died in 1816 and his wife in 1840. Rev Thomas Griffiths succeeded Thomas and oversaw the completion of the renovation and remodelling of the chapel in June 1818. Rev C. Thomas, who had been pastor of North Nibley Tabernacle, succeeded Griffiths and  was joined in the pastorate by Andrew Gazard in 1842. Thomas died in 1861, and Gazard continued as pastor and bought the land for the Quarry Independent Chapel at the cost of \u00a314 and oversaw the building being built for \u00a3130 and opened in 1852. Gazard died on 22 August 1869, and he was succeeded by Rev James Williams in 1871. Williams stayed in ministry for twenty-one years, during which time a new Sweetland organ from Bath was installed at the cost of \u00a3200 in 1881. He resigned his pastorate in 1893. In 1894, Rev David Truss of the New Metropolitan Tabernacle, London, became pastor and lived in the old Manse in Lower Cam. He attended the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the new church classrooms of that year; these classrooms were opened on May Day 1895. On 28 May 1905, Truss ended his time as pastor. Owen Griffiths became pastor in March 1907, encouraging the membership to sign the Temperance Book and take \"The Pledge\" to abstain from all intoxicating drinks. He resigned his pastorate in 1919.\n\nParagraph 28: Djedefhor enters the palace and goes immediately to his father, king Khufu. The prince says: \u201cMay thy majesty live, be blessed and being prosperous! I have brought Djedi to you!\u201d Khufu replies: \u201cGo and bring him to me!\u201d Then Khufu takes place in the royal audience-hall. The Pharaoh receives Djedi with the words: \u201cWhat is it, Djedi, this denying to have seen you ever before?\u201d Djedi answers: \u201cOh sovereign, my lord! Only the one who is summoned is one who will come. I was summoned, and now see, oh sovereign, my lord, I have come.\u201d The pharaoh continues: \u201cIs it true, this talk-about that you could mend a severed head?\u201d Djedi says: \u201cYes, oh sovereign, my lord. May you live, be blessed and prosperous. I know how to do that.\u201d Khufu replies: \u201cMay a prisoner, who is jailed, be brought to me, so that his execution may be enforced.\u201d. Djedi refuses with the words: \u201cNot to make a human suffer, oh sovereign, my lord! May you live, be blessed and prosperous. You see, it was never allowed to do something like that on the noble flock.\u201d Djedi chooses three animals instead - first a goose. He decapitates the goose and places her head at the eastern side of the audience hall, the body at the western side. Then Djedi utters a secret spell and the head of the goose stands up, starting to waddle. Then the body of the goose stands up and waddles, too. Both body-parts move into equal directions, then melt together. The resurrected goose now leaves the hall cackling. The same performance is done with an undefined water bird and a bull. Both animals are brought successfully back to life, too. Now the king says: \u201cIt is said that you know the number of Iput inside the wenet-sanctuary of Thoth. Now?\u201d Djedi replies: \u201cMay you be praised, oh sovereign, my lord! I don't know their number. But I know where they can be found.\u201d Khufu asks: \u201cWhere is it?\u201d Djedi answers: \u201cThere is a box of scrolls, made of flint, which is stored in a room called \u2018archive\u2019 at Heliopolis.\u201d The king orders: \u201cTake that box!\u201d Djedi replies: \u201cMay your highness be prosperous and blessed, I'm not the one who can bring it to you.\u201d Khufu asks: \u201cWho may be the one who could bring it to me?\u201d Djedi answers: \u201cThe eldest of the three children in the womb of Rededjet, he will bring it to you.\u201d The king says: \u201cI really wish all these things you say. Who is it, this Rededjet?\u201d Djedi replies: \u201cIt's the wife of a wab-priest of the god Ra, lord of Sachebu. The god has adumbrated, that the eldest of the three shall worship as a high priest of Heliopolis over the whole realm.\u201d The king's mood becomes grim after this. Djedi asks: \u201cWhat is that heart of thine, oh sovereign, my lord, becoming so sad! Is it because of the children I have adumbrated? First your son, then his son and then one of them.\u201d Khufu replies: \u201cWhen will this Rededjet give birth?\u201d Djedi says: \u201cIt will happen during the first month of the peret-season, on the fifteenth day.\u2033 Khufu becomes indignant: \u201cBut it's when the canal-of-two-Mugilidae is cut off!? I would even work with my very own hands to enter them! And then I will visit that temple of Ra, lord of Sachebu.\u201d And Djedi says: \u201cThen I will make the waters at the fordable spots of the canal-of-two-Mugilidae become four cubits in height for you.\u201d Khufu stands up and orders: \u201cHave Djedi assigned to a place within the palace of my son Djedefhor where he shall live from now on. His daily gainings be 1000 loaves of bread, 100 jars of beer, one neat and 100 bundles of field garlic.\u201d And all things are done as ordered.\n\nParagraph 29: Three women fight against rules; Claire's struggle with alcohol and her fragile consistency, Bridget's courage (abused by Claire's fearsome husband once) being a prostitute and face the sexual harassment of the dirty and dominant Sheriff Jake and finally Maxine with her courage and strong character in several memorial scenes; for example: Threatening Jake with death if necessary in order to stop the cruel execution of her husband, do the same with \"The Kid\" when he tries to steal a coin and when finding the kidnapped widows by the corrupt \"Pinkerton\" cowboys, rescue a poor wounded Claire (whipped by John and tortured with thermal water by David), neutralize the blond cowboy John with one shot after giving him a chance to regret and force the other cowboy David to disrobe, strip and disappear and threaten to kill him if he doesn't what Mrs. Thornton says: Flee embarrassed totally naked into the desert and hiding amongst rocks in the night (who desperately meets the preacher and his group of Mexican partners; Roberto and Segundo, the next day and after making fun of him, is killed in cold blood by the Hangman in a single shoot). Claire recovers from her injuries and together the three women set off for Jerico again when they met \"The Kid\" who guides them to a cave and steals their expensive horse. These women find refuge in the tavern of a dear friend of Bridget's (Madame Dubois) until they are found by Jake who offers them a deal in search of the money. Claire escapes at dawn while Maxine and Bridget go looking for her, find her, and they are helped by \"The Stranger\" who turns out to be just another \"Thornton\" in search of fortune. The women finally face the powerful in a final battle in which slow characters do not survive in the hot desert climate, as Roberto, who is mortally wounded by The Preacher's men and his brother-in-law (Segundo) who is neutralized by Claire while trying to kidnap her and Bridget. Women face horrible enemies to defeat especially against rivals as dashing as the old preacher or hangman; so bloody and wicked as to enjoy the sorrows of others, betray, kill and humiliate one of the \"Pinkerton\" cowboys leaving his naked body (David) ready for coyotes in the desert afternoon, beat \"The Stranger\" in a ramshackle cabin being challenged, use the God's word at his convenience, publicly make fun of \"The Thornton\" and torture them, intimidate the widows, retain Maxine (who defends herself and confronts him with an iron weapon) neutralize with a lethal shot the banker Van Damn (who throughout history is seen suffering the loss of his beloved Greta and thirsty for revenge and money) after confessing that he buried Greta with the three \"Thornton\" 'Bandidos ' in a dirty cave, to be finally neutralized by the wild Bridget.\n\nParagraph 30: Latter Day Saint scripture teaches that a person may also be called through their lineage, so that they have a legal right to a priesthood office.  The Doctrine and Covenants (D&C) teaches that descendants of Aaron have legal right to the priesthood: \"And if they be literal descendants of Aaron, they have a legal right to the bishopric, if they are the firstborn among the sons of Aaron.\"  In a revelation recorded by Joseph Smith,  recorded in the D&C, he was promised his lineage would have the priesthood: \"Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers\u2014For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God\u2014Therefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.\"\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text provides a detailed list of areas included in the Kolkata Urban Agglomeration.

The list includes multiple municipalities, corporations, and townships within these districts.", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Sisters of Charity were the first Order of Nuns to be established in Australia with their convent being founded at Parramatta in 1838. In the late 1890s the Sisters of Charity were seeking to found an order in the Blue Mountains to provide a place of respite for exhausted nuns \"where they might find fresh vigour for God's work\". It was also noted that there was no Catholic school in or near Katoomba, hence there was an opportunity for the nuns to regain their health and energy whilst conducting their appointed work. The Sisters rented a small cottage close to the Catholic Church and Presbytery in Katoomba and moved in in 1900. A new college called Mount St Mary's opened on the main Street of Katoomba in 1901, and in 1903 Mother Mary Eulalia was appointed Rectress of the college. The Mount St Mary's premises in town eventually proved inadequate for the rapidly increasing student base, so, in 1907, it was decided to purchase substantial acreage to the north of the railway station on which to build a brand new boarding house for girls and convent accommodation for the Sisters. Bridget McGuigan, Julia O'Connor and Helena Bourke of the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity (but denominated on the title deeds as spinsters) purchased the subject site (Lots 26 - 35) from Frank Grimley (The Grimley Subdivision) on 10 June 1907. The site included the cottage known as \"The Rocks\" (designed by Varney Parkes for John Fletcher M.A.) which was located in the south west corner of the site. The cottage and the lands the Sisters were to purchase are associated with Fletcher who had established a boarding college for boys in the mid 1880s called Katoomba College (later known as the Priory and then The Royal Palace) which was located on the opposite side of the road to where St Mary's now stands. Fletcher had purchased additional lands (future St Mary's lands) presumably to provide land for sporting activities, however, the depression of the 1890s led to the closure of his college and the sale of Lots 26 - 35 to Frank Grimley. When the Sisters made their purchase the land had largely been cleared and was characterised by open paddock with the exception of a number of mature eucalypts and \"The Rocks\". The following year on 24 June 1908, an additional  were purchased from Frank Grimley adding orchards and vegetable gardens to an already spacious landscape.\n\nParagraph 2: On 18 December 2012, it was announced that the Welsh Government was interested in buying the airport from its current owners. In 2012, the Airport faced sustained criticism from the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones. On 28 February 2012, Jones announced to the Welsh Assembly: \"We would like to see many routes emerging from Cardiff Airport, but the Airport must get its act together... Last week, I went to the Airport and the main entrance was shut. People could not go in through the main entrance; they had to go through the side entrance. It is important that the Airport puts itself in a position where it is attractive to new airlines, and, unfortunately, that is not the case at present.\" His criticism led to accusations that he was \"talking down\" Cardiff Airport whilst aviation industry professionals commented that he was unqualified to make such comments. However, Jones returned to this theme on 7 March 2012 saying, \"With the condition of the Airport at the moment I would not want to bring people in through Cardiff Airport because of the impression it would give of Wales...I have to say the time has come now for the owners of the Airport to decide to run the Airport properly or sell it.\"\n\nParagraph 3: The final plan was to land soldiers from navy ships on the Lebanese coast who would infiltrate into Beirut disguised as tourists, where they would be picked up by Mossad agents waiting for them with rented cars and driven to their targets. Some of the commandos were to be disguised as women (Barak was disguised as a brunette woman). This was at the suggestion of Elazar, who was concerned that a group of men moving through Beirut at midnight would raise suspicion. In addition to the assassination mission, four PLO facilities were to be attacked. To maintain the element of surprise, the apartments of the three targets would have to be breached before the other attacks could begin. Before the mission, the forces trained using similar apartments in northern Tel Aviv. They also practiced cross-dressing and walking around disguised as lovers. Meanwhile, Mossad agents in Beirut gathered additional intelligence for the raid. Nielsen selected the private beach of the Sands Hotel as the landing site since access was restricted to guests and it was close to the hotel's parking lot, where the commandos could be picked up by Mossad agents. Brigadier General Emmanuel Shaked, the commander of the IDF's infantry and paratrooper forces, was placed in overall command of the operation.\n\nParagraph 4: The ligand GABA is the endogenous compound that causes this receptor to open; once bound to GABA, the protein receptor changes conformation within the membrane, opening the pore in order to allow chloride anions (Cl\u2212) and, to a lesser extent, bicarbonate ions (HCO3\u2212) to pass down their electrochemical gradient. The binding site to GABA is about 80\u00c5 away from the narrowest part of the ion channel. Recent computational studies have suggested an allosteric mechanism whereby GABA binding leads to ion channel opening. Because the reversal potential for chloride in most mature neurons is close to or more negative than the resting membrane potential, activation of GABAA receptors tends to stabilize or hyperpolarise the resting potential, and can make it more difficult for excitatory neurotransmitters to depolarize the neuron and generate an action potential. The net effect therefore typically inhibitory, reducing the activity of the neuron, although depolarizing currents have been observed in response to GABA in immature neurons in early development. This effect during development is due to a modified Cl\u2212 gradient wherein the anions leave the cells through the GABAA receptors, since their intracellular chlorine concentration is higher than the extracellular. The difference in extracellular chlorine anion concentration is presumed to be due to the higher activity of chloride transporters, such as NKCC1, transporting chloride into cells which are present early in development, whereas, for instance, KCC2 transports chloride out cells and is the dominant factor in establishing the chloride gradient later in development. These depolarization events have shown to be key in neuronal development. In the mature neuron, the GABAA channel opens quickly and thus contributes to the early part of the inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP).\n\nParagraph 5: After resisting a shakedown from a group of corrupt police detectives, and then subsequently ditching their surveillance, Frank and his crew are involved in a large-scale diamond heist organized by Leo. All goes well with Frank's \"burn job\" and he is expecting the agreed-upon sum of $830,000 for the unmounted stones with a wholesale value $4 million. But when Frank returns from the job, Leo gives him less than $100,000. This is all that Frank will receive in cash according to Leo, who says he invested the rest of Frank's cut in shopping centers in Fort Worth, Texas and Dallas, Texas, an idea Frank had previously rejected. In addition, Leo sets up a Palm Beach score for Frank in six weeks without consulting him. Frank tells Leo that their deal is over and takes the cash as he leaves, demanding the rest of his money in 24 hours.\n\nParagraph 6: Sirens and Sailors newest EP entitled Wasteland was released on May 29, 2012, via Tragic Hero Records. Wasteland EP includes six tracks produced by Drew Fulk [At The Skylines] at Think Sound Studios in North Carolina. Regarding this album, vocalist Kyle Bihrle was quoted saying, \"We like to say that, \"there is a little something for everybody\" on this record.  Expect all your favorite aspects of our music to be included.  We bring the heavy, we bring the melodic, and we bring the ferocity.\" Sirens and Sailors set out on \"The Wasteland at Sea\" tour (June 2012) in support of this EP. This tour included support from Everyone Dies in Utah and Myka, Relocate. Sirens and Sailors supported headliner Belie My Burial, with additional support from Beheading of a King on the Northeast \"Pale Beyond Tour\" (July 2012). Sirens and Sailors provided direct support to The World We Knew on an East Coast tour (July\u2013August 2012) with additional support from King Conquer. Sirens and Sailors headlined \"The One The Rise Tour\"  (October 2012) with support from Us, From Outside and It Lives It Breathes. Sirens and Sailors supported headliner, Affiance with additional support from A Faylene Sky for a \"mini-tour\" (October\u2013November 2012) through New York, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Sirens and Sailors provided support to headliner, Everyone Dies in Utah with additional support from Affiance and Deception of a Ghost in late November 2012 through the Midwest and West Coast. To begin 2013, Sirens and Sailors provided support to The Air I Breathe on their farewell tour (February 2013), with additional support from For All I Am, Famous Last Words, and This Romantic Tragedy; touring throughout the East Coast and Texas. Sirens and Sailors provided direct support to in Dying Arms on their first headline tour (April\u2013May 2013); covering the East Coast through the Midwest. This tour also featured Mureau and Stand Your Ground. Vocalist Kyle Bihrle provided live guest vocals with Ice Nine Kills on the track \"So This Is My Future\" on May 25, 2013, at Water Street Music Hall in Rochester, New York. On June 4, 2013, the band announced their signing to Artery Recordings and Razor & Tie. On June 7, 2013, the band announced they would be providing support to August Burns Red, For Today, The Color Morale, My Children My Bride, and Fit For a King at the IMATTER Festival 2013; September 7, 2013, at Eldridge Park, Elmira, NY.\n\nParagraph 7: The company is engaged in the supply chain management in the consumer electronics sector, electronic manufacturing services (EMS), creation of technology products, as well as property and equity investments.

Wielding a huge silver revolver, he travels from town to town. He is initially discovered by Meryl and Milly, representatives from an insurance agency investigating claims made due to damages caused by the mysterious \"Humanoid Typhoon\". The pair find Vash while he is being chased by bandits who want to collect the bounty on \"The $$60,000,000,000 (sixty billion double dollar) Man\". He and his brother, Knives, were born on a colony ship that was part of a fleet sent to find and settle a new world in order to extend the human race. They were raised by Rem, who instilled upon Vash the philosophy that every being deserves life, and Vash now takes this to the extreme by always attempting to save everyone. Knives on the other hand, sickened by the actions of the humans around him, caused the fleet to crash, which killed Rem and many others. Vash has made it his purpose to hunt down and stop Knives from harming anyone else. Vash was forced to destroy the city of July during one of his confrontations with Knives, which haunts him considerably and starts his reputation.\n\nParagraph 9: The titular mecha of the series. It shows no visible weapons, as it was not built with the intention of being a Metal Fighter in the first place. Instead of that, it relies on a device able to focus a great amount of heat to Red Baron's fists, forearms and legs, giving it the power to pierce through his opponents with ease. It has two finishers attacks: The Electrigger (The Red Baron rises its arms in the air, then places them at the side of its waist as it adopts a Horseman Stance and starts building up power as it prepares to start the attack. Then the technique itself can take many forms: either a single but powerful punch, a barrage of punches, an uppercut when fighting airborne enemies or a forearm strike when equipped with the Forearm Blades, but no matter the variation, it always ends with the Red Baron ramming his arm through his foe and causing them to explode) and the Rolling Thunder (The Red Baron jumps high in the air and starts rolling forward very fast while descending while directing most of his power to either one of its legs, finishing the attack with an axe kick to the enemy's head, causing them to explode). The Red Baron is resistant, if not invulnerable, to fire and high temperatures, rising unscratched when entering in contact with lava. One of the most mysterious facts about the Red Baron is the possibility of it actually being sentient, for example in the first episode it reacts to Ken's presence and only allowing him to pilot it, as well as denying him of the right to pilot it when Ken was acting cocky after winning an important tournament. It also seems to enter some sort of Berserk mode when Ken's own life is at risk or when he has been knocked out while piloting Red Baron. During this mode the Red Baron seems to get a huge power boost and (apparently) even the power to regenerate its damaged part, seen in the fight with the Gold Baron where the Red Baron appears to regenerate a device that was ripped from its chest.\n\nParagraph 10: Like Cavite City (originally called Cavite La Punta) and Noveleta (La Tierra Alta), Imus used to be a part of Cavite el Viejo (now Kawit), whose parish church was built by the Jesuits during the administration of Archdiocese of Manila Archbishop Miguel Garcia Serrano, 1618\u20131629. For more than a century and a half the people of Imus had to endure walking or traveling  of dirt road to attend religious services or transact official business in the city proper. The difficulty of communication between Imus and Cavite el Viejo was a long-standing complaint of the Imuse\u00f1os until another religious order, the Augustinian Recollects, as a consequence of the British occupation of Manila in 1762, established a parish church in Imus, in what is now known as Bayang Luma.\n\nParagraph 11: \"Yolngu Boy is a sensitive but dramatic treatment of the search for identity in modern Australia by three indigenous boys. This is a long overdue film about what it means to be a young indigenous person in Australia today. I hope very many Australians go to see it\". Dr David Kemp, Federal Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs\"...probably the most important Australian film of the year...I wish I could compel every Australian to see it\". Peter Thompson, Sunday, Channel 9\"This is a terrific contribution to the reconciliation process...The film has great honesty, but will also provide greater understanding of indigenous spirituality and culture. There were some images in the film that will stay with me for some time\". Michael Gorton, Co-Chair, Australians for Reconciliation\"I could personally relate to it myself. The dream is stronger than the goal\". Michael Long, Essendon Football Club\"Yolngu Boy is a movie with heart and integrity, but is also insightful, original and intensely compelling\". The Hon Peter McGauran MP, Federal Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation\"Yolngu Boy is one of the most rewarding films that you are likely to see...This is truly a masterpiece of community spirit and a gift to the world. Don't miss this film, a remarkable insight into contemporary Australia. Five out of five\". James Brandis, WA Post\"The film, about three teenagers caught between the modern world and their traditional culture, is a visual feast\". FOCUS, autumn markets\"An edifying film that was both confronting and humbling \u2013 a presentation for all Australians to see\". The Hon. Philip Ruddock, Minister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs\"A really impressive film with incredible energy. I think it showed great insight into a culture that white Australians know nothing about\". Deb Cox, CoxKnight Productions, Creator SeaChange\"Yolngu Boy is realistic and, at times, confronting. It is also an original, beautiful and moving film. It should be seen by all Australians \u2013 because it gives us a deeper understanding of indigenous culture and experiences, while still telling a great story\". The Hon. Steve Bracks MP, Premier of Victoria.\"...this estimable fable for the 21st century deserves as wide an audience as possible. A moving drama about lives in the making and battles against the odds, it is also a compelling adventure yarn with a brain\". Tom Ryan, Sunday Age\"...such an impressive film...you're being presented with parts of Australian life you've never seen before...\" Margaret Pomeranz, SBS Movie ShowSoundtrack\n\nParagraph 12:  Kolkata Urban Agglomeration includes :  Kolkata district: Kolkata (M Corp.), Nadia district: Kalyani (M), Gayespur (M), North 24 Parganas district: Raigachhi (CT), Barasat (M), Madhyamgram (M), Kanchrapara (M),  Nanna (OG), Chakla (OG), Srotribati (OG), Jetia (CT), Halisahar (M), Balibhara (CT), Naihati (M), Noapara (P) (CT), Babanpur (CT), Teghari (CT), Bhatpara (M), Panpur (OG), Kaugachhi (CT), Garshyamnagar (CT), Garulia (M), Ichhapur Defence Estate (CT), North Barrackpur (M), Barrackpur Cantonment (CB), Barrackpur (M), Jafarpur (CT), Ruiya (CT), Titagarh (M), Khardaha (M), Bandipur (CT), Panihati (M), Muragachha (CT), New Barrackpur (M), Chandpur (CT), Talbandha (CT), Patulia (CT), Kamarhati (M), Baranagar (M), South Dum Dum (M), North Dum Dum (M), Dum Dum (M), Rajarhat-Gopalpur (M) [now merged with Bidhannagar (M Corp.)], Bidhannagar (M Corp.), Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (Salt Lake Sector V) (M), West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corp (New Town) (M),  Hooghly district: Dankuni (M Corp) Bansberia (M), Hugli-Chinsurah (M), Bara Khejuria (OG), Shankhanagar (CT),  Amodghata (CT),  Chak Banshberia (CT), Naldanga (CT), Kodalia (CT), Kulihanda (CT), Simla (CT), Dharmapur (CT), Bhadreswar (M), Champdani (M), Chandannagar (M Corp.), Baidyabati (M), Serampore (M), Rishra (M), Rishra (CT), Bamunari (CT), Dakshin Rajyadharpur (CT), Nabagram Colony (CT), Konnagar (M), Uttarpara Kotrung (M), Raghunathpur (PS-Dankuni) (CT), Kanaipur (CT), Keota (CT), Howrah district: Bally (M) [Now merged with Howrah (M Corp.)], Howrah (M Corp.), Bally (CT), Jagadishpur (CT), Chamrail (CT), Eksara (CT), Chakapara (CT), Khalia (CT), Bankra (CT), Nibra (CT), Mahiari (CT), Bipra Noapara (CT), Ankurhati (CT), Kantlia (CT), Salap (CT), Tentulkuli (CT), 83 Argari (CT), Andul (CT), Ramchandrapur (CT), Jhorhat (CT), Hatgachha (CT), Dhuilya (CT), Panchpara (CT), Podara (CT), Banupur (CT), Sankrail (CT), Manikpur (CT), Sarenga (CT), Raghudebbati (CT), Nalpur (CT), Uluberia (M), Chak Srikrishna (OG), Khalisani (CT), Uttar Pirpur (CT), Balarampota (CT), Santoshpur (CT), Domjur (CT), Dakshin Jhapardaha (CT), Makardaha (CT), Khantora (CT), Bhandardaha (CT), Kamranga (CT), Jaypur Bil (CT), South 24 Parganas district: Joka (CT), Chata Kalikapur (CT), Ganye Gangadharpur (CT), Rameswarpur (CT), Asuti (CT), Hanspukuria (CT), Kalua (CT), Ramchandrapur (CT), Samali (CT), Maheshtala (M), Uttar Raypur (CT), Balarampur (CT), Buita (CT), Benjanhari Acharial (CT), Abhirampur (CT), Nischintapur (CT), Birlapur (CT), Chak Kashipur (CT), Chak Alampur (CT), Bowali (CT), Dakshin Raypur (CT), Poali (CT), Pujali (M), Budge Budge (M), Daulatpur (CT), Bhasa (CT), Bishnupur (CT), Kanyanagar (CT), Nahazari (CT), Nadabhanga (CT), Kanganbaria (CT), Bora Gagangohalia (CT), Chanddandaha (CT), Barkalikapur (CT), Patharberia (CT), Ramkrishnapur (CT), Amtala (CT), Kriparampur (CT), Chak Enayetnagar (CT), Maricha (CT), Bhangar Raghunathpur (CT), Gobindapur (CT), Radhanagar (CT), Danga (CT), Ramchandrapur (CT), Bidyadharpur (CT), Kalikapur (CT), Chak Baria (CT), Sahebpur (CT), Rajpur Sonarpur (M), Petua (CT), Garia (CT), Panchghara (CT), Mallikpur (CT), Hariharpur (CT), Champahati (CT), Solgohalia (CT), Naridana (CT), Salipur (CT), Khodar Bazar (CT), Komarhat (CT), Baruipur (M), Raynagar (CT), Kalikapur Barasat (CT), Baharu (CT), Uttarparanij (CT), Alipur (CT), Uttar Durgapur (CT), Jaynagar Majilpur (M).\n\nParagraph 13: The three main drivers for the team, Andretti, Hunter-Reay, and Hinchcliffe, all returned for 2013. In addition, E. J. Viso was added as a fourth car for the season, in conjunction with HVM Racing. Rookie driver Carlos Mu\u00f1oz would also drive an entry for the team in the Indy 500. Mu\u00f1oz and Zach Veach would be the team's drivers in the lower level Indy Lights series. Andretti would also have entries in the Pro Mazda Championship and the U.S. F2000 National Championship, the feeder series to IndyCar (the \"Road to Indy\").  The season started strong as Hinchcliffe won the season's first race, the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, his first IndyCar Series victory. In the second race, the Grand Prix of Alabama, Hinchcliffe suffered a breakdown and would be stuck on the side for most of the race watching teammate Hunter-Reay go on to victory to make the team two for two. The streak broke in week three, with both Hinchcliffe and Hunter-Reay exiting the race early. High and low would go on to be a theme for the team that season. Hinchcliffe would go on to win two more races, but a variety of mechanical problems would see him finish the year eighth. Hunter-Reay would have a similar season, winning two races but finishing the season a disappointing seventh following his 2012 championship. Conversely, Andretti would stay near the top of the standings for most of the season after starting by finishing no worse than 7th in seven of his first eight races, but after two early third-place finishes, he would not see the podium the remainder of the year and finished the season in 5th place. Viso, meanwhile who came into the team with a reputation for being involved in collisions, showed flashes of success, including a fourth-place finish at Milwaukee, but had only two top-ten finishes, a fifth and a ninth, in his final eight races, before dropping out of the season finale stating he had food poisoning. He was replaced for the race by Carlos Mu\u00f1oz. Mu\u00f1oz provided a thrill for the team in the Indy 500, taking second place in his first-ever start in the IndyCar series.\n\nParagraph 14: In April 2008, private nurse Janet Ketring appears in Llanview, helping Lee Ramsey care for a bedridden and amnesiac Marty Saybrooke. Ramsey is killed and Todd Manning secretly takes custody of Marty, who all of Llanview believes had been killed in an explosion in December 2007. Todd coerces Janet to continue tending to Marty under his employ. For the sum of $1 million, Janet also agrees to keep Marty's existence a secret. Neither Marty nor Janet are aware that Todd had raped Marty over a decade before. Seeking absolution for his crimes against Marty at any cost, Todd lies about their relationship as well as the existence of Marty's son. During a conversation with Todd, Janet reveals that she is estranged from her loved ones and claims she is \"dead to them.\" Llanview Police Detective John McBain discovers that Janet is, in fact, Lee Halpern. He uses this information to try to pressure Janet into revealing that her mystery patient is, as he now suspects, the presumed-dead Marty. Janet is horrified to hear from John that Todd had raped Marty and is keeping her from her son. Janet confronts Todd, who also knows her true identity and threatens to expose her unless she continues to keep his secret. He soon forces her to assist him in his intended kidnapping of his unborn grandchild. Todd calls off the plan, but his mentally ill niece Jessica Buchanan switches her own stillborn baby girl with the new-born daughter of Todd's daughter Starr Manning. With Starr's baby believed dead, Janet leaves Llanview on November 11, 2008, but reappears on Renee Buchanan's doorstep on January 9, 2009, desperate for sanctuary. Janet fears prosecution and Todd's wrath, but soon agrees to cooperate with the authorities. Todd catches her wearing a wire, but Janet is kept in protective custody. Todd publishes an expos\u00e9 on Janet in his newspaper, The Sun, to sabotage her credibility before the upcoming trial. Terrified that one of the people she had conned will come after her, Janet escapes police custody. Todd discovers Janet stabbed to death on his living room floor on January 30, 2009. Believing that Todd is innocent but realizing that he would be blamed, T\u00e9a confesses to the police that she had stabbed Janet in selfdefense, and Janet's body is taken away. Powell Lord III later confesses to the murder, as part of his plan to punish anyone who has hurt Marty and punish Todd.\n\nParagraph 15: The outbreak of War put an end to his career in local government. In anticipation of a Soviet invasion and the consequent occupation of the Wilno region - moves which were the fulfillment of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Stanis\u0142aw made his way through the still autonomous Lithuania. He hoped to reach France from there, and join the fight against Germany. It was not easy despite the fact that he had a valid French visa. The Lithuanian Government, in an attempt to ingratiate themselves with the Nazi government, banned all young people from leaving the country. Everybody knew that young person would try to join the Polish Army which was just being formed in France, in order to continue fighting against Hitler. Using his quick wits and a false medical certificate of tuberculosis (given to him by a friendly doctor from Kaunas), he overcome many obstacles, travelling through Latvia, Estonia and Sweden. In November 1939 he arrived in France and on 18 December 1939 signed up as a soldier of the Polish Army. His army identity document bears the number 3138, and the date 30 December 1939. He served in the Arm\u00e9e Polonaise first as a lieutenant commanding a platoon of grenadiers, and then as an aide-de-camp (adjutant). Finally, he was promoted as Commander of the Headquarters of the 6th Regiment of the 2nd Division of Infantry. His division had a chance to fight the enemy, but after its defeat at Ma\u00eeche, the division was given orders to cross the border to Switzerland. Once there, the soldiers were sent to an internment camp. After only a week, Stanis\u0142aw Radziwon secretly left the camp for France in an attempt to reach Great Britain and pursue his fight against the Nazis. He vividly described his dramatic escapades and ordeals, in stories published in Wiadomo\u015bci (published in Scotland) [1]. After many ups and downs he reached Paris, where he hid in a convent. He was able to obtain forged French identity documents and bicycled all the way to the Pyrenees, helped on his way by friendly local people. There he met smuggler who had been recommended to him and was led by him through the mountains to the outskirts of San Sebastian in Spain. However, the Guardia Civil arrested and imprisoned him and later sent him by train to France again. He escaped from the train, only to be arrested by the Gestapo. Sentenced to death, he miraculously escaped with his life. Relentlessly, he forced his way to Spain again and then to Portugal, where in July 1941 he received his Polish passport from the Legacio da Polonia (Rua das Amoreiras 105 in Lisbon). The passport was issued by the Consular Section in Bern, Switzerland. On 5 August 1941 he received a British visa. The document declared: \u2018Permitted to land in the United Kingdom on condition that the holder reports at once to the Polish Army headquarters in the United Kingdom and is subject to such further conditions as the Secretary of State may at any time impose\u2019. In a secret British military operation he and other volunteers were then transported from the coast to a boat and then sailed to Gibraltar. He waited six weeks in Gibraltar and finally arrived in Great Britain on 17 October 1941. The next day he was officially drafted into the Army.  After lengthy training in England he was sent to Scotland, where in 1943 he joined the 2nd Infantry Battalion, commonly called the \u2018Tartan Lions\u2019.\n\nParagraph 16: At the start of World War I, the head office was temporarily relocated to Bordeaux, but returned to the capital in November 1914. Both shortly before and after the war, the CIC further strengthened its network outside of Paris by acquiring a 60% majority stake in the  in October 1913, a 11% stake in the  in May 1914, and a 22% stake in the  in April 1921. In 1919, the CIC also acquired a 29.5% stake in the  in Caen (est. 1913), and in November 1919 created a majority-owned subsidiary, the , whose head office was relocated to Strasbourg in March 1922. Also in November 1919, it took a 25% stake in the Banque Dupont in Valenciennes (est. 1819), and in 1920 a 33% stake in the Banque Scalbert in Lille (est. 1838). The CIC further developed this strategy of stake-building when financial stress hit several regional banks in subsequent years. It took a 33% stake in  in June 1924, a 20% stake in  (est. 1913) in December 1924, a 28% stake in  in September 1926, a 33% stake in  (BRO, est. 1913) in 1927, and a stake in  in 1930. In 1929, the CIC created a central body for its regional banks, the . By then, it was the fifth-largest French bank by assets, behind the Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris, and Banque Nationale de Cr\u00e9dit. The CIC's participation in bank restructurings in the early 1930s strengthened the , which renamed itself Cr\u00e9dit Industriel d'Alsace et de Lorraine (CIAL) in May 1931, and the . In June 1931 the CIC also created the , of which it owned 80% of equity, but sold it in 1937 to the . In March 1932, the CIC engineered the merger of its ,  and  to form the  (CIN), which also absorbed the  in March 1935. In August 1936, the CIC sold most of its majority stake in the .\n\nParagraph 17: These examples of applications took place during the 2018 Advanced Naval Technology exercises, in August at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport. The first example of unmanned underwater vehicles was displayed by Northrop Grumman with their air drop sonobuoy's from a fire scout aircraft. Throughout the demonstration the company used the: e Iver3-580 (Northrop Grumman AUV) to display their vehicles ability to sweep for mines, while also displaying their real-time target automated recognition system. Another company, Huntington Ingalls Industries, presented their version of an unmanned underwater vehicle named Proteus. The Proteus is a dual-mode undersea vehicle developed by Huntington and Battelle, the company during the presentation displayed their unmanned underwater vehicle capabilities by conducting a full-kill demonstration on sea bed warfare. During the demonstration the vehicle utilized a synthetic aperture sonar which was attached to both the port and starboard of the craft, which allowed the unmanned underwater vehicle to identify the targets placed underwater and to ultimately eliminate them. Ross Lindman (director of operations at the company's technical solution's fleet support group) stated that \"The big significance of this is that we ran the full kill chain\". \"We ran a shortened version of an actual mission. We didn\u2019t say, \u2018Well we\u2019re doing this part and you have to imagine this or that.\u2019 We ran the whole thing to illustrate a capability that can be used in the near term.\" The final demonstration for unmanned underwater vehicles was displayed by General Dynamics, the company showcased their cross-domain multi-platform UUV through a theater simulating warfare planning tool. Through the utilization of this simulation, they showed a Littoral combat ship along with two unmanned underwater vehicles. The goal of this exercise was to demonstrate the communication speed between the operator and the UUV. James Langevin, D-R.I., ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s subcommittee on emerging threats, stated in regard to this exercise \"What this is all driving to is for the warfare commander to be able to make the decisions that are based on what he thinks is high-confidence input quicker than his adversary can,\" he said. \"That\u2019s the goal \u2014 we want to be able to \u2026 let them make warfare-related decisions quicker than anybody else out there.\" These exercises were conducted to showcase the applications of unmanned underwater vehicles within the military community, along with the innovations each company created to better suite these specific mission types.\n\nParagraph 18: McMurray's entry into Cup racing did not go as planned. McMurray was scheduled to drive a limited schedule in a No. 42 Chip Ganassi Racing Dodge in 2002, in preparation for a full-time 2003 rookie of the year campaign in the No. 42 with new sponsor Texaco/Havoline. However, he was instead tapped as interim replacement for injured Ganassi Cup driver Sterling Marlin, who fractured a vertebra in a crash at Kansas Speedway. Thus, McMurray made his Cup debut in the No. 40 Coors Light Dodge at Talladega. One week later, at Charlotte, in just his second career NASCAR Winston Cup and first non-restrictor plate start, McMurray outraced the Joe Gibbs Racing Pontiacs of Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart to win the UAW-GM Quality 500. McMurray had been consistent the entire night, and led 96 of the final 100 laps to score the win. It is considered one of the biggest upsets in NASCAR history. This win set a modern-era record for fewest starts before a win (which has since been tied only by Trevor Bayne in the 2011 Daytona 500), and it was also the first time a driver won in their first start at a 1.5-mile track. McMurray drove for six of the remaining seven races, except for the Old Dominion 500 at Martinsville, with Mike Bliss driving as scheduled in the No. 40.\n\nParagraph 19: The following night, Hikage sees Aya suffering from a nightmare. He holds her to try and comfort her, but immediately hears screaming coming from the forest. He rushes to the source of the screaming only to find Taichi and one of the Takeda ninja he spoke with earlier dead, along with another badly injured Takeda ninja. A spider y\u014dma attacks, but Hikage uses shuriken to drive it off, seeing a brief, transparent vision of Marou in the y\u014dma's wake. Before dying, the injured ninja reveals that Marou is a \"child born of the ground\" and that everyone in the Takeda village knew about it, but never discussed it. Left with this mystery, Hikage confronts Aya with Taichi's death, only for her to deny it. When Aya goes to her house to store some water, she hears Ito's voice asking her to do her a favor that night. Hikage goes down to the riverbank to find that the bodies of Taichi and the dead ninja, along with the bloodstains and weapons, have disappeared without explanation. Hikage hears Aya singing unusually late that night and goes to investigate. He finds Aya being held in a different spider y\u014dma's mandibles and attacks it. It drops Aya, but soon runs away with Hikage in pursuit. He arrives at the temple and finds the priest from the waterfall standing before him on the path. He tells Hikage that he is erasing the villager's memories in order to ripen them for Kikuga no Miko's (the demon lord y\u014dma of the land) revival after revealing the fact that he was the spider yoma from before. On the verge of death from a short battle, the priest/y\u014dma warns Hikage about the suicide of the entire village should he die, which Hikage proceeds to kill him anyway. Aya wakes up and remembers how she got her scar, the priest's spell having worn off when he died. It was assumed that she drowned herself. Hikage finds a seemingly unconscious Ito and rushes to her aide. However, she wakes up and restrains Hikage but he was able to kill her also. Hikage enters the shrine and destroys the buddha statue to reveal an egg that he quickly cuts open. The egg opens to reveal Marou feasting on Taichi's severed head. A speechless Hikage approaches him, but Marou attacks him, causing the entire building to come crashing down. Outside, a fully dressed Marou walks away, giving the broken building a final glance before departing.\n\nParagraph 20: The region of Cuyo has an arid climate or a semi-arid climate with an average annual precipitation of about  that is generally unreliable from year to year. The region, which encompasses a wide range of latitudes combined with elevations ranging from 500 m to nearly 7,000 m means that it has a diverse range of different climates. In general, most of the region has a temperate climate with higher elevation valleys having a more milder climate. At the highest elevations (over 4,000 m), icy conditions persist year round.  The diurnal range is very large with very hot temperatures during the day followed by cold nights. Amongst all locations in Argentina, the region has the largest diurnal range in the country with areas in San Juan Province having a diurnal range exceeding . The Andes prevent rain\u2013bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean from coming in, while its latitude puts it in a band of the sub-tropical high pressure belt keeping this region dry. With very low humidity, abundant sunshine throughout the year, and a temperate climate, the region is suitable for wine production. Droughts are often frequent and prolonged. The Cuyo region is influenced by the subtropical, semi\u2013permanent South Atlantic anticyclone to the east in the Atlantic, the semi-permanent South Pacific anticyclone to the west of the Andes, the development of a low pressure system (\"Chaco low\") over northern Argentina and westerlies in the southern parts of the region. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer, when hot temperatures and high insolation lead to the development of a low pressure system (\"Chaco low\") situated over northern Argentina that interacts with the South Atlantic anticyclone to generate a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the region, favouring precipitation, which mostly occurs in the form of convective thunderstorms. More than 85% of the annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which represents the warm season. In contrast, the winter months are dry due to these systems weakening, and the lower insolation that weakens the Chaco low over northern Argentina. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. As such, most of Mendoza province and San Juan province receive the lowest annual precipitation with mean summer precipitation averaging less than  and in rare cases, no summer rainfall. Further eastwards in San Luis province, mean summer rainfall averages around  and can exceed  in some areas. Higher elevation locations receive precipitation in the form of snow during the winter months. In the Cuyo region, annual precipitation is highly variable from year to year and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4\u20135, 6\u20138, and 16\u201322 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic anticyclone are stronger, which causes more moisture towards this region while during the dry years, these winds are weaker.\n\nParagraph 21: After the outbreak of hostilities on 19 December 1946, the French Union forces had made significant progress by capturing the cities of Haiphong, Hanoi, L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, Cao B\u1eb1ng and most of the western and southern regions of Tonkin, which was the stronghold of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh movement. The reasons for the fast advance were the superior firepower, naval and air support of the French forces. The main force of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh was nearly surrounded by the French in the eastern part of Tonkin. There remained only a greater gap between the towns of Cao B\u1eb1ng in the north and Y\u00ean B\u00e1i in the south. During April 1947 Ho Chi Minh made a last attempt to achieve a ceasefire and to continue the independence negotiations with the French government from 1946. The French only demanded his surrender, because the position of the Vietnamese forces seemed to be desperate. On 26 April, Ho refused the French, offering: \"In the French Union is no place for cowards. I would be one, if I would accept.\" During the spring and the summer, the French attacked the bases of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh troops in Tonkin but could not bring them to battle; the Vi\u1ec7t Minh returned when the French moved on.\n\nParagraph 22: One of the Kirunda textile factories where Mr. Batte, Sanyu's dad works as a foreman, gets damaged in a fire. Nalweyiso, Sanyu's step-mum, forces her to sign a contract she hasn't read through.This was a contract to work for the Kirundas as a maid.

While the rest of the maids, Karungi, Nanziri & Kakai enjoy Francis Kirunda's company, Sanyu doubts he's a good husband as she had earlier seen him in the company of Patience who Sanyu suspects to be his mistress. This is later proven right when Francis goes to meet Patience in a hotel room who then threatens to expose the truth to the media .To stop this, Francis takes her home which annoys Linda and she fights with Patience causing her to stress out and leads her into drinking. However, Sanyu stops her from consuming alcohol by advising her to draw and take orange juice instead. Patience lies about carrying Francis's baby but Sanyu overhears her talking to a doctor to forge scans.

The number of family estates, starting with Gd\u00f3w and Szczyrzyca which the family also possessed in the 13th century, increased significantly. In the 17th and 18th centuries they were located in Lubomierz, Nowy Wi\u015bnicz, Bochnia, Wieliczka, \u0141a\u0144cut, Baran\u00f3w Sandomierski, Pu\u0142awy, Rzesz\u00f3w, R\u00f3wne, Tarn\u00f3w, Jaros\u0142aw, Przeworsk, and Janowiec upon the Vistula, among others. To this day, the castle in Nowy Wi\u015bnicz has been the property of the Family Association of the Princes Lubomirski. Many estates were located in the territories of the largest Polish cities: Warsaw (e.g. Mokot\u00f3w, Ujazd\u00f3w, Czerniak\u00f3w), Krak\u00f3w (Wola Justowska, Kamienica Pod Baranami), Rzesz\u00f3w (castle), Sandomierz, and Lvov. Maintaining foreign residences in Drezno, Vienna, and Paris enhanced family prestige. The members of the family were referred to as \"the owners of the bank of the Dnieper River\" because many of their estates were located in what is now Ukraine and Slovakia. The Lubomirski family enjoyed political, military, and economic influence, which was concentrated in the provinces of Krak\u00f3w, Sandomierz, Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w, and Ruthenia, to eventually cover the whole area of the Commonwealth of the Two Nations. They kept this state of ownership until the collapse of the Polish state, when they were deprived of many estates as a result of penalties for pro-independence activities.\n\nParagraph 24: Bellamy is primarily a rock 'n' roll and country-and-western singer. In the late 1950s, he played in a band and later a duo with Alan Klein. Bellamy decided to audition for a group formed by Joe Meek that was advertised in the music press. It was this audition that determined that Bellamy would play rhythm guitar for the Tornados, who were firstly a session band for Meek. However, the group reached new heights with their instrumental \"Telstar\", which reached number one all over the world and was the first British rock song to be a number-one single in the United States. Bellamy wrote one of The Tornados' tracks, \"Ridin' the Wind\", which also was a hit single in the USA.\n\nParagraph 25: On November 10 in Korakuen Hall, Nakamura was renamed to Ben-K, based on the legend of 12th century warrior monk Sait\u014d Musashib\u014d Benkei. In his first match as Ben-K, he and Shun Watanabe (now known as Shun Skywalker) lost to Jimmy Susumu and Jimmy Kagetora. On December 25 at Final Gate 2016, he got his first title shot in Dragon Gate, pairing up with Kotoka and Masato Yoshino to challenge for the Open the Triangle Gate Championship in a three-way match won by the Jimmyz (Jimmy Kanda, Jimmy Susumu and Ryo \"Jimmy\" Saito). In early 2017, Naruki Doi and Big R Shimizu made a call to the entire roster, looking for a third man to help them challenge for the Triangle Gate belts. Ben accepted, and on March 20, they defeated VerserK (Shingo Takagi, T-Hawk and \"brother\" Yasshi) to win the vacant titles. On May 4, Doi and Yoshino announced the formation of their new stable, known as \"MaxiMuM\", with Kotoka, Big R Shimizu and Ben-K announced as the members, along with themselves. During May, Ben-K took part in his first King of Gate tournament, but struggled greatly, earning just one win over Yosuke\u2665Santa Maria. On July 1, MaxiMuM dropped the Triangle Gate titles to VerserK (Shingo Takagi, El Lindaman and Takashi Yoshida). On November 3 at the Gate of Destiny, Ben-K and Big R Shimizu, who called themselves \"Big Ben\", unsuccessfully challenged Cima and Dragon Kid for the Open the Twin Gate Championship. On February 11, 2018, he received a non-title singles match against then Open the Dream Gate Champion Masaaki Mochizuki, in which he dominated and beat the champion in just over two minutes. After the match, he challenged Mochizuki to a match for the Dream Gate title, which was accepted and set up for March 4 at Champion Gate in Osaka. After 23 minutes, Ben-K lost a hard-fought bout by referee's decision and failed to capture the title. On May 6 at Dead or Alive, Big Ben won the Twin Gate championships, defeating Antias (Eita and T-Hawk). Ben-K once again entered the King of Gate tournament in 2018 and fared much better than the previous year. He earned 5 points, however, a loss to Yamato eliminated him. On July 22 at Kobe World Pro Wrestling Festival, Big Ben lost the Twin Gate titles to Tribe Vanguard (BxB Hulk and Yamato) and not long after Big R Shimizu turned his back on MaxiMuM and joined heel unit Antias, effectively breaking up Big Ben. However, the break-up would not last long, as on September 6 in Korakuen, Ben-K himself turned heel for the first time in his career, betraying MaxiMuM to join Antias with Big R.\n\nParagraph 26: Also known as \"Fault\" or \"Defect\". When held steady or flashing, it means that a trouble condition exists on the panel.  Trouble conditions are often activated by a contaminated smoke detector or an electrical problem within the system.  Trouble conditions are also activated by a zone being disabled, a circuit or NAC being disabled, low power on the backup battery, disabling of a notification appliance, ground faults, or short or open circuits.  Usually the alarm panel's sounder will activate if a trouble condition exists, though older systems would sometimes activate a bell or other audible signal connected to the panel.  In a trouble condition, the panel displays the zone or devices causing the condition. Usually, the \"Trouble\" indicator goes out automatically when the situation causing the trouble condition is rectified; however in some systems the panel must be manually reset to clear the trouble alarm. Some panels have more specific indicators such as \"Trouble-PSU\" which shows when the panel itself is compromised, and \"Trouble-Bell\" or \"NAC Trouble\" (\"Sounder Fault\" on UK panels) which shows that the notification appliances are not functioning or connected correctly. On most panels, an acknowledge button is pressed to turn off the panel's sounder.\n\nParagraph 27: The first minister was appointed in 1702 was Joseph Twemlow, who was born in Cheshire in 1673. The first record of his pastorate was to baptize Hannah Harper on 7 June 1702. He also opened a school in his own house in 1715 for teaching poor children of Protestant Dissenters in the Dursley area in Water Street, where it provided education for local children for the next hundred and seventy two years. After this it became the Twemlow Trust, giving grants to children and young people to help with their education and training. Retiring in 1738 and died on 22 August 1740 aged 67 and is buried in the churchyard. Nicholas Martyn became the next pastor in 1738, and received the annual sum of \u00a340. In 1745, he was succeeded by Hornblower, who was ordained in 1745 and whose ministry ended in 1766. The next minister was Rev Perry Bartlett from 1767. Bartlett stayed until 1771 when he was succeeded by William Billingsley in 1772, but Billingsley died of tuberculosis in 1776. Rev John Thomas became pastor and served for forty years. In 1806, he married Miss Mary Dyer of Cromhall. Thomas died in 1816 and his wife in 1840. Rev Thomas Griffiths succeeded Thomas and oversaw the completion of the renovation and remodelling of the chapel in June 1818. Rev C. Thomas, who had been pastor of North Nibley Tabernacle, succeeded Griffiths and  was joined in the pastorate by Andrew Gazard in 1842. Thomas died in 1861, and Gazard continued as pastor and bought the land for the Quarry Independent Chapel at the cost of \u00a314 and oversaw the building being built for \u00a3130 and opened in 1852. Gazard died on 22 August 1869, and he was succeeded by Rev James Williams in 1871. Williams stayed in ministry for twenty-one years, during which time a new Sweetland organ from Bath was installed at the cost of \u00a3200 in 1881. He resigned his pastorate in 1893. In 1894, Rev David Truss of the New Metropolitan Tabernacle, London, became pastor and lived in the old Manse in Lower Cam. He attended the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the new church classrooms of that year; these classrooms were opened on May Day 1895. On 28 May 1905, Truss ended his time as pastor. Owen Griffiths became pastor in March 1907, encouraging the membership to sign the Temperance Book and take \"The Pledge\" to abstain from all intoxicating drinks. He resigned his pastorate in 1919.\n\nParagraph 28: Djedefhor enters the palace and goes immediately to his father, king Khufu. The prince says: \u201cMay thy majesty live, be blessed and being prosperous! I have brought Djedi to you!\u201d Khufu replies: \u201cGo and bring him to me!\u201d Then Khufu takes place in the royal audience-hall. The Pharaoh receives Djedi with the words: \u201cWhat is it, Djedi, this denying to have seen you ever before?\u201d Djedi answers: \u201cOh sovereign, my lord! Only the one who is summoned is one who will come. I was summoned, and now see, oh sovereign, my lord, I have come.\u201d The pharaoh continues: \u201cIs it true, this talk-about that you could mend a severed head?\u201d Djedi says: \u201cYes, oh sovereign, my lord. May you live, be blessed and prosperous. I know how to do that.\u201d Khufu replies: \u201cMay a prisoner, who is jailed, be brought to me, so that his execution may be enforced.\u201d. Djedi refuses with the words: \u201cNot to make a human suffer, oh sovereign, my lord! May you live, be blessed and prosperous. You see, it was never allowed to do something like that on the noble flock.\u201d Djedi chooses three animals instead - first a goose. He decapitates the goose and places her head at the eastern side of the audience hall, the body at the western side. Then Djedi utters a secret spell and the head of the goose stands up, starting to waddle. Then the body of the goose stands up and waddles, too. Both body-parts move into equal directions, then melt together. The resurrected goose now leaves the hall cackling. The same performance is done with an undefined water bird and a bull. Both animals are brought successfully back to life, too. Now the king says: \u201cIt is said that you know the number of Iput inside the wenet-sanctuary of Thoth. Now?\u201d Djedi replies: \u201cMay you be praised, oh sovereign, my lord! I don't know their number. But I know where they can be found.\u201d Khufu asks: \u201cWhere is it?\u201d Djedi answers: \u201cThere is a box of scrolls, made of flint, which is stored in a room called \u2018archive\u2019 at Heliopolis.\u201d The king orders: \u201cTake that box!\u201d Djedi replies: \u201cMay your highness be prosperous and blessed, I'm not the one who can bring it to you.\u201d Khufu asks: \u201cWho may be the one who could bring it to me?\u201d Djedi answers: \u201cThe eldest of the three children in the womb of Rededjet, he will bring it to you.\u201d The king says: \u201cI really wish all these things you say. Who is it, this Rededjet?\u201d Djedi replies: \u201cIt's the wife of a wab-priest of the god Ra, lord of Sachebu. The god has adumbrated, that the eldest of the three shall worship as a high priest of Heliopolis over the whole realm.\u201d The king's mood becomes grim after this. Djedi asks: \u201cWhat is that heart of thine, oh sovereign, my lord, becoming so sad! Is it because of the children I have adumbrated? First your son, then his son and then one of them.\u201d Khufu replies: \u201cWhen will this Rededjet give birth?\u201d Djedi says: \u201cIt will happen during the first month of the peret-season, on the fifteenth day.\u2033 Khufu becomes indignant: \u201cBut it's when the canal-of-two-Mugilidae is cut off!? I would even work with my very own hands to enter them! And then I will visit that temple of Ra, lord of Sachebu.\u201d And Djedi says: \u201cThen I will make the waters at the fordable spots of the canal-of-two-Mugilidae become four cubits in height for you.\u201d Khufu stands up and orders: \u201cHave Djedi assigned to a place within the palace of my son Djedefhor where he shall live from now on. His daily gainings be 1000 loaves of bread, 100 jars of beer, one neat and 100 bundles of field garlic.\u201d And all things are done as ordered.\n\nParagraph 29: Three women fight against rules; Claire's struggle with alcohol and her fragile consistency, Bridget's courage (abused by Claire's fearsome husband once) being a prostitute and face the sexual harassment of the dirty and dominant Sheriff Jake and finally Maxine with her courage and strong character in several memorial scenes; for example: Threatening Jake with death if necessary in order to stop the cruel execution of her husband, do the same with \"The Kid\" when he tries to steal a coin and when finding the kidnapped widows by the corrupt \"Pinkerton\" cowboys, rescue a poor wounded Claire (whipped by John and tortured with thermal water by David), neutralize the blond cowboy John with one shot after giving him a chance to regret and force the other cowboy David to disrobe, strip and disappear and threaten to kill him if he doesn't what Mrs. Thornton says: Flee embarrassed totally naked into the desert and hiding amongst rocks in the night (who desperately meets the preacher and his group of Mexican partners; Roberto and Segundo, the next day and after making fun of him, is killed in cold blood by the Hangman in a single shoot). Claire recovers from her injuries and together the three women set off for Jerico again when they met \"The Kid\" who guides them to a cave and steals their expensive horse. These women find refuge in the tavern of a dear friend of Bridget's (Madame Dubois) until they are found by Jake who offers them a deal in search of the money. Claire escapes at dawn while Maxine and Bridget go looking for her, find her, and they are helped by \"The Stranger\" who turns out to be just another \"Thornton\" in search of fortune. The women finally face the powerful in a final battle in which slow characters do not survive in the hot desert climate, as Roberto, who is mortally wounded by The Preacher's men and his brother-in-law (Segundo) who is neutralized by Claire while trying to kidnap her and Bridget. Women face horrible enemies to defeat especially against rivals as dashing as the old preacher or hangman; so bloody and wicked as to enjoy the sorrows of others, betray, kill and humiliate one of the \"Pinkerton\" cowboys leaving his naked body (David) ready for coyotes in the desert afternoon, beat \"The Stranger\" in a ramshackle cabin being challenged, use the God's word at his convenience, publicly make fun of \"The Thornton\" and torture them, intimidate the widows, retain Maxine (who defends herself and confronts him with an iron weapon) neutralize with a lethal shot the banker Van Damn (who throughout history is seen suffering the loss of his beloved Greta and thirsty for revenge and money) after confessing that he buried Greta with the three \"Thornton\" 'Bandidos ' in a dirty cave, to be finally neutralized by the wild Bridget.\n\nParagraph 30: Latter Day Saint scripture teaches that a person may also be called through their lineage, so that they have a legal right to a priesthood office.  The Doctrine and Covenants (D&C) teaches that descendants of Aaron have legal right to the priesthood: \"And if they be literal descendants of Aaron, they have a legal right to the bishopric, if they are the firstborn among the sons of Aaron.\"  In a revelation recorded by Joseph Smith,  recorded in the D&C, he was promised his lineage would have the priesthood: \"Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers\u2014For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God\u2014Therefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.\"", "answers": ["Paragraph 12"], "pred": "1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,", "length": 10027, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6c982433659ce5f5ab0aed1ad2f7aaab98da81d6f2c884f7"}
