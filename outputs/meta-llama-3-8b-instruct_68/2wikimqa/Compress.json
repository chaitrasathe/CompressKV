{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nWaldrada of Lotharingia\nWaldrada was the mistress, and later the wife, of Lothair II of Lotharingia.\n\nBiography\nWaldrada's family origin is uncertain. The prolific 19th-century French writer Baron Ernouf suggested that Waldrada was of noble Gallo-Roman descent, sister of Thietgaud, the bishop of Trier, and niece of Gunther, archbishop of Cologne. However, these suggestions are not supported by any evidence, and more recent studies have instead suggested she was of relatively undistinguished social origins, though still from an aristocratic milieu.\nThe Vita Sancti Deicoli states that Waldrada was related to Eberhard II, Count of Nordgau (included Strasbourg) and the family of Etichonids, though this is a late 10th-century source and so may not be entirely reliable on this question.In 855 the Carolingian king Lothar II married Teutberga, a Carolingian aristocrat and the daughter of Bosonid Boso the Elder. The marriage was arranged by Lothar's father Lothar I for political reasons. It is very probable that Waldrada was already Lothar II's mistress at this time.Teutberga was allegedly not capable of bearing children and Lothar's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain an annulment of their marriage, and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavour. Lothair, whose desire for annulment was arguably prompted by his affection for Waldrada, put away Teutberga. However, Hucbert took up arms on his sister's behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858. Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother, Emperor Louis II, by a cession of lands and obtained the consent of the local clergy to the annulment and to his marriage with Waldrada, which took place in 862. However, Pope Nicholas I was suspicious of this and sent legates to investigate at the Council of Metz in 863. The Council found in favour of Lothair's divorce, which led to rumours that the papal legates may have bribed and thus meant that Nicholas order Lothair to take Teutberga back or face excommunication. \nWith the support of Charles the Bald and Louis the German, Teutberga appealed the annulment to Pope Nicholas. Nicholas refused to recognize the annulment and excommunicated Waldrada in 866, forcing Lothair to abandon Waldrada in favour of Teutberga. Lothair accepted this begrudgingly for a time, but shortly afterward at the end of 867 Pope Nicholas I died. Thus, Lothair began to seek the permission of the newly appointed Pope Adrian II to again put Teutberga aside and marry Waldrada, riding to Rome to speak with him on the matter in 869. However, on his way home, Lothair died.\n\nChildren\nWaldrada and Lothair II had some sons and probably three daughters, all of whom were declared illegitimate:\n\nHugh (c. 855\u2013895), Duke of Alsace (867\u2013885)\nGisela (c. 865\u2013908), who in 883 married Godfrey, the Viking leader ruling in Frisia, who was murdered in 885\nBertha (c. 863\u2013925), who married Theobald of Arles (c. 854\u2013895), count of Arles, nephew of Teutberga. They had two sons, Hugh of Italy and Boso of Tuscany. After Theobald's death, between 895 and 898 she married Adalbert II of Tuscany (c. 875\u2013915) They had at least three children: Guy, who succeeded his father as count and duke of Lucca and margrave of Tuscany, Lambert succeeded his brother in 929, but lost the titles in 931 to his half-brother Boso of Tuscany, and Ermengard.\nErmengarde (d. 90?)\nOdo (d. c.879)\nPassage 2:\nFrancis I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi\nFrancis I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi (February 24, 1645, Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, Transylvania \u2013 July 8, 1676, Zbor\u00f3, Royal Hungary) was a Hungarian aristocrat, elected prince of Transylvania and father of Hungarian national hero Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II.Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was the son of George R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II, prince of Transylvania, and Sophia B\u00e1thory. He was elected prince by the Transylvanian Diet in 1652, during his father's life. However, because of the disastrous Polish campaign of 1657 and its consequences, the Ottoman Empire removed his father from the throne in 1660, and prohibited any R\u00e1k\u00f3czi to ascend the Transylvanian throne. This left Francis unable to come by his father's legacy; he therefore withdrew to his estates in Royal Hungary.\nNotably, the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi family was Calvinist, and they were staunch supporters of the Reformed Church in Hungary. However, Francis' mother, Sophia B\u00e1thory, had converted to Calvinism merely for the sake of her marriage. After her husband's death, she returned to Catholicism and supported the Counter Reformation. Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi also became a Catholic, thus acquiring favour with the Catholic Habsburg Court. His mother converted him to Catholicism. He was made a count in 1664.\nIn 1666 Francis married Jelena Zrinska (Hungarian: Zr\u00ednyi Ilona), a Croatian countess, and joined the Wessel\u00e9nyi conspiracy (Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy in Croatia), one leader of which was Jelena's father, Petar Zrinski (Hungarian: Zr\u00ednyi P\u00e9ter). Francis soon became the leader of the conspiracy, and, as a culmination of their anti-Habsburg stratagems, started an armed uprising of nobles in Upper Hungary, while the other conspirators were supposed to start the fight in Croatia. Due to poor organization and discord between the conspirators, however, the Austrian authorities were well informed; they quickly suppressed the Croatian branch of the revolt.\nWhen R\u00e1k\u00f3czi learned that Petar Zrinski had been captured by the Austrians, he laid down his arms and applied for mercy. All other leaders of the conspiracy were executed for high treason; R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, due to his mother's intervention, and for a ransom of 300,000 forints and several castles, was pardoned.\n\nIssue\nFrancis I had three  children:\n\nGy\u00f6rgy (1667)\nJulianna Borb\u00e1la (1672\u20131717), married Count Ferdinand Gobert von Aspremont-Lynden (1643-1708)\nFrancis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II (1676\u20131735)Francis II was born only three months before his father's death. He led a rebellion against Austrian rule (R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence) and died in exile.\nPassage 3:\nMary Fiennes (lady-in-waiting)\nMary Fiennes (1495\u20131531) was an English courtier. She was the wife of Henry Norris. Norris was executed for treason as one of the alleged lovers of her cousin, Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII of England. Mary lived for six years at the French court as a Maid of Honour to queens consort Mary Tudor, wife of Louis XII; and Claude of France, wife of Francis I.\n\nFamily and early years\nMary was born at Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex in 1495, the only daughter of Thomas Fiennes, 8th Baron Dacre and Anne Bourchier. By both her father and mother she was descended from Edward III. She had two younger brothers, Sir Thomas and John. Her mother was an elder half-sister of Elizabeth Howard and Lord Edmund Howard, making queen consorts Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard a cousin of Mary. Her paternal grandmother, Alice FitzHugh, was sister to Elizabeth FitzHugh, grandmother of Catherine Parr, making her cousin to yet another queen consort of Henry VIII.\nIn 1514, Mary was appointed a Maid of Honour to Princess Mary Tudor and accompanied her to France when the latter married King Louis XII of France; afterwards she served in the capacity to Queen Mary's successor, Queen Claude, consort of the new king Francis I of France. Among her fellow Maids of Honour were her cousins, Mary (a mistress of Henry VIII) and Anne Boleyn.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1520 upon her return to England, she married the courtier, Henry Norreys (1491 \u2013 17 May 1536) of Yattendon in Berkshire, whom she had met that same year at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in France.\nNorris served King Henry VIII of England as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and was held in high favour by the King. He was later appointed Groom of the Stool and continued to enjoy the King's favour. According to biographer Eric Ives, Norris was \"perhaps the nearest thing Henry had to a friend.\" Norris had control of King Henry's Privy chamber.\nHenry and Mary had three children:\nEdward Norris (died 1529)\nHenry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys (c.\u20091525 \u2013 1601), married Margaret Williams of Rycote, by whom he had issue.\nMary Norris, married firstly Sir George Carew, and secondly Sir Arthur Champernowne, by whom she had issue.\n\nDeath\nMary died in 1531, a year after her mother. Five years later her husband was attainted and executed for treason as one of the five alleged lovers of her cousin Queen Anne Boleyn, who herself was beheaded at the Tower of London on 19 May 1536.\nTheir four orphaned children were raised by Norris's brother Sir John Norris.\n\nAncestry\nPassage 4:\nAgatha (wife of Samuel of Bulgaria)\nAgatha (Bulgarian: \u0410\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430, Greek: \u0386\u03b3\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7; fl.\u2009late 10th century) was the wife of Emperor Samuel of Bulgaria.\n\nBiography\nAccording to a later addition to the history of the late-11th-century Byzantine historian John Skylitzes, Agatha was a captive from Larissa, and the daughter of the magnate of Dyrrhachium, John Chryselios. Skylitzes explicitly refers to her as the mother of Samuel's heir Gavril Radomir, which means that she was probably Samuel's wife. On the other hand, Skylitzes later mentions that Gavril Radomir himself also took a beautiful captive, named Irene, from Larissa as his wife. According to the editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit, this may have been a source of confusion for a later copyist, and Agatha's real origin was not Larissa, but Dyrrhachium. According to the same work, it is likely that she had died by ca. 998, when her father surrendered Dyrrhachium to the Byzantine emperor Basil II.Only two of Samuel's and Agatha's children are definitely known by name: Gavril Radomir and Miroslava. Two further, unnamed, daughters are mentioned in 1018, while Samuel is also recorded as having had a bastard son.Agatha is one of the central characters in Dimitar Talev's novel Samuil.\nPassage 5:\nEmpress Sh\u014dken\nEmpress Dowager Sh\u014dken (\u662d\u61b2\u7687\u592a\u540e, Sh\u014dken-k\u014dtaig\u014d, 9 May 1849 \u2013 9 April 1914), born Masako Ichij\u014d (\u4e00\u6761\u52dd\u5b50, Ichij\u014d Masako), was the wife of Emperor Meiji of Japan. She is also known under the technically incorrect name Empress Sh\u014dken (\u662d\u61b2\u7687\u540e, Sh\u014dken-k\u014dg\u014d). She was one of the founders of the Japanese Red Cross Society, whose charity work was known throughout the First Sino-Japanese War.\n\nEarly life\nLady Masako Ichij\u014d was born on 9 May 1849, in Heian-ky\u014d, Japan. She was the third daughter of Tadayoshi Ichij\u014d, former Minister of the Left and head of the Fujiwara clan's Ichij\u014d branch. Her adoptive mother was one of Prince Fushimi Kuniie's daughters, but her biological mother was Tamiko Niihata, the daughter of a doctor from the Ichij\u014d family. Unusually for the time, she had been vaccinated against smallpox. As a child, Masako was somewhat of a prodigy: she was able to read poetry from the Kokin Wakash\u016b by the age of 4 and had composed some waka verses of her own by the age of 5. By age seven, she was able to read some texts in classical Chinese with some assistance and was studying Japanese calligraphy. By the age of 12, she had studied the koto and was fond of Noh drama. She excelled in the studies of finances, ikebana and Japanese tea ceremony.The major obstacle to Lady Masako's eligibility to become empress consort was the fact that she was 3 years older than Emperor Meiji, but this issue was resolved by changing her official birth date from 1849 to 1850. They became engaged on 2 September 1867, when she adopted the given name Haruko (\u7f8e\u5b50), which was intended to reflect her \nserene beauty and diminutive size.\nThe Tokugawa Bakufu promised 15,000 ry\u014d in gold for the wedding and assigned her an annual income of 500 koku, but as the Meiji Restoration occurred before the wedding could be completed, the promised amounts were never delivered. The wedding was delayed partly due to periods of mourning for Emperor K\u014dmei,  for her brother Saneyoshi, and the political disturbances around Kyoto between 1867 and 1868.\n\nEmpress of Japan\nLady Haruko and Emperor Meiji's wedding was finally officially celebrated on 11 January 1869. She was the first imperial consort to receive the title of both ny\u014dg\u014d and of k\u014dg\u014d (literally, the emperor's wife, translated as \"empress consort\"), in several hundred years. However, it soon became clear that she was unable to bear children. Emperor Meiji already had 12 children by 5 concubines, though: as custom in Japanese monarchy, Empress Haruko adopted Yoshihito, her husband's eldest son by Lady Yanagihara Naruko, who became Crown Prince. On 8 November 1869, the Imperial House departed from Kyoto for the new capital of Tokyo. In a break from tradition, Emperor Meiji insisted that the Empress and the senior ladies-in-waiting should attend the educational lectures given to the Emperor on a regular basis about national conditions and developments in foreign nations.\n\nInfluence\nOn 30 July 1886, Empress Haruko attended the Peeresses School's graduation ceremony in Western clothing. On 10 August, the imperial couple received foreign guests in Western clothing for the first time when hosting a Western Music concert.From this point onward, the Empress' entourage wore only Western-style clothes in public, to the point that in January 1887 \nEmpress Haruko issued a memorandum on the subject: traditional Japanese dress was not only unsuited to modern life, but Western-style dress was closer than the kimono to clothes worn by Japanese women in ancient times.In the diplomatic field, Empress Haruko hosted the wife of former US President Ulysses S. Grant during his visit to Japan. She was also present for her husband's meetings with Hawaiian King Kal\u0101kaua in 1881. Later that same year, she helped host the visit of the sons of future British King Edward VII: Princes Albert Victor and George (future George V), who presented her with a pair of pet wallabies from Australia.On  26 November 1886, Empress Haruko accompanied her husband to Yokosuka, Kanagawa to observe the new Imperial Japanese Navy cruisers Naniwa and Takachiho firing torpedoes and performing other maneuvers. From 1887, the Empress was often at the Emperor's side in official visits to army maneuvers. When Emperor Meiji fell ill in 1888, Empress Haruko took his place in welcoming envoys from Siam, launching warships and visiting Tokyo Imperial University. In 1889, Empress Haruko accompanied Emperor Meiji on his official visit to Nagoya and Kyoto. While he continued on to visit naval bases at Kure and Sasebo, she went to Nara to worship at the principal Shinto shrines.Known throughout her tenure for her support of charity work and women's education during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395), Empress Haruko worked for the establishment of the Japanese Red Cross Society. She participated in the organization's administration, especially in their peacetime activities in which she created a money fund for the International Red Cross. Renamed \"The Empress Sh\u014dken Fund\", it is presently used for international welfare activities. After Emperor Meiji moved his military headquarters from Tokyo to Hiroshima to be closer to the lines of communications with his troops, Empress Haruko joined her husband in March 1895. While in Hiroshima, she insisted on visiting hospitals full of wounded soldiers every other day of her stay.\n\nDeath\nAfter Emperor Meiji's death in 1912, Empress Haruko was granted the title Empress Dowager (\u7687\u592a\u540e, K\u014dtaig\u014d) by her adoptive son, Emperor Taish\u014d. She died in 1914 at the Imperial Villa in Numazu, Shizuoka and was buried in the East Mound of the Fushimi Momoyama Ryo in Fushimi, Kyoto, next to her husband. Her soul was enshrined in Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. On 9 May 1914, she received the posthumous name Sh\u014dken K\u014dtaig\u014d (\u662d\u61b2\u7687\u592a\u540e). Her railway-carriage can be seen today in the Meiji Mura Museum, in Inuyama, Aichi prefecture.\n\nHonours\nNational\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Precious Crown, 1 November 1888\n\nForeign\nShe received the following orders and decorations:\n Russian Empire: Grand Cross of the Order of St. Catherine, 13 December 1887\n Spain: Dame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa, 29 November 1889\n Siam: Dame of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri, 12 October 1899\n German Empire: Dame of the Order of Louise, 1st Class, 19 May 1903\n Kingdom of Bavaria: Dame of Honour of the Order of Theresa, 29 February 1904\n Korean Empire: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Auspicious Phoenix, 27 July 1908\n\nAncestry\nSee also\nEmpress of Japan\n\u014cmiya Palace\n\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nEuno\u00eb (wife of Bogudes)\nEuno\u00eb Maura was the wife of Bogudes, King of Western Mauretania. Her name has also been spelled Euries or Euryes or Eunoa.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nEuno\u00eb Maura was thought to be descended from Berbers, but her name is Greek so it appears she might have been from there or had Greek ancestry. She was likely of very high status, as she is mentioned by historian Suetonius in the same context as Cleopatra.\n\nMarriage\nAt an unspecified early date in her marriage to her husband Bogud he mounted an expedition along the Atlantic coast, seemingly venturing into the tropics. When he returned he presented his wife Euno\u00eb with gigantic reeds and asparagus he had found on the journey.She is believed to have been a mistress of Julius Caesar. She may have replaced Cleopatra in Caesar's affections, when he arrived in North Africa prior to the Battle of Thapsus on 6 April 46 BC, the two were among several queens courted by Caesar. It is also possible that they first met in Spain if she accompanied her husband there on a campaign. Only a brief romance for the Roman, both Eunoe and Bogudes profited through gifts bestowed on them by Caesar. Caesar departed from Africa in June 46 BC, five and a half months after he landed.\n\nCultural depictions\nEuno\u00eb and Caesar's affair is greatly exaggerated and expanded on in the Medieval French prose work Faits des Romains. Jeanette Beer in her book A Medieval Caesar states that the Roman general is \"transformed into Caesar, the medieval chevalier\" in the text, and that the author is more interested in Caesar's sexual dominance over the queen than the political dominance he held over her husband Bogud. The text describes her; \"Eunoe was the most beautiful woman in four kingdoms \u2014 nevertheless, she was Moorish\", which Beer further analysed as being indicative of the fact that it was unimaginable to audiences of the time to believe that a lover of Caesar could be ugly, but that Moors still represented everything that was ugly to them.Euno\u00eb has also been depicted in several novels about Caesar, as well as serialized stories in The Cornhill Magazine. In such fiction her character often serves as a foil for the relationship between Caesar and another woman, mostly Cleopatra, such as in The Memoirs of Cleopatra, The Bloodied Toga and When We Were Gods. In Song of the Nile she also plays a posthumous role as a person of interest for Cleopatra's daughter Selene II who became queen of Mauritania after her.Eunoe has also been depicted in a numismatic drawing by Italian artist and polymath Jacopo Strada, who lived in the 16th century. There is however no archaeological evidence of a coin that bears her name or picture.\n\nSee also\nWomen in ancient Rome\nPassage 7:\nCatherine Exley\nCatherine Exley (1779\u20131857) was an English diarist. She was the wife of a soldier who accompanied her husband when he served in Portugal, Spain, and Ireland during the Napoleonic Wars. Exley is best known as the author of a diary that gives an account of military life in that era from the viewpoint of the wife of a common soldier.\n\nBackground\nCatherine Whitaker was born at Leeds in 1779 and married Joshua Exley there in 1806. Between  1805 and 1815, Joshua served in the Second Battalion of the 34th Regiment of Foot, initially as a private and then for a little over two years, as a corporal. Exley accompanied her husband for a substantial portion of this time and in due course wrote an account that is probably unique in that it records and reflects on life in the British Army from the perspective of the wife of a soldier who did not reach the rank of an officer.\n\nThe diary\nCatherine's diary was first published as a booklet issued shortly after her death. A single copy of the booklet is known to exist, it was also reprinted in The Dewsbury Reporter during August 1923. The text of the diary is included in full in a more recently issued book, edited by Professor Rebecca Probert, along with essays on its military and religious context, the treatment of prisoners of war and the role of women in the British, French and Spanish armed forces during the Peninsular War.\nThe diary unfolds the hardships that both Catherine and her husband suffered during his military service, including one period when they both wrongly thought that the other had died. There are detailed accounts of the births and deaths of children, the cold, hunger and filthy conditions of military life and the horror of the aftermaths of battles. Details of the author's religious experiences which led her to membership of the Methodist church also appear. Exley wrote the diary during the last 20 years before her death, which took place in 1857 at Batley, Yorkshire.\nPassage 8:\nIlona Zr\u00ednyi\nCountess Ilona Zr\u00ednyi (Croatian: Jelena Zrinska, Hungarian: Zr\u00ednyi Ilona) (1643, Ozalj \u2013 18 February 1703, Izmit) was a noblewoman and heroine. She was one of the last surviving members of the Croatian-Hungarian Zrinski/Zr\u00ednyi noble family. She was the daughter of Petar Zrinski, Ban (viceroy) of Croatia, the niece of both Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi and Fran Krsto Frankopan and the wife of Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi I and Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, as well as the mother of Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II. She is remembered in history for her Defense of Palanok Castle against the Imperial army in 1685-1688, an act for which she was regarded a heroine in Hungary.\n\nLife\nEarly years and family\nIlona was born Ilona Zr\u00ednyi in Ozalj, present day Croatia. She was the eldest child of Croatian Ban, Peter Zrinyi, and his wife Katarina Zrinyi n\u00e9e Frankopan, a Croatian poet. Later her parents had two daughters, Judita Petronila (1652-1699), and Aurora Veronika (1658-1735), as well as a son, Ivan Antun (1651-1703). Ilona and her siblings were the last generation of descendants of the once-powerful Zrinski family.\nFrom her childhood, she was known for her beauty and good education. There is little information on her schooling; it is known though that she acquired a high level of knowledge within her family, not only from her father and mother, Croatian writers and erudite persons but from her uncle Nikola VII Zrinski as well.\n\nMarriages\nOn 1 March 1666, she married Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, with whom she had three children: Gy\u00f6rgy, born in 1667, who died in infancy; Julianna, born in 1672; and Ferenc (commonly known as Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II), born in 1676. On June 8, 1676, not long after Francis II's birth, the elder Francis died. The widowed Ilona requested guardianship of her children and was granted it, against the advice of Emperor Leopold I's advisers and against Francis I's will. In this way she also retained control over the vast R\u00e1k\u00f3czi estates, which included among them the castles of Reg\u00e9c, S\u00e1rospatak, Makovica, and Munk\u00e1cs. In 1682 she married Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly and became an active partner in her second husband's Kuruc uprising against the Habsburgs.\n\nDefense of Munk\u00e1cs (Palanok) Castle\nAfter their defeat at the 1683 Battle of Vienna, both the Ottoman forces and Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly's allied Kuruc fighters had no choice but to retreat, and Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly quickly lost one R\u00e1k\u00f3czi castle after another. At the end of 1685, the Imperial army surrounded the last remaining stronghold, Munkacs Castle in today's Ukraine. Ilona Zr\u00ednyi alone defended the castle for three years (1685\u20131688) against the forces of General Antonio Caraffa.\n\nInternment, exile and death\nAfter the recapture of Buda, the situation became untenable, and on 17 January 1688, Ilona had no choice but to surrender the castle, with the understanding that the defenders would receive amnesty from the Emperor, and that the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi estates would remain in her children's name. Under this agreement, she and her children traveled immediately to Vienna, where in violation of the pact the children were taken from her. Ilona lived until 1691 in the convent of the Ursulines, where her daughter Julianna was also raised. Her son Francis was immediately taken to the Jesuit school in Neuhaus.\nAt the time, her husband, Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, was still fighting with his Kuruc rebels against the Habsburg army in Upper Hungary. When Habsburg General Heisler was captured by Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, a prisoner exchange was arranged, and Ilona joined her husband in Transylvania. In 1699, however, after the Treaty of Karlowitz was signed, both spouses, having found themselves on the losing side, had to go into exile in the Ottoman Empire. The countess lived in Galata, district of Constantinople, and later in Izmit, where she died on 18 February 1703. She was buried in the French church of Saint Benoit in Galata.\n\nDescendants\nFrom her first marriage with Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, Ilona had three children:\n\nGy\u00f6rgy (1667\u20131667)\nJulianna Borb\u00e1la (September 1672 \u2013 1717); married Count Ferdinand Gobert von Aspremont-Lynden (1643-1708)\nFrancis II (27 March 1676 \u2013 8 April 1735)From her second marriage with Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, Ilona had three children, all of whom died at a young age (including one she was pregnant with during the siege of Munk\u00e1cs).\n\nLegacy\nIlona Zr\u00ednyi is celebrated in Croatia and Hungary as one of the greatest national heroines, patriots and fighters for freedom, who opposed, although unsuccessfully, the autocracy and absolutism aspirations of the Habsburgs. Her even more famous son Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi continued the struggle for the independence of Hungary (1703\u20131711).\nIn October 1906 the remains of the Croatian countess were reinterred with her son's in the St Elisabeth Cathedral in present-day Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia.\n\nHonors\nPostage stamp issued by Hungary on 28 September 1952.\n\nSee also\nHouse of Zrinski\nZrinski family tree\nZrinski\u2013Frankopan conspiracy\nKuruc\nR\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence\nWessel\u00e9nyi conspiracy\nPassage 9:\nArtaynte\nArtaynte (f. 478 BC), was the wife of the Crown Prince Darius.\n\nLife\nDaughter of an unnamed woman and Prince Masistes, a marshall of the armies during the invasion of Greece in 480-479 BC, and the brother of King Xerxes I.\nDuring the Greek campaign Xerxes developed a passionate desire for the wife of Masistes, but she would constantly resist and would not bend to his will. Upon his return to Sardis, the king endeavoured to bring about the marriage of his son Daris to Artaynte, the daughter of this woman the wife of Masistes, supposing that by doing so he could obtain her more easily.\nAfter moving to Susa he brought Artaynte to the royal house with him for his son Daris, but fell in love with her himself, and after obtaining her they became lovers. \nAt the behest of Xerxes, Artaynte committed adultery with him (Xerxes). When queen Amestris found out, she did not seek revenge against Artaynte, but against her mother, Masistes' wife, as Amestris thought that it was her connivance. On Xerxes' birthday, Amestris sent for his guards and mutilated Masistes' wife by cutting off her breasts and threw them to dogs, and her nose and ears and lips also, and cutting out her tongue as well. On seeing this, Masistes fled to Bactria to start a revolt, but was intercepted by Xerxes' army who killed him and his sons.\nPassage 10:\nHafsa Hatun\nHafsa Hatun (Ottoman Turkish: \u062d\u0641\u0635\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0646, \"young lioness\") was a Turkish princess, and a consort of Bayezid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nLife\nHafsa Hatun was the daughter of Isa Bey, the ruler of the Aydinids. She was married to Bayezid in 1390, upon his conquest of the Aydinids. Her father had surrendered without a fight, and a marriage was arranged between her and Bayezid. Thereafter, Isa was sent into exile in Iznik, shorn of his power, where he subsequently died. Her marriage strengthened the bonds between the two families.\n\nCharities\nHafsa Hatun's public works are located within her father's territory and may have been built before she married Bayezid. She commissioned a fountain in Tire city and a Hermitage in Bademiye, and a mosque known as \"Hafsa Hatun Mosque\" between 1390 and 1392 from the money she received in her dowry.\n\nSee also\nOttoman dynasty\nOttoman Empire\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The prolific 19th-century French writer Baron Ernouf suggested that Waldrada was of noble Gallo-Roman descent, sister of Thietgaud, the bishop of Trier, and niece of Gunther, archbishop of Cologne. However, these suggestions are not supported by any evidence, and more recent studies have instead suggested she was of relatively undistinguished social origins, though still from an aristocratic milieu.\nThe Vita Sancti Deicoli states that Waldrada was related to Eberhard II, Count of Nordgau (included Strasbourg) and the family of Etichonids, though this is a late 10th-century source and so may not be entirely reliable on this question.In 855 the Carolingian king Lothar II married Teutberga, a Carolingian aristocrat and the daughter of Bosonid Boso the Elder. The marriage was arranged by Lothar's father Lothar I for political reasons. It is very probable that Waldrada was already Lothar II's mistress at this time.Teutberga was allegedly not capable of bearing children and Lothar's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain an annulment of their marriage, and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavour. Lothair, whose desire for annulment was arguably prompted by his affection for Waldrada, put away Teutberga. However, Hucbert took up arms on his sister's behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858. Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother, Emperor Louis II, by a cession of lands and obtained the consent of the local clergy to the annulment and to his marriage with Waldrada, which took place in 862. However, Pope Nicholas I was suspicious of this and sent legates to investigate at the Council of Metz in 863. The Council found in favour of Lothair's divorce, which led to rumours that the papal legates may have bribed and thus meant that Nicholas order Lothair to take Teutberga back or face excommunication. \nWith the support of Charles the Bald and Louis the German, Teutberga appealed the annulment to Pope Nicholas. Nicholas refused to recognize the annulment and excommunicated Waldrada in 866, forcing Lothair to abandon Waldrada in favour of Teutberga. Lothair accepted this begrudgingly for a time, but shortly afterward at the end of 867 Pope Nicholas I died. Thus, Lothair began to seek the permission of the newly appointed Pope Adrian II to again put Teutberga aside and marry Waldrada, riding to Rome to speak with him on the matter in 869. However, on his way home, Lothair died.\n\nChildren\nWaldrada and Lothair II had some sons and probably three daughters, all of whom were declared illegitimate:\n\nHugh (c. 855\u2013895), Duke of Alsace (867\u2013885)\nGisela (c. 865\u2013908), who in 883 married Godfrey, the Viking leader ruling in Frisia, who was murdered in 885\nBertha (c. 863\u2013925), who married Theobald of Arles (c. 854\u2013895), count of Arles, nephew of Teutberga. They had two sons, Hugh of Italy and Boso of Tuscany. After Theobald's death, between 895 and 898 she married Adalbert II of Tuscany (c. 875\u2013915) They had at least three children: Guy, who succeeded his father as count and duke of Lucca and margrave of Tuscany, Lambert succeeded his brother in 929, but lost the titles in 931 to his half-brother Boso of Tuscany, and Ermengard.\nErmengarde (d. 90?)\nOdo (d. c.879)\nPassage 2:\nFrancis I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi\nFrancis I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi (February 24, 1645, Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, Transylvania \u2013 July 8, 1676, Zbor\u00f3, Royal Hungary) was a Hungarian aristocrat, elected prince of Transylvania and father of Hungarian national hero Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II.Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was the son of George R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II, prince of Transylvania, and Sophia B\u00e1thory. He was elected prince by the Transylvanian Diet in 1652, during his father's life. However, because of the disastrous Polish campaign of 1657 and its consequences, the Ottoman Empire removed his father from the throne in 1660, and prohibited any R\u00e1k\u00f3czi to ascend the Transylvanian throne. This left Francis unable to come by his father's legacy; he therefore withdrew to his estates in Royal Hungary.\nNotably, the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi family was Calvinist, and they were staunch supporters of the Reformed Church in Hungary. However, Francis' mother, Sophia B\u00e1thory, had converted to Calvinism merely for the sake of her marriage. After her husband's death, she returned to Catholicism and supported the Counter Reformation. Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi also became a Catholic, thus acquiring favour with the Catholic Habsburg Court. His mother converted him to Catholicism. He was made a count in 1664.\nIn 1666 Francis married Jelena Zrinska (Hungarian: Zr\u00ednyi Ilona), a Croatian countess, and joined the Wessel\u00e9nyi conspiracy (Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy in Croatia), one leader of which was Jelena's father, Petar Zrinski (Hungarian: Zr\u00ednyi P\u00e9ter). Francis soon became the leader of the conspiracy, and, as a culmination of their anti-Habsburg stratagems, started an armed uprising of nobles in Upper Hungary, while the other conspirators were supposed to start the fight in Croatia. Due to poor organization and discord between the conspirators, however, the Austrian authorities were well informed; they quickly suppressed the Croatian branch of the revolt.\nWhen R\u00e1k\u00f3czi learned that Petar Zrinski had been captured by the Austrians, he laid down his arms and applied for mercy. All other leaders of the conspiracy were executed for high treason; R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, due to his mother's intervention, and for a ransom of 300,000 forints and several castles, was pardoned.\n\nIssue\nFrancis I had three  children:\n\nGy\u00f6rgy (1667)\nJulianna Borb\u00e1la (1672\u20131717), married Count Ferdinand Gobert von Aspremont-Lynden (1643-1708)\nFrancis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II (1676\u20131735)Francis II was born only three months before his father's death. He led a rebellion against Austrian rule (R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence) and died in exile.\nPassage 3:\nMary Fiennes (lady-in-waiting)\nMary Fiennes (1495\u20131531) was an English courtier. She was the wife of Henry Norris. Norris was executed for treason as one of the alleged lovers of her cousin, Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII of England. Mary lived for six years at the French court as a Maid of Honour to queens consort Mary Tudor, wife of Louis XII; and Claude of France, wife of Francis I.\n\nFamily and early years\nMary was born at Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex in 1495, the only daughter of Thomas Fiennes, 8th Baron Dacre and Anne Bourchier. By both her father and mother she was descended from Edward III. She had two younger brothers, Sir Thomas and John. Her mother was an elder half-sister of Elizabeth Howard and Lord Edmund Howard, making queen consorts Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard a cousin of Mary. Her paternal grandmother, Alice FitzHugh, was sister to Elizabeth FitzHugh, grandmother of Catherine Parr, making her cousin to yet another queen consort of Henry VIII.\nIn 1514, Mary was appointed a Maid of Honour to Princess Mary Tudor and accompanied her to France when the latter married King Louis XII of France; afterwards she served in the capacity to Queen Mary's successor, Queen Claude, consort of the new king Francis I of France. Among her fellow Maids of Honour were her cousins, Mary (a mistress of Henry VIII) and Anne Boleyn.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1520 upon her return to England, she married the courtier, Henry Norreys (1491 \u2013 17 May 1536) of Yattendon in Berkshire, whom she had met that same year at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in France.\nNorris served King Henry VIII of England as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and was held in high favour by the King. He was later appointed Groom of the Stool and continued to enjoy the King's favour. According to biographer Eric Ives, Norris was \"perhaps the nearest thing Henry had to a friend.\" Norris had control of King Henry's Privy chamber.\nHenry and Mary had three children:\nEdward Norris (died 1529)\nHenry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys (c.\u20091525 \u2013 1601), married Margaret Williams of Rycote, by whom he had issue.\nMary Norris, married firstly Sir George Carew, and secondly Sir Arthur Champernowne, by whom she had issue.\n\nDeath\nMary died in 1531, a year after her mother. Five years later her husband was attainted and executed for treason as one of the five alleged lovers of her cousin Queen Anne Boleyn, who herself was beheaded at the Tower of London on 19 May 1536.\nTheir four orphaned children were raised by Norris's brother Sir John Norris.\n\nAncestry\nPassage 4:\nAgatha (wife of Samuel of Bulgaria)\nAgatha (Bulgarian: \u0410\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430, Greek: \u0386\u03b3\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7; fl.\u2009late 10th century) was the wife of Emperor Samuel of Bulgaria.\n\nBiography\nAccording to a later addition to the history of the late-11th-century Byzantine historian John Skylitzes, Agatha was a captive from Larissa, and the daughter of the magnate of Dyrrhachium, John Chryselios. Skylitzes explicitly refers to her as the mother of Samuel's heir Gavril Radomir, which means that she was probably Samuel's wife. On the other hand, Skylitzes later mentions that Gavril Radomir himself also took a beautiful captive, named Irene, from Larissa as his wife. According to the editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit, this may have been a source of confusion for a later copyist, and Agatha's real origin was not Larissa, but Dyrrhachium. According to the same work, it is likely that she had died by ca. 998, when her father surrendered Dyrrhachium to the Byzantine emperor Basil II.Only two of Samuel's and Agatha's children are definitely known by name: Gavril Radomir and Miroslava. Two further, unnamed, daughters are mentioned in 1018, while Samuel is also recorded as having had a bastard son.Agatha is one of the central characters in Dimitar Talev's novel Samuil.\nPassage 5:\nEmpress Sh\u014dken\nEmpress Dowager Sh\u014dken (\u662d\u61b2\u7687\u592a\u540e, Sh\u014dken-k\u014dtaig\u014d, 9 May 1849 \u2013 9 April 1914), born Masako Ichij\u014d (\u4e00\u6761\u52dd\u5b50, Ichij\u014d Masako), was the wife of Emperor Meiji of Japan. She is also known under the technically incorrect name Empress Sh\u014dken (\u662d\u61b2\u7687\u540e, Sh\u014dken-k\u014dg\u014d). She was one of the founders of the Japanese Red Cross Society, whose charity work was known throughout the First Sino-Japanese War.\n\nEarly life\nLady Masako Ichij\u014d was born on 9 May 1849, in Heian-ky\u014d, Japan. She was the third daughter of Tadayoshi Ichij\u014d, former Minister of the Left and head of the Fujiwara clan's Ichij\u014d branch. Her adoptive mother was one of Prince Fushimi Kuniie's daughters, but her biological mother was Tamiko Niihata, the daughter of a doctor from the Ichij\u014d family. Unusually for the time, she had been vaccinated against smallpox. As a child, Masako was somewhat of a prodigy: she was able to read poetry from the Kokin Wakash\u016b by the age of 4 and had composed some waka verses of her own by the age of 5. By age seven, she was able to read some texts in classical Chinese with some assistance and was studying Japanese calligraphy. By the age of 12, she had studied the koto and was fond of Noh drama. She excelled in the studies of finances, ikebana and Japanese tea ceremony.The major obstacle to Lady Masako's eligibility to become empress consort was the fact that she was 3 years older than Emperor Meiji, but this issue was resolved by changing her official birth date from 1849 to 1850. They became engaged on 2 September 1867, when she adopted the given name Haruko (\u7f8e\u5b50), which was intended to reflect her \nserene beauty and diminutive size.\nThe Tokugawa Bakufu promised 15,000 ry\u014d in gold for the wedding and assigned her an annual income of 500 koku, but as the Meiji Restoration occurred before the wedding could be completed, the promised amounts were never delivered. The wedding was delayed partly due to periods of mourning for Emperor K\u014dmei,  for her brother Saneyoshi, and the political disturbances around Kyoto between 1867 and 1868.\n\nEmpress of Japan\nLady Haruko and Emperor Meiji's wedding was finally officially celebrated on 11 January 1869. She was the first imperial consort to receive the title of both ny\u014dg\u014d and of k\u014dg\u014d (literally, the emperor's wife, translated as \"empress consort\"), in several hundred years. However, it soon became clear that she was unable to bear children. Emperor Meiji already had 12 children by 5 concubines, though: as custom in Japanese monarchy, Empress Haruko adopted Yoshihito, her husband's eldest son by Lady Yanagihara Naruko, who became Crown Prince. On 8 November 1869, the Imperial House departed from Kyoto for the new capital of Tokyo. In a break from tradition, Emperor Meiji insisted that the Empress and the senior ladies-in-waiting should attend the educational lectures given to the Emperor on a regular basis about national conditions and developments in foreign nations.\n\nInfluence\nOn 30 July 1886, Empress Haruko attended the Peeresses School's graduation ceremony in Western clothing. On 10 August, the imperial couple received foreign guests in Western clothing for the first time when hosting a Western Music concert.From this point onward, the Empress' entourage wore only Western-style clothes in public, to the point that in January 1887 \nEmpress Haruko issued a memorandum on the subject: traditional Japanese dress was not only unsuited to modern life, but Western-style dress was closer than the kimono to clothes worn by Japanese women in ancient times.In the diplomatic field, Empress Haruko hosted the wife of former US President Ulysses S. Grant during his visit to Japan. She was also present for her husband's meetings with Hawaiian King Kal\u0101kaua in 1881. Later that same year, she helped host the visit of the sons of future British King Edward VII: Princes Albert Victor and George (future George V), who presented her with a pair of pet wallabies from Australia.On  26 November 1886, Empress Haruko accompanied her husband to Yokosuka, Kanagawa to observe the new Imperial Japanese Navy cruisers Naniwa and Takachiho firing torpedoes and performing other maneuvers. From 1887, the Empress was often at the Emperor's side in official visits to army maneuvers. When Emperor Meiji fell ill in 1888, Empress Haruko took his place in welcoming envoys from Siam, launching warships and visiting Tokyo Imperial University. In 1889, Empress Haruko accompanied Emperor Meiji on his official visit to Nagoya and Kyoto. While he continued on to visit naval bases at Kure and Sasebo, she went to Nara to worship at the principal Shinto shrines.Known throughout her tenure for her support of charity work and women's education during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395), Empress Haruko worked for the establishment of the Japanese Red Cross Society. She participated in the organization's administration, especially in their peacetime activities in which she created a money fund for the International Red Cross. Renamed \"The Empress Sh\u014dken Fund\", it is presently used for international welfare activities. After Emperor Meiji moved his military headquarters from Tokyo to Hiroshima to be closer to the lines of communications with his troops, Empress Haruko joined her husband in March 1895. While in Hiroshima, she insisted on visiting hospitals full of wounded soldiers every other day of her stay.\n\nDeath\nAfter Emperor Meiji's death in 1912, Empress Haruko was granted the title Empress Dowager (\u7687\u592a\u540e, K\u014dtaig\u014d) by her adoptive son, Emperor Taish\u014d. She died in 1914 at the Imperial Villa in Numazu, Shizuoka and was buried in the East Mound of the Fushimi Momoyama Ryo in Fushimi, Kyoto, next to her husband. Her soul was enshrined in Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. On 9 May 1914, she received the posthumous name Sh\u014dken K\u014dtaig\u014d (\u662d\u61b2\u7687\u592a\u540e). Her railway-carriage can be seen today in the Meiji Mura Museum, in Inuyama, Aichi prefecture.\n\nHonours\nNational\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Precious Crown, 1 November 1888\n\nForeign\nShe received the following orders and decorations:\n Russian Empire: Grand Cross of the Order of St. Catherine, 13 December 1887\n Spain: Dame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa, 29 November 1889\n Siam: Dame of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri, 12 October 1899\n German Empire: Dame of the Order of Louise, 1st Class, 19 May 1903\n Kingdom of Bavaria: Dame of Honour of the Order of Theresa, 29 February 1904\n Korean Empire: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Auspicious Phoenix, 27 July 1908\n\nAncestry\nSee also\nEmpress of Japan\n\u014cmiya Palace\n\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nEuno\u00eb (wife of Bogudes)\nEuno\u00eb Maura was the wife of Bogudes, King of Western Mauretania. Her name has also been spelled Euries or Euryes or Eunoa.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nEuno\u00eb Maura was thought to be descended from Berbers, but her name is Greek so it appears she might have been from there or had Greek ancestry. She was likely of very high status, as she is mentioned by historian Suetonius in the same context as Cleopatra.\n\nMarriage\nAt an unspecified early date in her marriage to her husband Bogud he mounted an expedition along the Atlantic coast, seemingly venturing into the tropics. When he returned he presented his wife Euno\u00eb with gigantic reeds and asparagus he had found on the journey.She is believed to have been a mistress of Julius Caesar. She may have replaced Cleopatra in Caesar's affections, when he arrived in North Africa prior to the Battle of Thapsus on 6 April 46 BC, the two were among several queens courted by Caesar. It is also possible that they first met in Spain if she accompanied her husband there on a campaign. Only a brief romance for the Roman, both Eunoe and Bogudes profited through gifts bestowed on them by Caesar. Caesar departed from Africa in June 46 BC, five and a half months after he landed.\n\nCultural depictions\nEuno\u00eb and Caesar's affair is greatly exaggerated and expanded on in the Medieval French prose work Faits des Romains. Jeanette Beer in her book A Medieval Caesar states that the Roman general is \"transformed into Caesar, the medieval chevalier\" in the text, and that the author is more interested in Caesar's sexual dominance over the queen than the political dominance he held over her husband Bogud. The text describes her; \"Eunoe was the most beautiful woman in four kingdoms \u2014 nevertheless, she was Moorish\", which Beer further analysed as being indicative of the fact that it was unimaginable to audiences of the time to believe that a lover of Caesar could be ugly, but that Moors still represented everything that was ugly to them.Euno\u00eb has also been depicted in several novels about Caesar, as well as serialized stories in The Cornhill Magazine. In such fiction her character often serves as a foil for the relationship between Caesar and another woman, mostly Cleopatra, such as in The Memoirs of Cleopatra, The Bloodied Toga and When We Were Gods. In Song of the Nile she also plays a posthumous role as a person of interest for Cleopatra's daughter Selene II who became queen of Mauritania after her.Eunoe has also been depicted in a numismatic drawing by Italian artist and polymath Jacopo Strada, who lived in the 16th century. There is however no archaeological evidence of a coin that bears her name or picture.\n\nSee also\nWomen in ancient Rome\nPassage 7:\nCatherine Exley\nCatherine Exley (1779\u20131857) was an English diarist. She was the wife of a soldier who accompanied her husband when he served in Portugal, Spain, and Ireland during the Napoleonic Wars. Exley is best known as the author of a diary that gives an account of military life in that era from the viewpoint of the wife of a common soldier.\n\nBackground\nCatherine Whitaker was born at Leeds in 1779 and married Joshua Exley there in 1806. Between  1805 and 1815, Joshua served in the Second Battalion of the 34th Regiment of Foot, initially as a private and then for a little over two years, as a corporal. Exley accompanied her husband for a substantial portion of this time and in due course wrote an account that is probably unique in that it records and reflects on life in the British Army from the perspective of the wife of a soldier who did not reach the rank of an officer.\n\nThe diary\nCatherine's diary was first published as a booklet issued shortly after her death. A single copy of the booklet is known to exist, it was also reprinted in The Dewsbury Reporter during August 1923. The text of the diary is included in full in a more recently issued book, edited by Professor Rebecca Probert, along with essays on its military and religious context, the treatment of prisoners of war and the role of women in the British, French and Spanish armed forces during the Peninsular War.\nThe diary unfolds the hardships that both Catherine and her husband suffered during his military service, including one period when they both wrongly thought that the other had died. There are detailed accounts of the births and deaths of children, the cold, hunger and filthy conditions of military life and the horror of the aftermaths of battles. Details of the author's religious experiences which led her to membership of the Methodist church also appear. Exley wrote the diary during the last 20 years before her death, which took place in 1857 at Batley, Yorkshire.\nPassage 8:\nIlona Zr\u00ednyi\nCountess Ilona Zr\u00ednyi (Croatian: Jelena Zrinska, Hungarian: Zr\u00ednyi Ilona) (1643, Ozalj \u2013 18 February 1703, Izmit) was a noblewoman and heroine. She was one of the last surviving members of the Croatian-Hungarian Zrinski/Zr\u00ednyi noble family. She was the daughter of Petar Zrinski, Ban (viceroy) of Croatia, the niece of both Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi and Fran Krsto Frankopan and the wife of Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi I and Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, as well as the mother of Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II. She is remembered in history for her Defense of Palanok Castle against the Imperial army in 1685-1688, an act for which she was regarded a heroine in Hungary.\n\nLife\nEarly years and family\nIlona was born Ilona Zr\u00ednyi in Ozalj, present day Croatia. She was the eldest child of Croatian Ban, Peter Zrinyi, and his wife Katarina Zrinyi n\u00e9e Frankopan, a Croatian poet. Later her parents had two daughters, Judita Petronila (1652-1699), and Aurora Veronika (1658-1735), as well as a son, Ivan Antun (1651-1703). Ilona and her siblings were the last generation of descendants of the once-powerful Zrinski family.\nFrom her childhood, she was known for her beauty and good education. There is little information on her schooling; it is known though that she acquired a high level of knowledge within her family, not only from her father and mother, Croatian writers and erudite persons but from her uncle Nikola VII Zrinski as well.\n\nMarriages\nOn 1 March 1666, she married Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, with whom she had three children: Gy\u00f6rgy, born in 1667, who died in infancy; Julianna, born in 1672; and Ferenc (commonly known as Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II), born in 1676. On June 8, 1676, not long after Francis II's birth, the elder Francis died. The widowed Ilona requested guardianship of her children and was granted it, against the advice of Emperor Leopold I's advisers and against Francis I's will. In this way she also retained control over the vast R\u00e1k\u00f3czi estates, which included among them the castles of Reg\u00e9c, S\u00e1rospatak, Makovica, and Munk\u00e1cs. In 1682 she married Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly and became an active partner in her second husband's Kuruc uprising against the Habsburgs.\n\nDefense of Munk\u00e1cs (Palanok) Castle\nAfter their defeat at the 1683 Battle of Vienna, both the Ottoman forces and Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly's allied Kuruc fighters had no choice but to retreat, and Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly quickly lost one R\u00e1k\u00f3czi castle after another. At the end of 1685, the Imperial army surrounded the last remaining stronghold, Munkacs Castle in today's Ukraine. Ilona Zr\u00ednyi alone defended the castle for three years (1685\u20131688) against the forces of General Antonio Caraffa.\n\nInternment, exile and death\nAfter the recapture of Buda, the situation became untenable, and on 17 January 1688, Ilona had no choice but to surrender the castle, with the understanding that the defenders would receive amnesty from the Emperor, and that the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi estates would remain in her children's name. Under this agreement, she and her children traveled immediately to Vienna, where in violation of the pact the children were taken from her. Ilona lived until 1691 in the convent of the Ursulines, where her daughter Julianna was also raised. Her son Francis was immediately taken to the Jesuit school in Neuhaus.\nAt the time, her husband, Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, was still fighting with his Kuruc rebels against the Habsburg army in Upper Hungary. When Habsburg General Heisler was captured by Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, a prisoner exchange was arranged, and Ilona joined her husband in Transylvania. In 1699, however, after the Treaty of Karlowitz was signed, both spouses, having found themselves on the losing side, had to go into exile in the Ottoman Empire.

Upon his return to Sardis, the king endeavoured to bring about the marriage of his son Daris to Artaynte, the daughter of this woman the wife of Masistes, supposing that by doing so he could obtain her more easily.\nAfter moving to Susa he brought Artaynte to the royal house with him for his son Daris, but fell in love with her himself, and after obtaining her they became lovers. \nAt the behest of Xerxes, Artaynte committed adultery with him (Xerxes). When queen Amestris found out, she did not seek revenge against Artaynte, but against her mother, Masistes' wife, as Amestris thought that it was her connivance. On Xerxes' birthday, Amestris sent for his guards and mutilated Masistes' wife by cutting off her breasts and threw them to dogs, and her nose and ears and lips also, and cutting out her tongue as well. On seeing this, Masistes fled to Bactria to start a revolt, but was intercepted by Xerxes' army who killed him and his sons.\nPassage 10:\nHafsa Hatun\nHafsa Hatun (Ottoman Turkish: \u062d\u0641\u0635\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0646, \"young lioness\") was a Turkish princess, and a consort of Bayezid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nLife\nHafsa Hatun was the daughter of Isa Bey, the ruler of the Aydinids. She was married to Bayezid in 1390, upon his conquest of the Aydinids. Her father had surrendered without a fight, and a marriage was arranged between her and Bayezid. Thereafter, Isa was sent into exile in Iznik, shorn of his power, where he subsequently died. Her marriage strengthened the bonds between the two families.\n\nCharities\nHafsa Hatun's public works are located within her father's territory and may have been built before she married Bayezid. She commissioned a fountain in Tire city and a Hermitage in Bademiye, and a mosque known as \"Hafsa Hatun Mosque\" between 1390 and 1392 from the money she received in her dowry.\n\nSee also\nOttoman dynasty\nOttoman Empire", "answers": ["Ozalj"], "pred": " Question: Answer: Question: Answer: Question: Answer: Question: Answer: Question: Answer: Question: Answer: Question: Answer: Question: Answer:", "length": 4696, "dataset": "2wikimqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "41ac2a4beb0af8f58d01863a62b90692f7c7d74b5e3a58d9"}

She started her career as a child actress. Later she appeared in lead actress and supporting actress roles. She has acted in over 300 films in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, and Bhojpuri languages. She won two Nandi Awards and one Filmfare Award.\n\nCareer\nTulasi made her debut in the Telugu language when she was three months old in 1967. For a song in a film, a baby was needed and Tulasi was placed in the cradle after actress Savitri had requested Tulasi's mother, who was a friend of her. She was featured in a song when she was three-and-half years old in Jeevanatarangalu and said that she became a full-fledged actor when she was four. She had never been to school.She got married at age 28 to Kannada director Sivamani. She stated, \"I met him in the morning and by evening we tied the knot\". They have one son, Sai Tarun. Tulasi decided to quit acting after getting married, working only occasionally as a voice actor in Telugu films, including ones by Mani Ratnam. When her son was around six years old, she received several mother character roles. She initially declined them all, but finally signed on one Kannada film, Excuse Me, in which she played mother to Divya Spandana and which became a big hit. After that she was doing three films a year in Kannada.\nShe began to act mainly in mother roles in Telugu and Tamil film industries. Her notable supporting roles include performances in Sasirekha Parinayam, Mr. Perfect, Darling, Srimanthudu, Iddarammayilatho, Nenu Local, Mahanati & Dear Comrade in Telugu and Pillaiyar Theru Kadaisi Veedu, Easan, Mankatha, Sundarapandian, Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer and Pandiya Naadu in Tamil. Tulasi has said that Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer, in which she had played mother to Manisha Yadav's character, changed her life and brought her an \"identity as a screen mother\". Her portrayal of Chellamma in Pannaiyarum Padminiyum was praised too, with critics stating that she was \"brilliant\", and had given her \"career best performance\".\n\nPartial filmography\nAwards\nNandi AwardsBest Child Actress - Seetamalakshmi (1978)\nBest Child Actress - Sankarabharanam (1980)Filmfare Awards SouthFilmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress - Kannada - Josh\nPassage 3:\nStokkseyrar-D\u00edsa\nThordis Markusdottir (\u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Mark\u00fasd\u00f3ttir), known as Stokkseyrar-D\u00edsa (1668\u20131728), was an Icelandic magician (Galdrmaster). She is known in history for her alleged magical powers. She is the subject of a least ten different folk sagas depicting her experiments within magic or Galdr.\nThordis Markusdottir belonged to the elite of the Iceland and was the grandchild of sheriff Torfi Erlendsson of Stafnes and related to Thormodus Torf\u00e6us, historian of the King of Denmark. She lived in Stokkseyri, thereby the name Stokkseyrar-D\u00edsa.

She was past normal child-bearing age when she conceived and gave birth to John.\n\nBiblical narrative\nAccording to the Gospel of Luke chapter 1, Elizabeth was \"of the daughters of Aaron\". She and her husband Zechariah/Zachariah were \"righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless\" (1:5\u20137), but childless. While he was in the temple of the Lord (1:8\u201312), Zachariah was visited by the angel Gabriel:\n\nBut the angel said to him: \u201cDo not be afraid, Zechariah; your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.\nZachariah doubted whereby he could know this since both he and his wife were old. The angel identified himself as Gabriel and told Zachariah that he would be \"dumb, and not able to speak\" until the words were fulfilled, because he did not believe. When the days of his ministry were complete, he returned to his house (Luke 1:16\u201323).\n\nAfter this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. \u201cThe Lord has done this for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIn these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.\u201d\nAccording to the account, the angel Gabriel was then sent to Nazareth in Galilee to her relative Mary, a virgin, betrothed to a man called Joseph, and informed her that she would conceive by the Holy Spirit and bring forth a son to be called Jesus. Mary was also informed that her \"relative Elizabeth\" had begun her sixth month of pregnancy, and Mary traveled to \"a town in the hill country of Judah\", to visit Elizabeth (Luke 1:26\u201340).\n\nWhen Elizabeth heard Mary\u2019s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!\"\nMatthew Henry comments, \"Mary knew that Elizabeth was with child, but it does not appear that Elizabeth had been told anything of her relative Mary's being designed for the mother of the Messiah; and therefore what knowledge she appears to have had of it must have come by a revelation, which would be a great encouragement to Mary.\" After Mary heard Elizabeth's blessing, she spoke the words now known as the Magnificat (Luke 1:46\u201355). \n\nMary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, but his mother spoke up and said, \u201cNo! He is to be called John.\u201dThey said to her, \u201cThere is no one among your relatives who has that name.\u201dThen they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone\u2019s astonishment he wrote, \u201cHis name is John.\u201d Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.\nThat is the last mention of Elizabeth, who is not mentioned in any other chapter in the Bible. The chapter continues with the prophecy of Zachariah (known as the Benedictus,) and ends with the note that John \"grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts\" until his ministry to Israel began; so it is unknown how long Elizabeth and her husband lived after that (Luke 1:65\u201380).\nSince the Medieval era, Elizabeth's greeting, \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,\" has formed the second part of the Hail Mary prayer.A traditional \"tomb of Elizabeth\" is shown in the Franciscan Monastery of Saint John in the Wilderness near Jerusalem.\n\nApocrypha\nElizabeth is mentioned in several books of the Apocrypha, most prominently in the Protevangelion of James, in which the birth of her son, the subsequent murder of her husband, as well as her and John's miraculous escape during the Massacre of the Innocents are chronicled.\n\nSainthood\nElizabeth is revered as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church on 5 November, and in the Orthodox and Anglican traditions on 5 September, on the same day with her husband Zacharias/Zechariah. She is commemorated as a matriarch in the Calendar of Saints (5 September) of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and Zacharias is commemorated as a prophet.She is also commemorated on 30 March in Eastern Orthodox Church (Visitation).\n\nIslam\nElizabeth (Arabic: Isha', daughter of Faqudh), the wife of Zakaria, the mother of Yahya, is an honored woman in Islam. Although Zachariah himself is frequently mentioned by name in the Qur'an, Elizabeth, while not mentioned by name, is referenced. She is revered by Muslims as a wise, pious and believing person who, like her relative Mary, was exalted by God to a high station. She lived in the household of Imran, and is said to have been a descendant of the prophet and priest Harun.Zachariah and his wife were both devout and steadfast in their duties. They were, however, both very old and they had no son. Therefore, Zachariah would frequently pray to God for a son. This was not only out of the desire to have a son but also because the great Jesus wanted someone to carry on the services of the Temple of prayer and to continue the preaching of the Lord's message before his death.\nGod cured Elizabeth's barrenness and granted Zachariah a son, Yahya (John the Baptist), who became a prophet. God thus granted the wishes of the couple because of their faith, trust and love for God. In the Qur'an, God speaks of Zachariah, his wife, and John, and describes the three as being humble servants of the Lord:\n\nSo We listened to him: and We granted him John: We cured his wife's (Barrenness) for him. These (three) were ever quick in emulation in good works; they used to call on Us with love and reverence, and humble themselves before Us.\nIn Sunni Islamic reports of al-Tabari and al-Masudi, Elizabeth is said to have been a daughter of Imran, and thus, a sister of Mary. Therefore, their children Jesus (Isa) and John (Yahya) are believed to have been cousins. In other accounts, Elizabeth is said to be a daughter of Fakudh, and a sister of Imran's wife Hannah.In Shia hadith she is named Hananah, and is identified as a sister of Mary's mother Hannah. Abu Basir recorded that Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, the great grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, had stated: \"Hannah, the wife of Imran, and Hananah, the wife of Zechariah, were sisters. He goes on to say that Mary was born from Hannah and John was born from Hananah. Mary gave birth to Jesus and he was the son of the daughter of John's aunt. John was the son of the aunt of Mary, and the aunt of one's mother is like one's aunt.\"\n\nMandaeism\nIn Mandaeism, Eni\u0161bai (Classical Mandaic: \u084f\u084d\u0849\u0854\u0841\u0840\u0849, romanized: \u02bfni\u0161bai) is the Mandaic name for Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. Eni\u0161bai is mentioned in chapters 18, 21, and 32 of the Mandaean Book of John.\n\nSee also\nGospel of Luke\nVisitation (Catholic feast)\nEin Kerem, traditional home town of Elizabeth, Zechariah and John\nBiblical figures in Islamic tradition\nSaint Elizabeth, patron saint archive\n\nNotes and references\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

The name of Sobe first appears in writings of about the 7th century by Hippolytus of Thebes, Andrew of Crete, and Epiphanius Monachus, and later in Nicephorus Callistus and Andronicus. All recount essentially the same passage, given by the last two as follows:\n\nThere were three sisters of Bethlehem, daughters of Matthan the priest, and Mary his wife, under the reign of Cleopatra and Sosipatrus, before the reign of Herod, the son of Antipater: the eldest was Mary, the second was Sobe, the youngest's name was Anne. The eldest being married in Bethlehem, had for daughter Salome the midwife; Sobe the second likewise married in Bethlehem, and was the mother of Elizabeth; last of all the third married in Galilee, and brought forth Mary the mother of Christ.\n\nThe 19th-century mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich claims that according to her visions (which give a detailed genealogy of Mary), Sobe was a sister of Anne, but the mother of Elizabeth was Emerentia, Sobe and Anne's maternal aunt.\n\nSee also\nList of names for the biblical nameless\nPassage 6:\nConstance Anne Herschel\nConstance Anne Herschel (1855 - 1939), later known as Lady Lubbock, was a scientist and mathematician.\nHerschel held the post of resident lecturer in natural sciences and mathematics at Girton College, Cambridge.She was the child of Sir John Frederick William Herschel, and the grandchild of William Herschel. She wrote a family history of the famous scientific dynasty by compiling family sources, 'The Herschel Chronicle'.She married Sir Neville Lubbock.\nPassage 7:\nAlbina du Boisrouvray\nCountess Albina du Boisrouvray (born 1941) is a former journalist and film producer who has become a global philanthropist and social entrepreneur working with AIDS victims and impoverished communities around the world. She is the founder of FXB International, a non-governmental organization established in memory of her son, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud.Du Boisrouvray is a grandchild of the Bolivian King of Tin, Sim\u00f3n Pati\u00f1o.

She worked as a freelance journalist for Le Nouvel Observateur, covering international stories such as the death of Che Guevara. She later co-founded the literary magazine Libre with Juan Goytisolo.In 1978, du Boisrouvray ran as a candidate for the Friends of the Earth party in parliamentary elections.She founded a film production company, Albina Productions, in 1969 and is credited with producing 22 films over a period of 17 years. These films include Pascal Thomas' first film, Les Zozos (1972), L'important c'est d'aimer and Une Femme a sa fen\u00eatre, both of which starred Romy Schneider, and Fort Saganne (1984), directed by Alain Corneau and starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Catherine Deneuve and Sophie Marceau. Police Python 357 (1976) notably was one of the few films which starred Yves Montand and Simone Signoret, a well-known couple, in the same film. Du Boisrouvray began serving as the chairperson of SEGH, her family's real estate and hotel management group, in 1980.\n\nFXB International\nFollowing the death of her only child, du Boisrouvray sold three-quarters of her assets including a jewelry collection auctioned by Sotheby's in New York for $31.2 million, an art collection of $20 million, and a substantial part of her family real-estate business which garnered $50 million. The Sotheby's auction was the largest jewelry sale since the Duchess of Windsor's auction. The sale included pre-Columbian gold, jade and other notable pieces accumulated by the noble French family. Du Boisrouvray allocated part of the profits to the FXB Foundation to create programs, including an at home palliative care program for the terminally ill in Switzerland and France, a rescue helicopter control centre in the Swiss Alps, and a professorship at the University of Michigan (her son's alma mater). The rest of the funds were used to found FXB International in memory of her son, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud, a search-and-rescue pilot who died while serving as a transport pilot in Mali during the Paris-Dakar rally in 1986.Du Boisrouvray founded FXB International is to fight poverty and AIDS, and support orphans and vulnerable children left in the wake of the AIDS pandemic. FXB International offers comprehensive support to the families and communities that care for these children, and advocates for their fundamental rights. The organization has helped over 17 million people from programs in more than 100 countries, with a staff of over 450. Du Boisrouvray broadened its work from supporting children impacted by AIDS to also include all families needing support to emerge from extreme poverty and become self-sufficient through the FXBVillage methodology. In 1991, she developed the FXBVillage Methodology, a community-based, sustainable approach to overcoming the AIDS orphans crisis and extreme poverty. Each FXBVillage supports 80-100 families, comprising approximately 500 individuals, mostly children. Over a three-year period, FXB provides communities with the resources and training needed to become physically, financially and socially independent. According to FXB, the FXBVillage program has graduated over 69,500 participants from eight countries and has over 12,500 current participants.In 1993, du Boisrouvray founded the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University, the first academic center to focus exclusively on health and human rights.\n\nAwards and recognition\nDu Boisrouvray was made Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres in 1985.

He is the only grandchild of Oscar Wilde, whose life he has researched and written about extensively.\n\nBiography\nBorn in London in December 1945, Christopher Merlin Vyvyan Holland is the son of the author Vyvyan Holland and his second wife, Thelma Besant. He is the only grandchild of Oscar Wilde and Constance Lloyd.His mother Thelma was an Australian cosmetician who became the personal beauty adviser to Queen Elizabeth II for about 10 years from the mid-1940s. His paternal grandmother, Constance, had changed her and her children's surname to Holland (an old family name) in 1895, after Wilde had been convicted of homosexual acts and imprisoned, in order to gain some privacy for the boys and distance from the scandal.\n\nWork\nHolland has studied and researched Wilde's life for more than thirty years. He is the co-editor, with Rupert Hart-Davis, of The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde. He is the editor of Irish Peacock and Scarlet Marquess, the first uncensored version of his grandfather's 1895 trials.  (The book is titled The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde for release in the US.)Holland has criticised Richard Ellmann's 1987 biography, Oscar Wilde, as inaccurate, particularly his claim that Wilde had syphilis and transmitted it to Constance. According to The Guardian, Holland has  \"unearthed medical evidence within private family letters, which has enabled a doctor to determine the likely cause of Constance's death. The letters reveal symptoms nowadays associated with multiple sclerosis but apparently wrongly diagnosed by her two doctors. One, an unnamed German 'nerve doctor', resorted to dubious remedies and the other, Luigi Maria Bossi, conducted a botched operation that days later claimed her life.\"Holland has also written The Wilde Album, a small volume that included hitherto unpublished photographs of Wilde. The book focuses on how the scandal caused by Wilde's trials affected his family, most notably his wife, Constance, and their children, Cyril and Vyvyan.  \nIn 2006, his book Oscar Wilde: A Life in Letters was published, and his volume Coffee with Oscar Wilde, an imagined conversation with Wilde, was released in the autumn of 2007. Holland also wrote A Portrait of Oscar Wilde (2008), which reveals Wilde through manuscripts and letters from the Lucia Moreira Salles collection, located at The Morgan Library & Museum in New York City.In addition, Holland has also worked as a wine writer and occasionally written features for Country Life, and The Oldie.In July 2013, Holland gave the keynote address for a symposium on Oscar Wilde presented by The Santa Fe Opera. The address surveyed the popular and critical attitudes towards Wilde and his work from the end of his life to the present day. The symposium was given in conjunction with the opera company's world premiere presentations of Oscar, composed by Theodore Morrison with a libretto written by John Cox and the composer.Holland's play The Trials of Oscar Wilde, co-authored with John O'Connor and re-enacting the 1895 trials of Lord Queensberry for libel and Oscar Wilde for gross indecency, toured the United Kingdom in 2014 in a production by the European Arts Company.\n\nPersonal life\nHolland lives in Burgundy, France, with his second wife. His son, Lucian Holland (born 1979 to Merlin's first wife Sarah), studied classics at Magdalen College. He occupied rooms that his great-grandfather Wilde had occupied. He is a computer programmer, living in London.Merlin Holland briefly toyed with the idea of changing his name back to Wilde. He told The New York Times in 1998, \u201cBut if I did it, it would have to be not just for Oscar, but for his father and mother, too, for the whole family. It was an extraordinary family before he came along, so if I put the family name back on the map for the right reasons, then it's all right.\u201d\n\nPublished works\n1998 \u2013 The Wilde Album\n2003 \u2013 Irish Peacock and Scarlet Marquess: The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde\n2004 \u2013 The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde\nPassage 10:\nPrincess Elizabeth of Great Britain\nPrincess Elizabeth Caroline of Great Britain (10 January 1741 \u2013 4 September 1759) was one of the children of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. She was a granddaughter of King George II and sister of King George III.\n\nLife\nPrincess Elizabeth was born at Norfolk House, St James's Square, Westminster. Her father was The Prince Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of King George II and Caroline of Ansbach. Her mother was The Princess of Wales (n\u00e9e Augusta of Saxe-Gotha). She was christened twenty-five days later at Norfolk House, by The Bishop of Oxford, Thomas Secker \u2014 her godparents were The Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (her first cousin once-removed by marriage; for whom The Lord Baltimore (Gentleman of the Bedchamber to her father) stood proxy), The Queen of Denmark (for whom Anne, Viscountess Irwin stood proxy) and the Duchess of Saxe-Gotha (her maternal aunt by marriage, for whom Lady Jane Hamilton stood proxy).Little is known of her short life other than a fragment preserved in the Letters of Walpole.\n\nWe have lost another Princess, Lady Elizabeth.  She died of an inflammation in her bowels in two days.  Her figure was so very unfortunate, that it would have been difficult for her to be happy, but her parts and application were extraordinary.  I saw her act in \"Cato\" at eight years old, (when she could not stand alone, but was forced to lean against the side-scene,) better than any of her brothers and sisters.  She had been so unhealthy, that at that age she had not been taught to read, but had learned the part of Lucia by hearing the others study their parts. She went to her father and mother, and begged she might act. They put her off as gently as they could\u2014she desired leave to repeat her part, and when she did, it was with so much sense, that there was no denying her.\nShe died on 4 September 1759 at Kew Palace, London and was buried at Westminster Abbey.\n\nAncestors\nSee also\nList of British princesses\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

She started her career as a child actress. Later she appeared in lead actress and supporting actress roles. She has acted in over 300 films in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, and Bhojpuri languages. She won two Nandi Awards and one Filmfare Award.\n\nCareer\nTulasi made her debut in the Telugu language when she was three months old in 1967. For a song in a film, a baby was needed and Tulasi was placed in the cradle after actress Savitri had requested Tulasi's mother, who was a friend of her. She was featured in a song when she was three-and-half years old in Jeevanatarangalu and said that she became a full-fledged actor when she was four. She had never been to school.She got married at age 28 to Kannada director Sivamani. She stated, \"I met him in the morning and by evening we tied the knot\". They have one son, Sai Tarun. Tulasi decided to quit acting after getting married, working only occasionally as a voice actor in Telugu films, including ones by Mani Ratnam. When her son was around six years old, she received several mother character roles. She initially declined them all, but finally signed on one Kannada film, Excuse Me, in which she played mother to Divya Spandana and which became a big hit. After that she was doing three films a year in Kannada.\nShe began to act mainly in mother roles in Telugu and Tamil film industries. Her notable supporting roles include performances in Sasirekha Parinayam, Mr. Perfect, Darling, Srimanthudu, Iddarammayilatho, Nenu Local, Mahanati & Dear Comrade in Telugu and Pillaiyar Theru Kadaisi Veedu, Easan, Mankatha, Sundarapandian, Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer and Pandiya Naadu in Tamil. Tulasi has said that Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer, in which she had played mother to Manisha Yadav's character, changed her life and brought her an \"identity as a screen mother\". Her portrayal of Chellamma in Pannaiyarum Padminiyum was praised too, with critics stating that she was \"brilliant\", and had given her \"career best performance\".\n\nPartial filmography\nAwards\nNandi AwardsBest Child Actress - Seetamalakshmi (1978)\nBest Child Actress - Sankarabharanam (1980)Filmfare Awards SouthFilmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress - Kannada - Josh\nPassage 3:\nStokkseyrar-D\u00edsa\nThordis Markusdottir (\u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Mark\u00fasd\u00f3ttir), known as Stokkseyrar-D\u00edsa (1668\u20131728), was an Icelandic magician (Galdrmaster). She is known in history for her alleged magical powers. She is the subject of a least ten different folk sagas depicting her experiments within magic or Galdr.\nThordis Markusdottir belonged to the elite of the Iceland and was the grandchild of sheriff Torfi Erlendsson of Stafnes and related to Thormodus Torf\u00e6us, historian of the King of Denmark. She lived in Stokkseyri, thereby the name Stokkseyrar-D\u00edsa.

She was past normal child-bearing age when she conceived and gave birth to John.\n\nBiblical narrative\nAccording to the Gospel of Luke chapter 1, Elizabeth was \"of the daughters of Aaron\". She and her husband Zechariah/Zachariah were \"righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless\" (1:5\u20137), but childless. While he was in the temple of the Lord (1:8\u201312), Zachariah was visited by the angel Gabriel:\n\nBut the angel said to him: \u201cDo not be afraid, Zechariah; your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.\nZachariah doubted whereby he could know this since both he and his wife were old. The angel identified himself as Gabriel and told Zachariah that he would be \"dumb, and not able to speak\" until the words were fulfilled, because he did not believe. When the days of his ministry were complete, he returned to his house (Luke 1:16\u201323).\n\nAfter this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. \u201cThe Lord has done this for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIn these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.\u201d\nAccording to the account, the angel Gabriel was then sent to Nazareth in Galilee to her relative Mary, a virgin, betrothed to a man called Joseph, and informed her that she would conceive by the Holy Spirit and bring forth a son to be called Jesus. Mary was also informed that her \"relative Elizabeth\" had begun her sixth month of pregnancy, and Mary traveled to \"a town in the hill country of Judah\", to visit Elizabeth (Luke 1:26\u201340).\n\nWhen Elizabeth heard Mary\u2019s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!\"\nMatthew Henry comments, \"Mary knew that Elizabeth was with child, but it does not appear that Elizabeth had been told anything of her relative Mary's being designed for the mother of the Messiah; and therefore what knowledge she appears to have had of it must have come by a revelation, which would be a great encouragement to Mary.\" After Mary heard Elizabeth's blessing, she spoke the words now known as the Magnificat (Luke 1:46\u201355). \n\nMary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, but his mother spoke up and said, \u201cNo! He is to be called John.\u201dThey said to her, \u201cThere is no one among your relatives who has that name.\u201dThen they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone\u2019s astonishment he wrote, \u201cHis name is John.\u201d Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.\nThat is the last mention of Elizabeth, who is not mentioned in any other chapter in the Bible. The chapter continues with the prophecy of Zachariah (known as the Benedictus,) and ends with the note that John \"grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts\" until his ministry to Israel began; so it is unknown how long Elizabeth and her husband lived after that (Luke 1:65\u201380).\nSince the Medieval era, Elizabeth's greeting, \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,\" has formed the second part of the Hail Mary prayer.A traditional \"tomb of Elizabeth\" is shown in the Franciscan Monastery of Saint John in the Wilderness near Jerusalem.\n\nApocrypha\nElizabeth is mentioned in several books of the Apocrypha, most prominently in the Protevangelion of James, in which the birth of her son, the subsequent murder of her husband, as well as her and John's miraculous escape during the Massacre of the Innocents are chronicled.\n\nSainthood\nElizabeth is revered as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church on 5 November, and in the Orthodox and Anglican traditions on 5 September, on the same day with her husband Zacharias/Zechariah. She is commemorated as a matriarch in the Calendar of Saints (5 September) of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and Zacharias is commemorated as a prophet.She is also commemorated on 30 March in Eastern Orthodox Church (Visitation).\n\nIslam\nElizabeth (Arabic: Isha', daughter of Faqudh), the wife of Zakaria, the mother of Yahya, is an honored woman in Islam. Although Zachariah himself is frequently mentioned by name in the Qur'an, Elizabeth, while not mentioned by name, is referenced. She is revered by Muslims as a wise, pious and believing person who, like her relative Mary, was exalted by God to a high station. She lived in the household of Imran, and is said to have been a descendant of the prophet and priest Harun.Zachariah and his wife were both devout and steadfast in their duties. They were, however, both very old and they had no son. Therefore, Zachariah would frequently pray to God for a son. This was not only out of the desire to have a son but also because the great Jesus wanted someone to carry on the services of the Temple of prayer and to continue the preaching of the Lord's message before his death.\nGod cured Elizabeth's barrenness and granted Zachariah a son, Yahya (John the Baptist), who became a prophet. God thus granted the wishes of the couple because of their faith, trust and love for God. In the Qur'an, God speaks of Zachariah, his wife, and John, and describes the three as being humble servants of the Lord:\n\nSo We listened to him: and We granted him John: We cured his wife's (Barrenness) for him. These (three) were ever quick in emulation in good works; they used to call on Us with love and reverence, and humble themselves before Us.\nIn Sunni Islamic reports of al-Tabari and al-Masudi, Elizabeth is said to have been a daughter of Imran, and thus, a sister of Mary. Therefore, their children Jesus (Isa) and John (Yahya) are believed to have been cousins. In other accounts, Elizabeth is said to be a daughter of Fakudh, and a sister of Imran's wife Hannah.In Shia hadith she is named Hananah, and is identified as a sister of Mary's mother Hannah. Abu Basir recorded that Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, the great grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, had stated: \"Hannah, the wife of Imran, and Hananah, the wife of Zechariah, were sisters. He goes on to say that Mary was born from Hannah and John was born from Hananah. Mary gave birth to Jesus and he was the son of the daughter of John's aunt. John was the son of the aunt of Mary, and the aunt of one's mother is like one's aunt.\"\n\nMandaeism\nIn Mandaeism, Eni\u0161bai (Classical Mandaic: \u084f\u084d\u0849\u0854\u0841\u0840\u0849, romanized: \u02bfni\u0161bai) is the Mandaic name for Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. Eni\u0161bai is mentioned in chapters 18, 21, and 32 of the Mandaean Book of John.\n\nSee also\nGospel of Luke\nVisitation (Catholic feast)\nEin Kerem, traditional home town of Elizabeth, Zechariah and John\nBiblical figures in Islamic tradition\nSaint Elizabeth, patron saint archive\n\nNotes and references\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

The name of Sobe first appears in writings of about the 7th century by Hippolytus of Thebes, Andrew of Crete, and Epiphanius Monachus, and later in Nicephorus Callistus and Andronicus. All recount essentially the same passage, given by the last two as follows:\n\nThere were three sisters of Bethlehem, daughters of Matthan the priest, and Mary his wife, under the reign of Cleopatra and Sosipatrus, before the reign of Herod, the son of Antipater: the eldest was Mary, the second was Sobe, the youngest's name was Anne. The eldest being married in Bethlehem, had for daughter Salome the midwife; Sobe the second likewise married in Bethlehem, and was the mother of Elizabeth; last of all the third married in Galilee, and brought forth Mary the mother of Christ.\n\nThe 19th-century mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich claims that according to her visions (which give a detailed genealogy of Mary), Sobe was a sister of Anne, but the mother of Elizabeth was Emerentia, Sobe and Anne's maternal aunt.\n\nSee also\nList of names for the biblical nameless\nPassage 6:\nConstance Anne Herschel\nConstance Anne Herschel (1855 - 1939), later known as Lady Lubbock, was a scientist and mathematician.\nHerschel held the post of resident lecturer in natural sciences and mathematics at Girton College, Cambridge.She was the child of Sir John Frederick William Herschel, and the grandchild of William Herschel. She wrote a family history of the famous scientific dynasty by compiling family sources, 'The Herschel Chronicle'.She married Sir Neville Lubbock.\nPassage 7:\nAlbina du Boisrouvray\nCountess Albina du Boisrouvray (born 1941) is a former journalist and film producer who has become a global philanthropist and social entrepreneur working with AIDS victims and impoverished communities around the world. She is the founder of FXB International, a non-governmental organization established in memory of her son, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud.Du Boisrouvray is a grandchild of the Bolivian King of Tin, Sim\u00f3n Pati\u00f1o.

She worked as a freelance journalist for Le Nouvel Observateur, covering international stories such as the death of Che Guevara. She later co-founded the literary magazine Libre with Juan Goytisolo.In 1978, du Boisrouvray ran as a candidate for the Friends of the Earth party in parliamentary elections.She founded a film production company, Albina Productions, in 1969 and is credited with producing 22 films over a period of 17 years. These films include Pascal Thomas' first film, Les Zozos (1972), L'important c'est d'aimer and Une Femme a sa fen\u00eatre, both of which starred Romy Schneider, and Fort Saganne (1984), directed by Alain Corneau and starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Catherine Deneuve and Sophie Marceau. Police Python 357 (1976) notably was one of the few films which starred Yves Montand and Simone Signoret, a well-known couple, in the same film. Du Boisrouvray began serving as the chairperson of SEGH, her family's real estate and hotel management group, in 1980.\n\nFXB International\nFollowing the death of her only child, du Boisrouvray sold three-quarters of her assets including a jewelry collection auctioned by Sotheby's in New York for $31.2 million, an art collection of $20 million, and a substantial part of her family real-estate business which garnered $50 million. The Sotheby's auction was the largest jewelry sale since the Duchess of Windsor's auction. The sale included pre-Columbian gold, jade and other notable pieces accumulated by the noble French family. Du Boisrouvray allocated part of the profits to the FXB Foundation to create programs, including an at home palliative care program for the terminally ill in Switzerland and France, a rescue helicopter control centre in the Swiss Alps, and a professorship at the University of Michigan (her son's alma mater). The rest of the funds were used to found FXB International in memory of her son, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud, a search-and-rescue pilot who died while serving as a transport pilot in Mali during the Paris-Dakar rally in 1986.Du Boisrouvray founded FXB International is to fight poverty and AIDS, and support orphans and vulnerable children left in the wake of the AIDS pandemic. FXB International offers comprehensive support to the families and communities that care for these children, and advocates for their fundamental rights. The organization has helped over 17 million people from programs in more than 100 countries, with a staff of over 450. Du Boisrouvray broadened its work from supporting children impacted by AIDS to also include all families needing support to emerge from extreme poverty and become self-sufficient through the FXBVillage methodology. In 1991, she developed the FXBVillage Methodology, a community-based, sustainable approach to overcoming the AIDS orphans crisis and extreme poverty. Each FXBVillage supports 80-100 families, comprising approximately 500 individuals, mostly children. Over a three-year period, FXB provides communities with the resources and training needed to become physically, financially and socially independent. According to FXB, the FXBVillage program has graduated over 69,500 participants from eight countries and has over 12,500 current participants.In 1993, du Boisrouvray founded the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University, the first academic center to focus exclusively on health and human rights.\n\nAwards and recognition\nDu Boisrouvray was made Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres in 1985.

He is the only grandchild of Oscar Wilde, whose life he has researched and written about extensively.\n\nBiography\nBorn in London in December 1945, Christopher Merlin Vyvyan Holland is the son of the author Vyvyan Holland and his second wife, Thelma Besant. He is the only grandchild of Oscar Wilde and Constance Lloyd.His mother Thelma was an Australian cosmetician who became the personal beauty adviser to Queen Elizabeth II for about 10 years from the mid-1940s. His paternal grandmother, Constance, had changed her and her children's surname to Holland (an old family name) in 1895, after Wilde had been convicted of homosexual acts and imprisoned, in order to gain some privacy for the boys and distance from the scandal.\n\nWork\nHolland has studied and researched Wilde's life for more than thirty years. He is the co-editor, with Rupert Hart-Davis, of The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde. He is the editor of Irish Peacock and Scarlet Marquess, the first uncensored version of his grandfather's 1895 trials.  (The book is titled The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde for release in the US.)Holland has criticised Richard Ellmann's 1987 biography, Oscar Wilde, as inaccurate, particularly his claim that Wilde had syphilis and transmitted it to Constance. According to The Guardian, Holland has  \"unearthed medical evidence within private family letters, which has enabled a doctor to determine the likely cause of Constance's death. The letters reveal symptoms nowadays associated with multiple sclerosis but apparently wrongly diagnosed by her two doctors. One, an unnamed German 'nerve doctor', resorted to dubious remedies and the other, Luigi Maria Bossi, conducted a botched operation that days later claimed her life.\"Holland has also written The Wilde Album, a small volume that included hitherto unpublished photographs of Wilde. The book focuses on how the scandal caused by Wilde's trials affected his family, most notably his wife, Constance, and their children, Cyril and Vyvyan.  \nIn 2006, his book Oscar Wilde: A Life in Letters was published, and his volume Coffee with Oscar Wilde, an imagined conversation with Wilde, was released in the autumn of 2007. Holland also wrote A Portrait of Oscar Wilde (2008), which reveals Wilde through manuscripts and letters from the Lucia Moreira Salles collection, located at The Morgan Library & Museum in New York City.In addition, Holland has also worked as a wine writer and occasionally written features for Country Life, and The Oldie.In July 2013, Holland gave the keynote address for a symposium on Oscar Wilde presented by The Santa Fe Opera. The address surveyed the popular and critical attitudes towards Wilde and his work from the end of his life to the present day. The symposium was given in conjunction with the opera company's world premiere presentations of Oscar, composed by Theodore Morrison with a libretto written by John Cox and the composer.Holland's play The Trials of Oscar Wilde, co-authored with John O'Connor and re-enacting the 1895 trials of Lord Queensberry for libel and Oscar Wilde for gross indecency, toured the United Kingdom in 2014 in a production by the European Arts Company.\n\nPersonal life\nHolland lives in Burgundy, France, with his second wife. His son, Lucian Holland (born 1979 to Merlin's first wife Sarah), studied classics at Magdalen College. He occupied rooms that his great-grandfather Wilde had occupied. He is a computer programmer, living in London.Merlin Holland briefly toyed with the idea of changing his name back to Wilde. He told The New York Times in 1998, \u201cBut if I did it, it would have to be not just for Oscar, but for his father and mother, too, for the whole family. It was an extraordinary family before he came along, so if I put the family name back on the map for the right reasons, then it's all right.\u201d\n\nPublished works\n1998 \u2013 The Wilde Album\n2003 \u2013 Irish Peacock and Scarlet Marquess: The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde\n2004 \u2013 The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde\nPassage 10:\nPrincess Elizabeth of Great Britain\nPrincess Elizabeth Caroline of Great Britain (10 January 1741 \u2013 4 September 1759) was one of the children of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. She was a granddaughter of King George II and sister of King George III.\n\nLife\nPrincess Elizabeth was born at Norfolk House, St James's Square, Westminster. Her father was The Prince Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of King George II and Caroline of Ansbach. Her mother was The Princess of Wales (n\u00e9e Augusta of Saxe-Gotha). She was christened twenty-five days later at Norfolk House, by The Bishop of Oxford, Thomas Secker \u2014 her godparents were The Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (her first cousin once-removed by marriage; for whom The Lord Baltimore (Gentleman of the Bedchamber to her father) stood proxy), The Queen of Denmark (for whom Anne, Viscountess Irwin stood proxy) and the Duchess of Saxe-Gotha (her maternal aunt by marriage, for whom Lady Jane Hamilton stood proxy).Little is known of her short life other than a fragment preserved in the Letters of Walpole.\n\nWe have lost another Princess, Lady Elizabeth.  She died of an inflammation in her bowels in two days.  Her figure was so very unfortunate, that it would have been difficult for her to be happy, but her parts and application were extraordinary.  I saw her act in \"Cato\" at eight years old, (when she could not stand alone, but was forced to lean against the side-scene,) better than any of her brothers and sisters.  She had been so unhealthy, that at that age she had not been taught to read, but had learned the part of Lucia by hearing the others study their parts. She went to her father and mother, and begged she might act. They put her off as gently as they could\u2014she desired leave to repeat her part, and when she did, it was with so much sense, that there was no denying her.\nShe died on 4 September 1759 at Kew Palace, London and was buried at Westminster Abbey.\n\nAncestors\nSee also\nList of British princesses", "answers": ["John the Baptist"], "pred": " Sobe (Sister Of Sane Sane Sane Sane Sane Sane Sane Sane Sane Sane Sane Sane Sane", "length": 4776, "dataset": "2wikimqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3924e4ac5039ce3fadda49604bfcb0f5238af81774616e53"}

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nSelect credits\nWaiting for Lucas (1973) (short)\nStone (1974) (editor only)\nThe Chain Reaction (1980)\nWhose Baby?

After moving to Paris in 1995, he wrote articles in Les Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. He started writing soon after. His 1996 book Tout contre L\u00e9o (Close to Leo) talks about HIV and is aimed at young adults; he made it into a film in 2002. He wrote other books for young adults throughout the late 1990s. His first play, Les D\u00e9butantes, was performed at Avignon's Off Festival in 1998. In 2005, he returned to Avignon to present Dionysos impuissant in the \"In\" Festival, with Joana Preiss and Louis Garrel playing the leads.\nA well-known director, he is considered an \"auteur\" in French cinema. His 2006 film Dans Paris has led him to be considered by French critics as the heir to the Nouvelle Vague cinema. In 2007, Les Chansons d'amour was one of the films selected to be in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Honor\u00e9 is openly gay, and some of his movies or screenplays (among them Les Filles ne savent pas nager, Dix-sept fois C\u00e9cile Cassard and Les Chansons d'amour) deal with gay or lesbian relations. His film Plaire, aimer et courir vite (Sorry Angel), about a writer who has contracted HIV in the 1990s, won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in 2018. Honor\u00e9 has been the screenwriter for some of Ga\u00ebl Morel's films. The actors Louis Garrel and Chiara Mastroianni have each had roles in several of his films.\nHonor\u00e9 has also directed several operas for the stage. For the Op\u00e9ra de Lyon he directed Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites in 2013,  Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande in 2015, and Verdi's Don Carlos in 2018. He also presented his production of Mozart's Cos\u00ec fan tutte at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and the Edinburgh Festival in 2016, and Puccini's Tosca at Aix-en-Provence in 2019; both of these productions adopted a radical approach to traditional works.In the summer of 2020 Honor\u00e9's rehearsals of his stage production of Le C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Guermantes, based on the third volume of Proust's In Search of Lost Time, were interrupted by restrictions to combat the COVID-19 epidemic and it became impossible to present it at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise as planned. With his troupe of actors he decided to make a film about the production and the uncertainties they were now facing, and the film Guermantes was released in September 2021.\n\nFilmography\nNovels\n1995 : Tout contre L\u00e9o (jeunesse), turned into a film in 2002\n1996 : C'est plus fort que moi (jeunesse)\n1997 : Je joue tr\u00e8s bien tout seul (jeunesse)\n1997 : L'Affaire petit Marcel (jeunesse)\n1997 : L\u2019Infamille (\u00c9ditions de l'Olivier, ISBN 2-87929-143-7)\n1998 : Z\u00e9ro de lecture (jeunesse)\n1998 : Une toute petite histoire d'amour (jeunesse)\n1998 : Je ne suis pas une fille \u00e0 papa (jeunesse)\n1999 : Les Nuits o\u00f9 personne ne dort (jeunesse)\n1999 : Mon c\u0153ur boulevers\u00e9  (jeunesse)\n1999 : Bretonneries (jeunesse)\n1999 : La Douceur (\u00c9ditions de L'Olivier, ISBN 2-87929-236-0)\n\nTheatre and opera\nActor\n1998: Les D\u00e9butantes\n2001: Le Pire du troupeau\n2004: Beautiful Guys\n2005: Dionysos impuissant\n2012: La Facult\u00e9\n2012: Un jeune se tue\n2012: Nouveau Roman\n2015: Violentes femmes\n\nDirector\n2009 : Angelo, Tyrant of Padua by Victor Hugo, Festival d'Avignon\n2012 : Nouveau Roman, Festival d'Avignon, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de la Colline\n2013 : Dialogues of the Carmelites by Francis Poulenc, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\n2015 : Fin de l'Histoire by Witold Gombrowicz, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Lorient\n2015 : Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande by Claude Debussy, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\n2016 : Cos\u00ec fan tutte by Mozart, Aix-en-Provence Festival and Edinburgh International Festival\n2018 : Don Carlos by Verdi, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\n2019 : Les Idoles by Christophe Honor\u00e9, Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Europe\n2019 : Tosca by Puccini, Aix-en-Provence Festival\nPassage 8:\nMan at Bath\nMan at Bath (French: Homme au bain) is a 2010 French film by Christophe Honor\u00e9 starring Fran\u00e7ois Sagat and Chiara Mastroianni. The film premiered in competition at Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland in 2010 and was released in cinemas on 22 September 2010.\nThis is gay pornographic actor Fran\u00e7ois Sagat's second major role in general release non-pornographic film as Emmanuel after his role in L.A. Zombie. Director Christopher Honor\u00e9 told French gay website Yagg.com that he was interested in Sagat because he \"redefines the notion of masculinity\". Sagat was the only actor to feature in two competition entries during the festival.\n\nPlot\nRight before departing to New York colleges to promote his latest collaborations, Omar (Omar Ben Sellem) goes through yet another impulsive fit from his boyfriend Emmanuel (Fran\u00e7ois Sagat), resulting in rape. Resentful, Omar demands Emmanuel to be gone from his flat located in the outskirts of Paris before his return, and leaves. The two set out to live a separate series of vignettes depicting the ways the former lovers' mourn for each other.\nBeing a lustful, aspiring filmmaker, Omar sees his touring in upper New York as an opportunity to finally forget Emmanuel, indulging instead in disjointed recordings of his travel. Soon after, his camera work is centered on Dustin (Dustin Segura-Suarez): a young college student who is on vacation from Canada. Omar eagerly befriends and later seduces Dustin, openly portraying their desire for each other on film with an amateurish academic intent. In a matter of days, the artistic intentions in Omar's house movie devolve into a bisexual experience including Omar's professor.\nBack in Paris, an animalistic Emmanuel - used to take pride on the universal praise for his body - is left broke and in denial. He resorts instead to shelter himself in Omar's place, living as carefree days as he can muster. Emmanuel goes from demanding unsolicited attentions from an upstairs neighbor who also is one of his clients as a hustler (Dennis Cooper), to hosting sexual encounters with Omar's acquaintances. All without avoiding his growing yearning for the better days with his ex, not even after luring an Omar's look-alike (Sebastian D'Azeglio) back into the apartment. After an intermission in which Emmanuel is confronted with his own collapsing lack of emotionality, he then clumsily refuses the advances of an underage boy who claims to be in need (Andr\u00e9as Leflamand), nor engages in a bisexual threesome in exchange for a tip he reluctantly accepts from a successful old friend (Kate Moran). The next day, Emmanuel begrudgingly succumbs to the advances from a teenager (Rabah Zahi), and uses the opportunity to sexually lash out on the boy. Finally, shortly before Omar's return, Emmanuel cries over the improvised mural he started days earlier on one of the walls in the apartment.\nNot long after, Omar enters back into his apartment, stopping to contemplate the finished mural drawn by Emmanuel, who is nowhere to be seen.\n\nCast\nFran\u00e7ois Sagat as Emmanuel\nChiara Mastroianni as Actress\nRabah Zahi as Rabah\nOmar Ben Sellem as Omar\nKate Moran as Kate\nLahcen el Mazouzi as Hicham\nAndr\u00e9as Leflamand as Andr\u00e9as\nRonald Piwele as Ronald\nSebastian D'Azeglio as Man with a moustache\nS\u00e9bastien Pouderoux as Kate's fianc\u00e9\nDennis Cooper as Robin\nDustin Segura-Suarez\nPassage 9:\nPaul Scheuring\nPaul T. Scheuring (born November 20, 1968) is an American screenwriter and director of films and television shows. His work includes the 2003 film A Man Apart and the creation of the television drama Prison Break, for which he was also credited as an executive producer and head writer.\n\nEarly life\nScheuring was born in Aurora, Illinois. Before his success, he had attended the UCLA School of Theater Film and Television and has worked as a courier cable installer and factory worker.\n\nCareer\nAfter working on 36K in 2000 and A Man Apart in 2003, Scheuring made his first attempt to be a television show writer. After developing an idea given to him by a female colleague into a miniseries screenplay called Prison Break, he approached the Fox network with the script but was turned down due to its unconventional storyline.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

After moving to Paris in 1995, he wrote articles in Les Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. He started writing soon after. His 1996 book Tout contre L\u00e9o (Close to Leo) talks about HIV and is aimed at young adults; he made it into a film in 2002. He wrote other books for young adults throughout the late 1990s. His first play, Les D\u00e9butantes, was performed at Avignon's Off Festival in 1998. In 2005, he returned to Avignon to present Dionysos impuissant in the \"In\" Festival, with Joana Preiss and Louis Garrel playing the leads.\nA well-known director, he is considered an \"auteur\" in French cinema. His 2006 film Dans Paris has led him to be considered by French critics as the heir to the Nouvelle Vague cinema. In 2007, Les Chansons d'amour was one of the films selected to be in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Honor\u00e9 is openly gay, and some of his movies or screenplays (among them Les Filles ne savent pas nager, Dix-sept fois C\u00e9cile Cassard and Les Chansons d'amour) deal with gay or lesbian relations. His film Plaire, aimer et courir vite (Sorry Angel), about a writer who has contracted HIV in the 1990s, won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in 2018. Honor\u00e9 has been the screenwriter for some of Ga\u00ebl Morel's films. The actors Louis Garrel and Chiara Mastroianni have each had roles in several of his films.\nHonor\u00e9 has also directed several operas for the stage. For the Op\u00e9ra de Lyon he directed Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites in 2013,  Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande in 2015, and Verdi's Don Carlos in 2018. He also presented his production of Mozart's Cos\u00ec fan tutte at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and the Edinburgh Festival in 2016, and Puccini's Tosca at Aix-en-Provence in 2019; both of these productions adopted a radical approach to traditional works.In the summer of 2020 Honor\u00e9's rehearsals of his stage production of Le C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Guermantes, based on the third volume of Proust's In Search of Lost Time, were interrupted by restrictions to combat the COVID-19 epidemic and it became impossible to present it at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise as planned. With his troupe of actors he decided to make a film about the production and the uncertainties they were now facing, and the film Guermantes was released in September 2021.\n\nFilmography\nNovels\n1995 : Tout contre L\u00e9o (jeunesse), turned into a film in 2002\n1996 : C'est plus fort que moi (jeunesse)\n1997 : Je joue tr\u00e8s bien tout seul (jeunesse)\n1997 : L'Affaire petit Marcel (jeunesse)\n1997 : L\u2019Infamille (\u00c9ditions de l'Olivier, ISBN 2-87929-143-7)\n1998 : Z\u00e9ro de lecture (jeunesse)\n1998 : Une toute petite histoire d'amour (jeunesse)\n1998 : Je ne suis pas une fille \u00e0 papa (jeunesse)\n1999 : Les Nuits o\u00f9 personne ne dort (jeunesse)\n1999 : Mon c\u0153ur boulevers\u00e9  (jeunesse)\n1999 : Bretonneries (jeunesse)\n1999 : La Douceur (\u00c9ditions de L'Olivier, ISBN 2-87929-236-0)\n\nTheatre and opera\nActor\n1998: Les D\u00e9butantes\n2001: Le Pire du troupeau\n2004: Beautiful Guys\n2005: Dionysos impuissant\n2012: La Facult\u00e9\n2012: Un jeune se tue\n2012: Nouveau Roman\n2015: Violentes femmes\n\nDirector\n2009 : Angelo, Tyrant of Padua by Victor Hugo, Festival d'Avignon\n2012 : Nouveau Roman, Festival d'Avignon, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de la Colline\n2013 : Dialogues of the Carmelites by Francis Poulenc, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\n2015 : Fin de l'Histoire by Witold Gombrowicz, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Lorient\n2015 : Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande by Claude Debussy, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\n2016 : Cos\u00ec fan tutte by Mozart, Aix-en-Provence Festival and Edinburgh International Festival\n2018 : Don Carlos by Verdi, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\n2019 : Les Idoles by Christophe Honor\u00e9, Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Europe\n2019 : Tosca by Puccini, Aix-en-Provence Festival\nPassage 8:\nMan at Bath\nMan at Bath (French: Homme au bain) is a 2010 French film by Christophe Honor\u00e9 starring Fran\u00e7ois Sagat and Chiara Mastroianni.

Zombie. Director Christopher Honor\u00e9 told French gay website Yagg.com that he was interested in Sagat because he \"redefines the notion of masculinity\". Sagat was the only actor to feature in two competition entries during the festival.\n\nPlot\nRight before departing to New York colleges to promote his latest collaborations, Omar (Omar Ben Sellem) goes through yet another impulsive fit from his boyfriend Emmanuel (Fran\u00e7ois Sagat), resulting in rape. Resentful, Omar demands Emmanuel to be gone from his flat located in the outskirts of Paris before his return, and leaves. The two set out to live a separate series of vignettes depicting the ways the former lovers' mourn for each other.\nBeing a lustful, aspiring filmmaker, Omar sees his touring in upper New York as an opportunity to finally forget Emmanuel, indulging instead in disjointed recordings of his travel. Soon after, his camera work is centered on Dustin (Dustin Segura-Suarez): a young college student who is on vacation from Canada. Omar eagerly befriends and later seduces Dustin, openly portraying their desire for each other on film with an amateurish academic intent. In a matter of days, the artistic intentions in Omar's house movie devolve into a bisexual experience including Omar's professor.\nBack in Paris, an animalistic Emmanuel - used to take pride on the universal praise for his body - is left broke and in denial. He resorts instead to shelter himself in Omar's place, living as carefree days as he can muster. Emmanuel goes from demanding unsolicited attentions from an upstairs neighbor who also is one of his clients as a hustler (Dennis Cooper), to hosting sexual encounters with Omar's acquaintances. All without avoiding his growing yearning for the better days with his ex, not even after luring an Omar's look-alike (Sebastian D'Azeglio) back into the apartment. After an intermission in which Emmanuel is confronted with his own collapsing lack of emotionality, he then clumsily refuses the advances of an underage boy who claims to be in need (Andr\u00e9as Leflamand), nor engages in a bisexual threesome in exchange for a tip he reluctantly accepts from a successful old friend (Kate Moran). The next day, Emmanuel begrudgingly succumbs to the advances from a teenager (Rabah Zahi), and uses the opportunity to sexually lash out on the boy. Finally, shortly before Omar's return, Emmanuel cries over the improvised mural he started days earlier on one of the walls in the apartment.\nNot long after, Omar enters back into his apartment, stopping to contemplate the finished mural drawn by Emmanuel, who is nowhere to be seen.\n\nCast\nFran\u00e7ois Sagat as Emmanuel\nChiara Mastroianni as Actress\nRabah Zahi as Rabah\nOmar Ben Sellem as Omar\nKate Moran as Kate\nLahcen el Mazouzi as Hicham\nAndr\u00e9as Leflamand as Andr\u00e9as\nRonald Piwele as Ronald\nSebastian D'Azeglio as Man with a moustache\nS\u00e9bastien Pouderoux as Kate's fianc\u00e9\nDennis Cooper as Robin\nDustin Segura-Suarez\nPassage 9:\nPaul Scheuring\nPaul T.

Hall served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives for a total of 28 years, serving non-consecutively from 1970 until 2008.\nHall grew up in New York City, where she attended Barnard College. In 1948, she and her husband moved to the town of Brookline, New Hampshire, where they started a textile manufacturing firm. Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, Hall began participating in local politics, serving on several boards and commissions in Brookline. Hall was elected to the Brookline school board in 1963, and in 1972, she was elected to the town board of selectmen.\nHall's career in statewide politics began in 1970 when she was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. In 1986, Hall switched her party affiliation to the Democratic Party, citing the Republican Party's shift towards conservatism during the Reagan Era. During her political career, Hall was described as a firebrand who frequently bucked her party. While a Republican, Hall was seen as a liberal member of that party, and was considered to be a political enemy by conservative leaders. In the Democratic Party, Hall was a member of the grassroots base, challenging the party's establishment in a 2007 campaign for chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\nIn the 2000s, Hall became nationally known for her activism. In 2004, she was arrested for disorderly conduct for her participation in a protest against President George W. Bush; she was later acquitted of the charge. In 2008, Hall introduced New Hampshire House Resolution 24, which would have petitioned the United States Congress to introduce articles to impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their actions leading to and during the Iraq War. While the bill ultimately failed, it generated a large amount of media coverage.\n\nPre-political life and career\nEarly life and education\nBeatrice Perin Barker was born on March 18, 1921, in Koblenz, Germany, where her father Joseph Warren Barker, a United States Army officer, served as the administrator of a military district following World War I. After leaving the military, Barker's father completed his education in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving an academic position at the institution. He later became the Dean of Engineering at Columbia University, and she primarily grew up in New York City. This led to Barker's entry into academia, as her father's position at Columbia University brought prominent scientists such as Enrico Fermi and Harold Urey to their home for dinner where Barker would serve as a hostess. In 1937, her mother Mary died when Barker was 16.Barker attended the Horace Mann School and later studied engineering at Barnard College. Barker would later do graduate work at the University of New Hampshire, Boston University, and the College of the Holy Cross.\n\nFamily and career\nAfter graduating from Barnard College in 1943, Barker worked as an engineer at Western Electric. During World War II, she helped manufacture vacuum tubes for radar equipment, and her father served as a special assistant to Frank Knox, the United States Secretary of the Navy.On May 27, 1944, she married Sidney Leavitt Hall, an engineer from Concord, New Hampshire, leaving her job at Western Electric to join her husband in Ohio, where he was undergoing training with the United States Air Force in order to fight in World War II. However, the war ended before he was sent overseas, and in 1948, the couple moved to Brookline, New Hampshire, a town of 800 people in Hillsborough County. Hall's grandmother, Florence Hobart Perin, was a resident of Brookline, and Hall had frequently visited and spent several summers in the town during her youth. Sidney Hall initially worked at Textron, and in 1951, the couple started a textile manufacturing firm called Hall Manufacturing Company, which was informally known as Hall Tote Bags. The company produced stitching for dry-cleaners, as well as steam air covers for dry-cleaning machines. Later, the company became locally famous for the tote bags they produced, as well as other stitched products. Hall and her husband were members of the local Church of Christ, and she was credited with uniting the Brookline Methodist and Congregationalist churches into one single church.In 1957, Hall received a fellowship from the National Science Foundation. Hall served as the assistant manager for Hall Manufacturing Co. until 1962, whereupon she became a science and mathematics teacher in Groton, Massachusetts. Hall transferred to Fairgrounds Junior High School in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1964, and taught mathematics there until 1972. In 1968, Hall was awarded a grant by the Research Corporation for Science Advancement in order to start an experimental \"Mathematics Learning Laboratory\" at her school. She had also been invited to academic conferences, such as the Advanced Modern Math Institute, which was sponsored by Science Research Associates.Sidney Hall died in 1987 at the age of 66. Hall and her husband had 4 sons and 1 daughter. One of their sons, Sidney Hall Jr., is a locally-known author.  Following her husband's death, Hall solely ran Hall Manufacturing Co., and the company was featured in a White House symposium on small businesses in 1994. Hall Manufacturing Co. closed in 2001.\n\nEarly political career\nLocal politics\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Hall became very active in local politics, serving on numerous boards and committees in Brookline, including the board of assessors and the town finance committee. In 1961, Hall was defeated in an election for Brookline library trustee. In 1963, Hall was elected unopposed to the Brookline school board. She was re-elected in 1966, defeating future state representative Eben Bartlett and another candidate. In 1969, Hall was re-elected for her third and final term on the school board. She served as the chairman of the school board from 1964 until 1968 and again in 1971. She served a total of 9 years on the school board.In 1967, Hall ran for the Brookline board of selectmen; however, she was defeated by Walter W. Frost, receiving 138 votes to Frost's 152. In 1972, Hall served as the chairman of the Brookline Republican Town Committee. Later that year, Hall again ran for the Brookline board of selectmen to succeed the retiring Grover C. Farwell, defeating two candidates to win a three-year term as selectman. Following her election to the board of selectmen, Hall did not seek another term for the school board and resigned as a teacher. In 1974, Hall served as the chairman of the board of selectmen.\n\nEarly 1970s\nIn 1970, Hall ran for the New Hampshire House of Representatives in Hillsborough County's 13th district as a member of the Republican Party. Hall had decided to run for state office because she \"realized she was not accomplishing what she wanted to\" in local office. She was recruited to run by Governor Walter R. Peterson Jr. Hall and fellow Republican Daniel Brocklebank were elected with 43% and 41% of the vote, respectively. In 1972, Hall ran for re-election in Hillsborough County's 12th district, and was elected unopposed alongside fellow Republican Jack Boyd. During the 1970s, Hall held multiple positions in the local Republican Party, serving as a member of the Republican state committee the Hillsborough County Republican Party Executive Committee.\n\n1974 state senate campaign\nIn 1974, Hall ran for the 12th district of the New Hampshire Senate, running to replace retiring Republican incumbent Frederick A. Porter. In the Republican primary, Hall faced fellow state representative D. Alan Rock, as well as Milford town selectman Frederic Fletcher, a former state senator and former member of the Executive Council. During the primary, Hall campaigned via bicycle, cycling a total of 1,000 miles through the 26 towns in the district. Hall won the primary election, narrowly defeating Rock. Despite Hall placing second in her hometown of Brookline and only winning two towns, Amherst and Hollis, both towns gave her large margins. Additionally, she placed second in nearly every other town in the district, offsetting the large margin by which Rock won in Nashua. Official sources conflict on the final vote tally: the New Hampshire General Court officially reported that Hall received 1,544 votes, Rock received 1,485 votes, and Fletcher received 1,198 votes, giving Hall a winning margin of just 59 votes. However, a recount found that the margin was actually 114 votes in favor of Hall, with the town of Amherst alone overcounting 50 ballots in favor of Rock; however, the results of the recount are not officially recorded. Hall's campaign expenditure for the primary was $1,470.While there was no official Democratic Party candidate running in the heavily Republican district, both Hall and Rock also contested the Democratic primary as write-in candidates. Rock won the Democratic write-in nomination, with official sources again conflicting on the tally: the New Hampshire General Court reported that Rock received 72 votes to Hall's 71, a margin of just one vote, while a recount reportedly increased Rock's margin to 3 votes.During the general election campaign, Rock was heavily supported by William Loeb III, the publisher of the Manchester Union Leader, an influential conservative newspaper. Rock frequently used the newspaper's front page to promote his campaign. While Hall was endorsed by the Nashua Telegraph, her campaign did not have the media capabilities that Rock's did, and Rock ultimately won the general election, defeating Hall by a margin of 53% to 47%. Judd Gregg, then the chairman of the Nashua Republican Party, alleged that the party's campaign literature had been tampered with; specifically, Gregg alleged that an individual had switched out Hall's campaign literature from several envelopes and replaced it with Rock's campaign literature before they were sent out to voters in Nashua. However, Hall stated that she did not believe the incident had influenced the end result of the election. Hall was succeeded in the state house by Republican Dorothy Foss Colson.\n\nLate 1970s and early 1980s\nIn 1975, Hall became the chairman of the New Hampshire branch of Common Cause, a lobbying group that opposes corruption and promotes campaign finance reform. In this role, Hall advocated for good government. In the 1976 presidential election, Hall criticized Republican candidate Ronald Reagan and independent candidate Eugene McCarthy for being the only two major candidates who had not agreed to the campaign standards proposed by Common Cause. She later criticized all the presidential candidates for not discussing the costs of the programs they propose. Hall left the position in September 1977.In 1978, Hall was elected back to the New Hampshire House of Representatives for Hillsborough County's 12th district. Hall and fellow Republican Eliot B. Ware won with 36% and 31% of the vote. Hall and Ware were re-elected unopposed in 1980.In November 1980, Rock, who had still serving as the state senator for the 12th district, died of cancer just three days after winning re-election. Hall was one of four candidates vying for the Republican nomination for the February 1981 special election; instead of being elected in a primary election, the party nominee was instead to be selected by delegates of the Hillsborough County Republican Party. Hall's campaign for the nomination was heavily opposed by Robert B. Monier, the influential Republican president of the New Hampshire Senate, who viewed Hall as a political opponent. Monier instead supported John Stabile, a Nashua businessman and the New Hampshire campaign chair for John Connally's 1980 presidential campaign. The other Republican candidates were state representatives Joanne Head, Philip Labombarde, and Emma Wheeler. Despite an initial convention ending in deadlock, with 9 delegates voting for Hall and the other 9 for Stabile, the party reconvened and ultimately selected Stabile to be the Republican nominee. Stabile would go on to defeat Democratic state representative Selma Pastor and independent candidate Mark Knox, a Nashua alderman, in the special election.In 1982, Hall ran for the 11th district of the New Hampshire Senate to replace retiring Republican incumbent Arthur Mann. Hall placed third in the Republican primary, losing to fellow state representative Jean T. White; Hall received 29% of the vote, while White received 40%. The second-place candidate, state representative Richard Amidon, received 31% of the vote. However, Hall won the Democratic nomination as a write-in candidate, receiving 199 votes compared to White's 81 and Amidon's 55. Hall was defeated by White in the general election, receiving 4,668 votes to White's 6,632.\n\nParty switch and later political career\nLate 1980s and 1990s\nIn 1986, Hall switched to the Democratic Party, citing the Republican Party's shift towards conservatism. That year, Hall ran as a Democrat for the state house in Hillsborough County's 16th district. Hall defeated incumbent Republican state representative Barbara Fried, who had been facing charges of embezzlement after it was revealed she used her position as Greenville town clerk to embezzle $10,000 in fees. Hall received 642 votes, while Fried received 555. Hall was narrowly re-elected in 1988, defeating Republican candidate Shirley A. Morley by just 54 votes out of 2,274 cast. Hall was re-elected in 1990, defeating former Republican state representative Webster E. Bridges, 56% to 44%.In 1992, Hall ran for re-election in Hillsborough County's 20th district. Hall and Republican Thomas I. Arnold were elected, receiving 1,488 votes and 1,384 votes, respectively. Hall and Arnold had previously served together on the Brookline school board in the 1960s, where Arnold was the school board's moderator. The two were re-elected unopposed in 1994. In 1996, they were again re-elected, with Hall receiving 46% of the vote and Arnold receiving 36%. In 1996, Hall served as the chairman of the Hillsborough County Democratic Party. In 1998, Hall and Arnold were again re-elected. Arnold received 1,063 votes, while Hall received 1,001.Hall was an early supporter of Bill Clinton in the 1992 United States presidential election, and was a delegate for Clinton at the 1996 Democratic Party convention. Hall also praised Richard Lugar during the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries, supporting his tax policy and stating that he seemed honest.\n\n2000s\nIn 2000, Hall and Arnold were re-elected unopposed. In 2002, Hall ran for re-election in Hillsborough County's 46th district. However, Hall was defeated in the general election, placing fifth with 12% of the vote.In 2004, Hall was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct at a protest against President George W. Bush in Nashua. Hall, who was 83 at the time, was sitting in a chair outside the designated area for protestors, and was close to the presidential motorcade route. Hall was also holding a sign that said, \"Bush is bad for America\". After Hall refused to move, three police officers picked Hall up, \"chair, cane, and all\", carrying her away and arresting her. A photographer captured the arrest, and the incident became national news. Hall was acquitted in September 2004 after Nashua District Court judge Clifford Kinghorn ruled that the evidence provided did not fit the charge of disorderly conduct; Kinghorn stated that \"the police had no authority under state law to make Hall move because she wasn't getting in their way\". Hall also explained that she had originally written the law that was being applied to her case.Later in 2004, Hall ran again for the state house for Hillsborough County's 5th district. Hall won, placing fourth with 13% of the vote. In the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Hall was a supporter of Howard Dean's campaign. Hall was re-elected in 2006, placing fourth and receiving 13% of the vote; Hall narrowly defeated fellow incumbent Donald Ryder, a Republican, receiving just 25 more votes than him.In 2007, Hall announced her candidacy for chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Her main opponent was Raymond Buckley, the vice chair of the state party and an executive member of the Democratic National Committee. During the campaign, Buckley, who was considered to be the frontrunner, was falsely accused of possessing child pornography by former state representative Steve Vaillancourt, who had been a former friend of his. Buckley was exonerated following an official state investigation, and Vaillancourt later stated that he had exaggerated in the allegations. Later in the campaign, Joe Kelly Levasseur, the chairman of the Manchester Republican Party, posted an old home video of Buckley to YouTube, in which Buckley, who is openly gay, is seen \"cursing and unzipping his pants\", as well as highlighting Buckley's membership in a MySpace group called \"Gays in New Hampshire\". Despite this, Buckley maintained his support amongst statewide Democrats, with the exception of U.S. representative Paul Hodes, who withdrew his support for Buckley following the release of the video. Buckley ultimately defeated Hall, receiving 109 votes to Hall's 17. A third candidate, former state house Democratic Leader Jim Craig, withdrew following Buckley's exoneration, but remained on the ballot.\n\nProposed impeachment of George W. Bush\nIn 2008, Hall again gained national prominence for introducing a bill in the New Hampshire House of Representatives which would petition the United States Congress to introduce articles to impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for high crimes and misdemeanors relating to the Iraq War. The bill accused Bush and Cheney of electioneering, torture, unlawful surveillance, misleading Congress, and violating the United Nations Charter by engaging in an unlawful aggressive war, as well as other alleged crimes. The bill, New Hampshire House Resolution 24, cited section 603 of Jefferson's Manual, which states that \"an impeachment may be set in motion by the United States House of Representatives by charges transmitted from the legislature of a state\". In 1973, Hall had opposed a similar bill calling for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon.Hall campaigned for impeachment alongside U.S. representative Dennis Kucinich, whose campaign she supported in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Hall's bill was supported by Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, former US attorney general Ramsey Clark, and former director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Robert M. Bowman. However, the bill also had several outspoken opponents, such as Republican state representative David Hess, who stated he had \"never seen a document more vitriolic and more inflammatory\".In February 2008, the House State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee voted 10-5 to recommend that the House not vote for the bill. In April 2008, the state house voted 227-95 to table the resolution, effectively killing the legislation. Some Democrats who voted in favor of tabling the bill, such as state representatives Ray Gagnon and Susan Almy, both of whom said they supported the bill in principle, stated that the bill would take away time that could be spent fixing everyday issues. Bernie Benn, another Democratic state representative, stated that impeachment would be too divisive.\n\nIndependent candidacies\nLater in 2008, Hall ran for the 12th district of the New Hampshire Senate as an independent candidate, despite still being a registered Democrat. Hall placed a distant third with just 10% of the vote. Democrat Peggy Gilmour won with 47% of the vote, while Republican state representative Paul LaFlamme received 43%. In 2010, Hall officially switched her party registration to independent, stating that she \"wanted to make a statement [that] neither party was doing what they should be\". That year, Hall ran as an independent candidate for the New Hampshire House of Representatives in Hillsborough County's 5th district. However, Hall placed seventh out of eight candidates, receiving just 6% of the vote in the district she formerly represented. In 2012, Hall ran as an independent candidate for the state house in Hillsborough County's 12th district. She placed last out of five candidates, receiving 10% of the vote.\n\nDeath\nHall died on April 26, 2018, of congestive heart failure in Petersburgh, New York. At the time of her death, Hall had 5 children, 12 grandchildren, and 21 great-grandchildren.\n\nTenure\nDuring her tenure with both the Republican and Democratic parties, Hall frequently challenged her party's political establishment. While in the Republican Party, Hall was seen as a member of the party's liberal wing; she was an objector to the Vietnam War and opposed an attempt to outlaw abortion, with Hall stating, \"I don't think I should legislate my religious beliefs on someone else\". While a Democrat, Hall was seen as a firebrand emblematic of the party's grassroots base, challenging the Democratic establishment by opposing Buckley in 2007 and leading the attempt to impeach Bush. Hall was described as \"a giant among the moral compass-holders in the community\".While in the state house, Hall's primary issues were the government integrity and campaign finance reform. Hall was also an advocate for mental health issues. She served as the first president of Milford Regional Counseling Services in the 1970s, and later founded Harbor Homes, an organization that provides transitional housing for people with mental illness. In the 1960s, Hall was also the president of the Waban Association for Retarded Children.\n\nEconomy, regulation, and taxation\nIn 1989, Hall led opposition towards a bill which would introduce new regulations against gravel pit operators. However, the following week, in what was described as \"parliamentary shenanigans\", the bill was revived, amended, and passed in both chambers of the state legislature. Later in 1989, Hall sponsored a bottle bill which would have introduced a 5-cent deposit on bottles and cans in order finance recycling centers. The bill also called for bottles and cans to be recycled instead of reused. Hall sponsored a similar bill in 1979, which would have imposed a tax ranging from $25 to $9,000 a year on businesses in order to fund litter control and recycling.In 1990, New Hampshire's economy collapsed and the state fell heavily into debt. Hall opposed a bill which would order the state to repay all of its bills within 30 days, stating that it didn't solve the problem and \"would only make us think we're doing something\". Hall also opposed a budget which would marginally cut spending and levy small taxes, such as a 4-cent cigarette tax and a 5% phone tax, stating that \"cutting 10 percent and 20 percent isn't going to do. Nickel and dime taxes aren't going to do it either\". She was instead supportive of the legislature stepping back and allow the governor to \"reduce spending any way he could\". Hall had previously opposed the state budget in 1979 due to the inclusion of a 1-cent gas tax. In 2007, Hall supported legislation pushed by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative which would \"reduce carbon pollution from power plants, lower energy bills and strengthen our economy\".\n\nEducation\nThroughout her career, Hall supported the breaking up of cooperative school districts. Cooperative school districts, known as school administrative units (SAUs), were school districts consisting of multiple towns. Hall said that wealthier, smaller towns would be forced to disproportionately fund an SAU when grouped with poorer, larger towns. She also said the small towns were effectively trapped in the SAU as long as the larger towns were able to out-vote the smaller towns.In 1971, Hall sponsored legislation which would establish a volunteer corps to provide assistance and counseling to minors who violated the law. In 1973, she sponsored a bill which would create a scholarship program for college students from New Hampshire. After a first attempt failed in the House, the bill was amended to apply only to students attending in-state colleges. The program would provide matching funds for college students: the state would allocate 25 cents for every dollar given by a private scholarship. During her 2008 state senate campaign, Hall stated that she opposed funding education from property taxes, instead supporting a \"pay-as-you-go\" model.\n\nGovernment integrity and reform\nIn 1972, Hall supported an election reform bill which would restrict candidates from working in polling places in which their name was on the ballot. She was the only representative from a small town to support the bill. Introduced by state representative Chris Spirou, the bill had public support, but faced heavy opposition in the House after being \"verbally beaten into the ground by many state representatives from small towns who double as election officials in their home communities\". In her support for the bill, Hall said that it could allow for more people to become involved in the political process.\nWhile with Common Cause in 1977, Hall supported a state ethics commission to watch over the state legislature, stating that at the time New Hampshire was the only state that didn't have conflict-of-interest legislation. In 1979, Hall supported a rule change in the state house that would require all members of the House to list their sources of income. In the mid-2000s, Hall stated her concerned with the outsourcing of New Hampshire's vote counting systems to private companies, citing security and integrity concerns. In 2006, Hall proposed a bill which would make primary and general election days a state holiday. The same year, Hall supported a rules change in the state house which would end segregated party seating, which she said increased partisanship by keeping members of opposing parties separated from each other. During her independent candidacies, Hall also advocated for elections to be publicly funded in order to limit the effects of corporate influence on elections. Due to her work on campaign finance reform, Hall was frequently compared to Doris Haddock, who she was friends with, and with whom she collaborated on election reform issues with.\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nWilliam Worthington (actor)\nWilliam Worthington (April 8, 1872 in Troy, New York \u2013 April 9, 1941 in Beverly Hills, California) was an American silent film actor and director.\n\nCareer\nWorthington became interested in the performing arts when he began his career as an opera singer and stage actor. He entered films with a lead role in 1913, and one of his more notable films was Damon and Pythias in 1914. From 1917 to 1925, William concentrated on directing films and was the head of a film production firm called Multicolor, which was bought by Cinecolor in 1932. He was active in films up until his death in 1941.\n\nFilmography\nActor\nDirector\nSee also\nMulticolor\nPassage 3:\nWild Child (film)\nWild Child is a 2008 teen comedy film directed by Nick Moore and starring Emma Roberts, Natasha Richardson, Shirley Henderson, Alex Pettyfer and Aidan Quinn, with Georgia King, Kimberley Nixon, Juno Temple, Linzey Cocker and Sophie Wu. Roberts portrays Poppy Moore, a wealthy and spoiled American teenager who is sent to a boarding school in England by her widowed father, where she soon learns the true meaning of life and friendship. This was Richardson's final film role before her death the following year.\n\nPlot\nPoppy Moore, a wealthy but spoiled and rebellious teenager from Malibu, California, damages and discards the belongings of her widowed father's new girlfriend, Rosemary. She grabs a handful of Rosemary's clothes and jumps into the ocean just as her furious father, Gerry, arrives. Gerry announces he will be sending Poppy to Abbey Mount, a boarding school in England, in the hopes that attending the school will turn her life around. When Poppy arrives at Abbey Mount, she is warmly greeted by the headmistress Mrs. Kingsley, and later the head girl, Harriet Bentley, who is disgusted by her sense of entitlement. Poppy learns to her dismay that the bedrooms are communal and is introduced to Kate, Josie, Kiki and Jennifer, also known as \"Drippy\". She is initially hostile towards her new roommates upon meeting them, and her behaviour gets them into trouble when she insults the Matron, who confiscates their cellphones and gives them three weeks of detention.\nWhen Kate asks Poppy about her mother, she reveals that she died in a car crash when Poppy was eleven years old. Kate lets Poppy use her actual cellphone to message her friend from back home, Ruby, who is secretly cheating with Poppy's boyfriend, Roddy. The girls decide to help Poppy get expelled from Abbey Mount by carrying out several pranks, which gradually brings them closer together. When none of their plans work, they decide to have Poppy seduce Mrs. Kingsley's son, Freddie, who is forbidden from fraternizing with the female students. After the girls go shopping at a charity shop, they take Poppy to a hair salon for a makeover, where hairdresser Mr. Christopher removes her blonde hair dye and reveals her natural brunette hair. At the school dance, Freddie rejects Harriet in favour of dancing with Poppy, much to Harriet's dismay. Poppy trips on the dancefloor and Freddie takes her outside for fresh air, where he asks her out on a date. \nThe next day, Poppy discovers her newfound talent for lacrosse and becomes the team's new captain. After several weeks of practicing and improving their skills, the team advances to the finals for the first time since 1976. Finding themselves falling in love with one another, Poppy and Freddie go for a drive in the countryside, where Freddie takes Poppy out for lunch and they kiss. Poppy returns to school only to find her roommates reading an email allegedly written by her, suggesting she was pretending to be friends with them so she could get herself expelled and return to Malibu. Poppy claims she did not write the emails, but the girls refuse to listen and walk out on her. When Freddie receives a similar email, Poppy tries to explain herself, but he slams the door in her face. With no one else to turn to, Poppy sneaks into the kitchen and calls Ruby, who accidentally reveals her affair with Roddy and hangs up on her. \nFeeling even more alone, Poppy starts playing with her lighter and accidentally sets a curtain on fire. Hearing footsteps, she quickly puts out the fire and runs back to her bedroom, but a few minutes later, Drippy sees the curtains engulfed in flames and is locked inside the freezer. When Poppy is awoken by the sound of an explosion, she looks out the window and sees the fire growing and immediately wakes the school. When everyone realizes Drippy is missing, Poppy runs into the burning school to rescue her. After the fire is extinguished, Freddie finds her lighter and gives it back to her, refusing to hear any explanation. Realizing she no longer wants to leave, Poppy writes an apology letter to Freddie and later goes to Mrs. Kingsley's office to take the blame for the fire. Afterwards, she finds a portrait of her late mother in the 1976 Abbey Mount lacrosse team and begins to cry upon realizing her mother had attended the school. \nWhile Poppy waits for the Honour Court to decide whether or not she should be expelled, Freddie finds her crying and becomes convinced the fire was an accident, and forgives her. Meanwhile, Drippy reads aloud Poppy's diary, revealing how much Poppy likes her roommates, and Kiki discovers who actually wrote the emails. At the hearing, Poppy gives her testimony and Harriet is determined to prove her guilt, while Poppy's roommates arrive and begin whispering to the other girls. When they all stand up in support of Poppy, Harriet bursts into a tirade and mentions Poppy's lighter. The girls realize that no lighter was ever mentioned and Mrs. Kingsley questions how Harriet knew about the lighter. When Poppy deduces that Harriet was responsible, Harriet snaps at her and accidentally confesses to restarting the fire after Poppy had put it out. A furious Mrs. Kingsley demands to see Harriet in her office and Poppy is absolved. \nAt the lacrosse finals, Gerry arrives and is taken aback by Poppy's dramatic change in personality and how much she resembles her mother. Abbey Mount wins the lacrosse championship and Poppy, who admits that her father did the right thing by enrolling her at the school, reconciles with him. The next morning, Harriet is expelled and prepares to leave with her father, but not before Harriet's former friends toss her dead pheasants out the window and onto her. Several months later, Poppy and Freddie have resumed their relationship, and she invites her roommates to a pool party at her Malibu mansion. When Freddie notices Ruby trying to call Poppy, she ignores her, now well aware she is not a real friend, and the girls prepare to jump into the ocean.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe interiors of the boarding school were filmed at Cobham Hall in Kent. The facade of the school was filmed at Balls Park. They also filmed at 82 Main Street, 84 Main Street, 117 Main Street, and at the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum in Haworth, Keighley, Bradford. Filming also took place in Harrogate, and at Robin Hood's Bay in North Yorkshire.\n\nReception\nWild Child was released in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2008, taking fifth place at the box office with $2,196,366 from 359 cinemas with an average of $6,118.

Universal had planned a North American release in the summer of 2009, but canceled it and chose to release the film directly to DVD.\n\nCritical response\nWild Child has a 41% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"More mild than wild. This tween comedy mess falls flat on its face due to poor characters, poor direction and poor jokes\". The Sun Online gave the film 2/5 saying \"WILD? More like mild, unless you think short skirts and 'horse face' put-downs are outrageous.\" Urban Cinefile gave Wild Child a much more favourable review, stating \"The film has an energy and honesty about it: it's lively, funny and smart and the characters are appealing.\"\nRating the film 2 out of 5 stars, The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw deemed the film's story and characters \"amiable enough, but still a bit tame\" compared to films such as Clueless and Freaky Friday. Describing Wild Child as \"A tweenie comedy with an uplifting American-style sports movie awkwardly bolted on\", David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph considered the film to be \"a mess\" with predictable plot twists and inferior to the film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. In a mostly positive review for Variety, Leslie Felperin wrote that Dahl's script \"puts more emphasis on character development and plot mechanics than the recent, slapstick-laden, girls\u2019-school-set \"St. Trinian's,\" and still manages to have funnier one-liners\". Felperin also found that the film's \"third-act endorsement of female friendship turns out to be surprisingly affecting, despite obvious sentimentality.\" Meanwhile, Jack Wilson of The Age took a different view of the characters' development, finding that Dahl's screenplay \"dwells unpleasantly on cruelty and humiliation, and finally Poppy does little more than exchange one form of snobbery for another.\"\n\nDVD release\nWild Child was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2008. In Australia, it was released on 15 January 2009. In the United States, it was released directly to DVD on 17 November 2009.\n\nSoundtrack\nWild Child: The Movie Soundtrack Party Album is a soundtrack album by the film of the same name, released in the United Kingdom and Australia on 18 August 2008.

It is based on the 1920 Porter Emerson Browne play The Bad Man. Three other films, all titled The Bad Man, are also based on the same play: \n\nin 1923, directed by Edwin Carewe and starring Holbrook Blinn\nin 1930, directed by Clarence Badger and starring Walter Huston\nin 1941, starring Wallace Beery and Ronald Reagan and directed by Richard Thorpe.\n\nPlot\nOn a train bound for lawless northern China, businessman Gordon Creed (Ricardo Cortez) encounters acquaintance Myron Galt (Douglas Wood) and his attractive daughter Lola (Sheila Bromley). Galt is on his way to foreclose on a very promising oilfield built up by Jim Hallet (Gordon Oliver). Creed, on the other hand, wants to offer Hallet enough money to pay off his loan from Galt (for a tidy share of the oilfield).\nCreed is annoyed when his reserved compartment is appropriated by General Chow Fu-Shan (Vladimir Sokoloff). The general is on his way to deal with self-styled General Wu Yen Fang (Boris Karloff), a warlord who has taken control of a province. However, Chow Fu-Shan is assassinated on the train by one of Fang's men.\nAfter being questioned by military governor General Ma (Tetsu Komai), the three travel by horse to a remote town, where they find not only Hallet (Gordon Oliver), but Creed's estranged wife Jane (Beverly Roberts), who is working for missionary Dr. Abernathy (Gordon Hart). Then, Fang's subordinate, Captain Kung Nui (Chester Gan) and his men take over the town. When Kung Nui casts his eyes on Jane, Hallet impulsively punches him. Jane and Hallet have fallen in love, though she does not believe in divorce and has kept their relationship strictly platonic. Hallet is knocked out and imprisoned.\nWhen Fang arrives, he tries to persuade Jane to go with him, promising she would enjoy it (blithely explaining \"I am Fang\"). Hallet escapes with the help of an associate disguised as one of Fang's soldiers, and sends him to notify General Ma of Fang's whereabouts. Hallet then breaks in on Fang and Jane's private discussion. Fang remembers Hallet, who once hid a coolie and dug three bullets out of his shoulder; that was Fang before his meteoric rise. The warlord decides to help his benefactor. Fang robs Creed of $50,000, uses it to pay Galt what Hallet owes, then takes the money and offers it to Dr. Abernathy.\nCreed bribes Captain Kung Nui to rebel against Fang. Kung Nui wants to regain face by having Hallet executed. Fang pretends to give in, but just before a firing squad shoots the oilman, Fang has his right-hand man, Mr. Cheng (Richard Loo), kill Kung Nui. Afterward, Fang personally shoots Creed to fix Hallet's romantic problem, but only manages to wound him.\nGovernment troops arrive and force their way into the town. In the confusion, Jane, accompanied by Hallet, goes to attend to her husband's wound. Creed produces a gun and announces that Hallet is going to have a fatal accident, but is killed by Fang.\nWith the battle lost, Fang decides to surrender rather than risk the lives of his captives by fighting to the end. He is taken out and shot.\n\nCast\nBoris Karloff as General Wu Yen Fang\nBeverly Roberts as Mrs. Jane Creed\nRicardo Cortez as Gordon Creed\nGordon Oliver as Jim Hallet\nSheila Bromley as Lola Galt\nDouglas Wood as Myron Galt\nVladimir Sokoloff as General Chow Fu-Shan\nGordon Hart as Dr. Abernathy\nRichard Loo as Mr. Cheng\nChester Gan as Captain Kung Nui\nTetsu Komai as General Ma\n\nProduction\nThis was the second film John Farrow directed for Warner Bros.\nKarloff was to make Black Widow for Warner Bros.

However, when Ken arrives he finds out that his father and Warner have been killed. He does not reveal his identity to any of the townspeople, and Warner's daughter, Mary, suspects him of being one of the rustlers. As they verbally spar, Ken learns that Mary had known of a plan of Clem and her father to trap the rustlers. The only person she shared the information with was Rance Collins. He meets up with an old friend Ranger Simpson, known by the nickname of \"Repeater\", who he lets know what he is attempting to do.\nSuspecting that Rance must be involved, Ken learns who some of his associates are. He follows one back to the gang's hideout, and after overhearing of their plans to finish rustling Warner's cattle, steps into the room and asks for a job. Collins is skeptical, but then Repeater shows up and, as set up before by him and Ken, arrests Ken for Clem's murder. Collins suspicions of Ken are alleviated, and he and some of his men ride after the two. They help Ken escape, during which Ken makes it appear as if Repeater has been killed. However, once back at the hideout, suspicions once again begin to arise. Finally, one of the rustlers returns to the hideout and recognizes Ken from Warner's ranch earlier that day.

Hall served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives for a total of 28 years, serving non-consecutively from 1970 until 2008.\nHall grew up in New York City, where she attended Barnard College. In 1948, she and her husband moved to the town of Brookline, New Hampshire, where they started a textile manufacturing firm. Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, Hall began participating in local politics, serving on several boards and commissions in Brookline. Hall was elected to the Brookline school board in 1963, and in 1972, she was elected to the town board of selectmen.\nHall's career in statewide politics began in 1970 when she was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. In 1986, Hall switched her party affiliation to the Democratic Party, citing the Republican Party's shift towards conservatism during the Reagan Era. During her political career, Hall was described as a firebrand who frequently bucked her party. While a Republican, Hall was seen as a liberal member of that party, and was considered to be a political enemy by conservative leaders. In the Democratic Party, Hall was a member of the grassroots base, challenging the party's establishment in a 2007 campaign for chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\nIn the 2000s, Hall became nationally known for her activism. In 2004, she was arrested for disorderly conduct for her participation in a protest against President George W. Bush; she was later acquitted of the charge. In 2008, Hall introduced New Hampshire House Resolution 24, which would have petitioned the United States Congress to introduce articles to impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their actions leading to and during the Iraq War. While the bill ultimately failed, it generated a large amount of media coverage.\n\nPre-political life and career\nEarly life and education\nBeatrice Perin Barker was born on March 18, 1921, in Koblenz, Germany, where her father Joseph Warren Barker, a United States Army officer, served as the administrator of a military district following World War I. After leaving the military, Barker's father completed his education in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving an academic position at the institution. He later became the Dean of Engineering at Columbia University, and she primarily grew up in New York City. This led to Barker's entry into academia, as her father's position at Columbia University brought prominent scientists such as Enrico Fermi and Harold Urey to their home for dinner where Barker would serve as a hostess. In 1937, her mother Mary died when Barker was 16.Barker attended the Horace Mann School and later studied engineering at Barnard College. Barker would later do graduate work at the University of New Hampshire, Boston University, and the College of the Holy Cross.\n\nFamily and career\nAfter graduating from Barnard College in 1943, Barker worked as an engineer at Western Electric. During World War II, she helped manufacture vacuum tubes for radar equipment, and her father served as a special assistant to Frank Knox, the United States Secretary of the Navy.On May 27, 1944, she married Sidney Leavitt Hall, an engineer from Concord, New Hampshire, leaving her job at Western Electric to join her husband in Ohio, where he was undergoing training with the United States Air Force in order to fight in World War II. However, the war ended before he was sent overseas, and in 1948, the couple moved to Brookline, New Hampshire, a town of 800 people in Hillsborough County. Hall's grandmother, Florence Hobart Perin, was a resident of Brookline, and Hall had frequently visited and spent several summers in the town during her youth. Sidney Hall initially worked at Textron, and in 1951, the couple started a textile manufacturing firm called Hall Manufacturing Company, which was informally known as Hall Tote Bags. The company produced stitching for dry-cleaners, as well as steam air covers for dry-cleaning machines. Later, the company became locally famous for the tote bags they produced, as well as other stitched products. Hall and her husband were members of the local Church of Christ, and she was credited with uniting the Brookline Methodist and Congregationalist churches into one single church.In 1957, Hall received a fellowship from the National Science Foundation. Hall served as the assistant manager for Hall Manufacturing Co. until 1962, whereupon she became a science and mathematics teacher in Groton, Massachusetts. Hall transferred to Fairgrounds Junior High School in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1964, and taught mathematics there until 1972. In 1968, Hall was awarded a grant by the Research Corporation for Science Advancement in order to start an experimental \"Mathematics Learning Laboratory\" at her school. She had also been invited to academic conferences, such as the Advanced Modern Math Institute, which was sponsored by Science Research Associates.Sidney Hall died in 1987 at the age of 66. Hall and her husband had 4 sons and 1 daughter. One of their sons, Sidney Hall Jr., is a locally-known author.  Following her husband's death, Hall solely ran Hall Manufacturing Co., and the company was featured in a White House symposium on small businesses in 1994. Hall Manufacturing Co. closed in 2001.\n\nEarly political career\nLocal politics\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Hall became very active in local politics, serving on numerous boards and committees in Brookline, including the board of assessors and the town finance committee. In 1961, Hall was defeated in an election for Brookline library trustee. In 1963, Hall was elected unopposed to the Brookline school board. She was re-elected in 1966, defeating future state representative Eben Bartlett and another candidate. In 1969, Hall was re-elected for her third and final term on the school board. She served as the chairman of the school board from 1964 until 1968 and again in 1971. She served a total of 9 years on the school board.In 1967, Hall ran for the Brookline board of selectmen; however, she was defeated by Walter W. Frost, receiving 138 votes to Frost's 152. In 1972, Hall served as the chairman of the Brookline Republican Town Committee. Later that year, Hall again ran for the Brookline board of selectmen to succeed the retiring Grover C. Farwell, defeating two candidates to win a three-year term as selectman. Following her election to the board of selectmen, Hall did not seek another term for the school board and resigned as a teacher. In 1974, Hall served as the chairman of the board of selectmen.\n\nEarly 1970s\nIn 1970, Hall ran for the New Hampshire House of Representatives in Hillsborough County's 13th district as a member of the Republican Party. Hall had decided to run for state office because she \"realized she was not accomplishing what she wanted to\" in local office. She was recruited to run by Governor Walter R. Peterson Jr. Hall and fellow Republican Daniel Brocklebank were elected with 43% and 41% of the vote, respectively. In 1972, Hall ran for re-election in Hillsborough County's 12th district, and was elected unopposed alongside fellow Republican Jack Boyd. During the 1970s, Hall held multiple positions in the local Republican Party, serving as a member of the Republican state committee the Hillsborough County Republican Party Executive Committee.\n\n1974 state senate campaign\nIn 1974, Hall ran for the 12th district of the New Hampshire Senate, running to replace retiring Republican incumbent Frederick A. Porter. In the Republican primary, Hall faced fellow state representative D. Alan Rock, as well as Milford town selectman Frederic Fletcher, a former state senator and former member of the Executive Council. During the primary, Hall campaigned via bicycle, cycling a total of 1,000 miles through the 26 towns in the district. Hall won the primary election, narrowly defeating Rock. Despite Hall placing second in her hometown of Brookline and only winning two towns, Amherst and Hollis, both towns gave her large margins. Additionally, she placed second in nearly every other town in the district, offsetting the large margin by which Rock won in Nashua. Official sources conflict on the final vote tally: the New Hampshire General Court officially reported that Hall received 1,544 votes, Rock received 1,485 votes, and Fletcher received 1,198 votes, giving Hall a winning margin of just 59 votes. However, a recount found that the margin was actually 114 votes in favor of Hall, with the town of Amherst alone overcounting 50 ballots in favor of Rock; however, the results of the recount are not officially recorded. Hall's campaign expenditure for the primary was $1,470.While there was no official Democratic Party candidate running in the heavily Republican district, both Hall and Rock also contested the Democratic primary as write-in candidates. Rock won the Democratic write-in nomination, with official sources again conflicting on the tally: the New Hampshire General Court reported that Rock received 72 votes to Hall's 71, a margin of just one vote, while a recount reportedly increased Rock's margin to 3 votes.During the general election campaign, Rock was heavily supported by William Loeb III, the publisher of the Manchester Union Leader, an influential conservative newspaper. Rock frequently used the newspaper's front page to promote his campaign. While Hall was endorsed by the Nashua Telegraph, her campaign did not have the media capabilities that Rock's did, and Rock ultimately won the general election, defeating Hall by a margin of 53% to 47%. Judd Gregg, then the chairman of the Nashua Republican Party, alleged that the party's campaign literature had been tampered with; specifically, Gregg alleged that an individual had switched out Hall's campaign literature from several envelopes and replaced it with Rock's campaign literature before they were sent out to voters in Nashua. However, Hall stated that she did not believe the incident had influenced the end result of the election. Hall was succeeded in the state house by Republican Dorothy Foss Colson.\n\nLate 1970s and early 1980s\nIn 1975, Hall became the chairman of the New Hampshire branch of Common Cause, a lobbying group that opposes corruption and promotes campaign finance reform. In this role, Hall advocated for good government. In the 1976 presidential election, Hall criticized Republican candidate Ronald Reagan and independent candidate Eugene McCarthy for being the only two major candidates who had not agreed to the campaign standards proposed by Common Cause. She later criticized all the presidential candidates for not discussing the costs of the programs they propose. Hall left the position in September 1977.In 1978, Hall was elected back to the New Hampshire House of Representatives for Hillsborough County's 12th district. Hall and fellow Republican Eliot B. Ware won with 36% and 31% of the vote. Hall and Ware were re-elected unopposed in 1980.In November 1980, Rock, who had still serving as the state senator for the 12th district, died of cancer just three days after winning re-election. Hall was one of four candidates vying for the Republican nomination for the February 1981 special election; instead of being elected in a primary election, the party nominee was instead to be selected by delegates of the Hillsborough County Republican Party. Hall's campaign for the nomination was heavily opposed by Robert B. Monier, the influential Republican president of the New Hampshire Senate, who viewed Hall as a political opponent. Monier instead supported John Stabile, a Nashua businessman and the New Hampshire campaign chair for John Connally's 1980 presidential campaign. The other Republican candidates were state representatives Joanne Head, Philip Labombarde, and Emma Wheeler. Despite an initial convention ending in deadlock, with 9 delegates voting for Hall and the other 9 for Stabile, the party reconvened and ultimately selected Stabile to be the Republican nominee. Stabile would go on to defeat Democratic state representative Selma Pastor and independent candidate Mark Knox, a Nashua alderman, in the special election.In 1982, Hall ran for the 11th district of the New Hampshire Senate to replace retiring Republican incumbent Arthur Mann. Hall placed third in the Republican primary, losing to fellow state representative Jean T. White; Hall received 29% of the vote, while White received 40%. The second-place candidate, state representative Richard Amidon, received 31% of the vote. However, Hall won the Democratic nomination as a write-in candidate, receiving 199 votes compared to White's 81 and Amidon's 55. Hall was defeated by White in the general election, receiving 4,668 votes to White's 6,632.\n\nParty switch and later political career\nLate 1980s and 1990s\nIn 1986, Hall switched to the Democratic Party, citing the Republican Party's shift towards conservatism. That year, Hall ran as a Democrat for the state house in Hillsborough County's 16th district. Hall defeated incumbent Republican state representative Barbara Fried, who had been facing charges of embezzlement after it was revealed she used her position as Greenville town clerk to embezzle $10,000 in fees. Hall received 642 votes, while Fried received 555. Hall was narrowly re-elected in 1988, defeating Republican candidate Shirley A. Morley by just 54 votes out of 2,274 cast. Hall was re-elected in 1990, defeating former Republican state representative Webster E. Bridges, 56% to 44%.In 1992, Hall ran for re-election in Hillsborough County's 20th district. Hall and Republican Thomas I. Arnold were elected, receiving 1,488 votes and 1,384 votes, respectively. Hall and Arnold had previously served together on the Brookline school board in the 1960s, where Arnold was the school board's moderator. The two were re-elected unopposed in 1994. In 1996, they were again re-elected, with Hall receiving 46% of the vote and Arnold receiving 36%. In 1996, Hall served as the chairman of the Hillsborough County Democratic Party. In 1998, Hall and Arnold were again re-elected. Arnold received 1,063 votes, while Hall received 1,001.Hall was an early supporter of Bill Clinton in the 1992 United States presidential election, and was a delegate for Clinton at the 1996 Democratic Party convention. Hall also praised Richard Lugar during the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries, supporting his tax policy and stating that he seemed honest.\n\n2000s\nIn 2000, Hall and Arnold were re-elected unopposed. In 2002, Hall ran for re-election in Hillsborough County's 46th district. However, Hall was defeated in the general election, placing fifth with 12% of the vote.In 2004, Hall was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct at a protest against President George W. Bush in Nashua. Hall, who was 83 at the time, was sitting in a chair outside the designated area for protestors, and was close to the presidential motorcade route. Hall was also holding a sign that said, \"Bush is bad for America\". After Hall refused to move, three police officers picked Hall up, \"chair, cane, and all\", carrying her away and arresting her. A photographer captured the arrest, and the incident became national news. Hall was acquitted in September 2004 after Nashua District Court judge Clifford Kinghorn ruled that the evidence provided did not fit the charge of disorderly conduct; Kinghorn stated that \"the police had no authority under state law to make Hall move because she wasn't getting in their way\". Hall also explained that she had originally written the law that was being applied to her case.Later in 2004, Hall ran again for the state house for Hillsborough County's 5th district. Hall won, placing fourth with 13% of the vote. In the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Hall was a supporter of Howard Dean's campaign. Hall was re-elected in 2006, placing fourth and receiving 13% of the vote; Hall narrowly defeated fellow incumbent Donald Ryder, a Republican, receiving just 25 more votes than him.In 2007, Hall announced her candidacy for chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Her main opponent was Raymond Buckley, the vice chair of the state party and an executive member of the Democratic National Committee. During the campaign, Buckley, who was considered to be the frontrunner, was falsely accused of possessing child pornography by former state representative Steve Vaillancourt, who had been a former friend of his. Buckley was exonerated following an official state investigation, and Vaillancourt later stated that he had exaggerated in the allegations. Later in the campaign, Joe Kelly Levasseur, the chairman of the Manchester Republican Party, posted an old home video of Buckley to YouTube, in which Buckley, who is openly gay, is seen \"cursing and unzipping his pants\", as well as highlighting Buckley's membership in a MySpace group called \"Gays in New Hampshire\". Despite this, Buckley maintained his support amongst statewide Democrats, with the exception of U.S. representative Paul Hodes, who withdrew his support for Buckley following the release of the video. Buckley ultimately defeated Hall, receiving 109 votes to Hall's 17. A third candidate, former state house Democratic Leader Jim Craig, withdrew following Buckley's exoneration, but remained on the ballot.\n\nProposed impeachment of George W. Bush\nIn 2008, Hall again gained national prominence for introducing a bill in the New Hampshire House of Representatives which would petition the United States Congress to introduce articles to impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for high crimes and misdemeanors relating to the Iraq War. The bill accused Bush and Cheney of electioneering, torture, unlawful surveillance, misleading Congress, and violating the United Nations Charter by engaging in an unlawful aggressive war, as well as other alleged crimes. The bill, New Hampshire House Resolution 24, cited section 603 of Jefferson's Manual, which states that \"an impeachment may be set in motion by the United States House of Representatives by charges transmitted from the legislature of a state\". In 1973, Hall had opposed a similar bill calling for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon.Hall campaigned for impeachment alongside U.S. representative Dennis Kucinich, whose campaign she supported in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Hall's bill was supported by Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, former US attorney general Ramsey Clark, and former director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Robert M. Bowman. However, the bill also had several outspoken opponents, such as Republican state representative David Hess, who stated he had \"never seen a document more vitriolic and more inflammatory\".In February 2008, the House State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee voted 10-5 to recommend that the House not vote for the bill. In April 2008, the state house voted 227-95 to table the resolution, effectively killing the legislation. Some Democrats who voted in favor of tabling the bill, such as state representatives Ray Gagnon and Susan Almy, both of whom said they supported the bill in principle, stated that the bill would take away time that could be spent fixing everyday issues. Bernie Benn, another Democratic state representative, stated that impeachment would be too divisive.\n\nIndependent candidacies\nLater in 2008, Hall ran for the 12th district of the New Hampshire Senate as an independent candidate, despite still being a registered Democrat. Hall placed a distant third with just 10% of the vote. Democrat Peggy Gilmour won with 47% of the vote, while Republican state representative Paul LaFlamme received 43%. In 2010, Hall officially switched her party registration to independent, stating that she \"wanted to make a statement [that] neither party was doing what they should be\". That year, Hall ran as an independent candidate for the New Hampshire House of Representatives in Hillsborough County's 5th district. However, Hall placed seventh out of eight candidates, receiving just 6% of the vote in the district she formerly represented. In 2012, Hall ran as an independent candidate for the state house in Hillsborough County's 12th district. She placed last out of five candidates, receiving 10% of the vote.\n\nDeath\nHall died on April 26, 2018, of congestive heart failure in Petersburgh, New York. At the time of her death, Hall had 5 children, 12 grandchildren, and 21 great-grandchildren.\n\nTenure\nDuring her tenure with both the Republican and Democratic parties, Hall frequently challenged her party's political establishment. While in the Republican Party, Hall was seen as a member of the party's liberal wing; she was an objector to the Vietnam War and opposed an attempt to outlaw abortion, with Hall stating, \"I don't think I should legislate my religious beliefs on someone else\". While a Democrat, Hall was seen as a firebrand emblematic of the party's grassroots base, challenging the Democratic establishment by opposing Buckley in 2007 and leading the attempt to impeach Bush. Hall was described as \"a giant among the moral compass-holders in the community\".While in the state house, Hall's primary issues were the government integrity and campaign finance reform. Hall was also an advocate for mental health issues. She served as the first president of Milford Regional Counseling Services in the 1970s, and later founded Harbor Homes, an organization that provides transitional housing for people with mental illness. In the 1960s, Hall was also the president of the Waban Association for Retarded Children.\n\nEconomy, regulation, and taxation\nIn 1989, Hall led opposition towards a bill which would introduce new regulations against gravel pit operators. However, the following week, in what was described as \"parliamentary shenanigans\", the bill was revived, amended, and passed in both chambers of the state legislature. Later in 1989, Hall sponsored a bottle bill which would have introduced a 5-cent deposit on bottles and cans in order finance recycling centers. The bill also called for bottles and cans to be recycled instead of reused. Hall sponsored a similar bill in 1979, which would have imposed a tax ranging from $25 to $9,000 a year on businesses in order to fund litter control and recycling.In 1990, New Hampshire's economy collapsed and the state fell heavily into debt. Hall opposed a bill which would order the state to repay all of its bills within 30 days, stating that it didn't solve the problem and \"would only make us think we're doing something\". Hall also opposed a budget which would marginally cut spending and levy small taxes, such as a 4-cent cigarette tax and a 5% phone tax, stating that \"cutting 10 percent and 20 percent isn't going to do. Nickel and dime taxes aren't going to do it either\". She was instead supportive of the legislature stepping back and allow the governor to \"reduce spending any way he could\". Hall had previously opposed the state budget in 1979 due to the inclusion of a 1-cent gas tax. In 2007, Hall supported legislation pushed by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative which would \"reduce carbon pollution from power plants, lower energy bills and strengthen our economy\".\n\nEducation\nThroughout her career, Hall supported the breaking up of cooperative school districts. Cooperative school districts, known as school administrative units (SAUs), were school districts consisting of multiple towns. Hall said that wealthier, smaller towns would be forced to disproportionately fund an SAU when grouped with poorer, larger towns. She also said the small towns were effectively trapped in the SAU as long as the larger towns were able to out-vote the smaller towns.In 1971, Hall sponsored legislation which would establish a volunteer corps to provide assistance and counseling to minors who violated the law. In 1973, she sponsored a bill which would create a scholarship program for college students from New Hampshire. After a first attempt failed in the House, the bill was amended to apply only to students attending in-state colleges. The program would provide matching funds for college students: the state would allocate 25 cents for every dollar given by a private scholarship. During her 2008 state senate campaign, Hall stated that she opposed funding education from property taxes, instead supporting a \"pay-as-you-go\" model.\n\nGovernment integrity and reform\nIn 1972, Hall supported an election reform bill which would restrict candidates from working in polling places in which their name was on the ballot. She was the only representative from a small town to support the bill. Introduced by state representative Chris Spirou, the bill had public support, but faced heavy opposition in the House after being \"verbally beaten into the ground by many state representatives from small towns who double as election officials in their home communities\". In her support for the bill, Hall said that it could allow for more people to become involved in the political process.\nWhile with Common Cause in 1977, Hall supported a state ethics commission to watch over the state legislature, stating that at the time New Hampshire was the only state that didn't have conflict-of-interest legislation. In 1979, Hall supported a rule change in the state house that would require all members of the House to list their sources of income. In the mid-2000s, Hall stated her concerned with the outsourcing of New Hampshire's vote counting systems to private companies, citing security and integrity concerns. In 2006, Hall proposed a bill which would make primary and general election days a state holiday. The same year, Hall supported a rules change in the state house which would end segregated party seating, which she said increased partisanship by keeping members of opposing parties separated from each other. During her independent candidacies, Hall also advocated for elections to be publicly funded in order to limit the effects of corporate influence on elections. Due to her work on campaign finance reform, Hall was frequently compared to Doris Haddock, who she was friends with, and with whom she collaborated on election reform issues with.\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nWilliam Worthington (actor)\nWilliam Worthington (April 8, 1872 in Troy, New York \u2013 April 9, 1941 in Beverly Hills, California) was an American silent film actor and director.\n\nCareer\nWorthington became interested in the performing arts when he began his career as an opera singer and stage actor. He entered films with a lead role in 1913, and one of his more notable films was Damon and Pythias in 1914. From 1917 to 1925, William concentrated on directing films and was the head of a film production firm called Multicolor, which was bought by Cinecolor in 1932. He was active in films up until his death in 1941.\n\nFilmography\nActor\nDirector\nSee also\nMulticolor\nPassage 3:\nWild Child (film)\nWild Child is a 2008 teen comedy film directed by Nick Moore and starring Emma Roberts, Natasha Richardson, Shirley Henderson, Alex Pettyfer and Aidan Quinn, with Georgia King, Kimberley Nixon, Juno Temple, Linzey Cocker and Sophie Wu. Roberts portrays Poppy Moore, a wealthy and spoiled American teenager who is sent to a boarding school in England by her widowed father, where she soon learns the true meaning of life and friendship. This was Richardson's final film role before her death the following year.\n\nPlot\nPoppy Moore, a wealthy but spoiled and rebellious teenager from Malibu, California, damages and discards the belongings of her widowed father's new girlfriend, Rosemary. She grabs a handful of Rosemary's clothes and jumps into the ocean just as her furious father, Gerry, arrives. Gerry announces he will be sending Poppy to Abbey Mount, a boarding school in England, in the hopes that attending the school will turn her life around. When Poppy arrives at Abbey Mount, she is warmly greeted by the headmistress Mrs. Kingsley, and later the head girl, Harriet Bentley, who is disgusted by her sense of entitlement. Poppy learns to her dismay that the bedrooms are communal and is introduced to Kate, Josie, Kiki and Jennifer, also known as \"Drippy\". She is initially hostile towards her new roommates upon meeting them, and her behaviour gets them into trouble when she insults the Matron, who confiscates their cellphones and gives them three weeks of detention.\nWhen Kate asks Poppy about her mother, she reveals that she died in a car crash when Poppy was eleven years old. Kate lets Poppy use her actual cellphone to message her friend from back home, Ruby, who is secretly cheating with Poppy's boyfriend, Roddy. The girls decide to help Poppy get expelled from Abbey Mount by carrying out several pranks, which gradually brings them closer together. When none of their plans work, they decide to have Poppy seduce Mrs. Kingsley's son, Freddie, who is forbidden from fraternizing with the female students. After the girls go shopping at a charity shop, they take Poppy to a hair salon for a makeover, where hairdresser Mr. Christopher removes her blonde hair dye and reveals her natural brunette hair. At the school dance, Freddie rejects Harriet in favour of dancing with Poppy, much to Harriet's dismay. Poppy trips on the dancefloor and Freddie takes her outside for fresh air, where he asks her out on a date. \nThe next day, Poppy discovers her newfound talent for lacrosse and becomes the team's new captain. After several weeks of practicing and improving their skills, the team advances to the finals for the first time since 1976. Finding themselves falling in love with one another, Poppy and Freddie go for a drive in the countryside, where Freddie takes Poppy out for lunch and they kiss. Poppy returns to school only to find her roommates reading an email allegedly written by her, suggesting she was pretending to be friends with them so she could get herself expelled and return to Malibu. Poppy claims she did not write the emails, but the girls refuse to listen and walk out on her. When Freddie receives a similar email, Poppy tries to explain herself, but he slams the door in her face. With no one else to turn to, Poppy sneaks into the kitchen and calls Ruby, who accidentally reveals her affair with Roddy and hangs up on her. \nFeeling even more alone, Poppy starts playing with her lighter and accidentally sets a curtain on fire. Hearing footsteps, she quickly puts out the fire and runs back to her bedroom, but a few minutes later, Drippy sees the curtains engulfed in flames and is locked inside the freezer. When Poppy is awoken by the sound of an explosion, she looks out the window and sees the fire growing and immediately wakes the school. When everyone realizes Drippy is missing, Poppy runs into the burning school to rescue her. After the fire is extinguished, Freddie finds her lighter and gives it back to her, refusing to hear any explanation. Realizing she no longer wants to leave, Poppy writes an apology letter to Freddie and later goes to Mrs. Kingsley's office to take the blame for the fire. Afterwards, she finds a portrait of her late mother in the 1976 Abbey Mount lacrosse team and begins to cry upon realizing her mother had attended the school. \nWhile Poppy waits for the Honour Court to decide whether or not she should be expelled, Freddie finds her crying and becomes convinced the fire was an accident, and forgives her. Meanwhile, Drippy reads aloud Poppy's diary, revealing how much Poppy likes her roommates, and Kiki discovers who actually wrote the emails. At the hearing, Poppy gives her testimony and Harriet is determined to prove her guilt, while Poppy's roommates arrive and begin whispering to the other girls. When they all stand up in support of Poppy, Harriet bursts into a tirade and mentions Poppy's lighter. The girls realize that no lighter was ever mentioned and Mrs. Kingsley questions how Harriet knew about the lighter. When Poppy deduces that Harriet was responsible, Harriet snaps at her and accidentally confesses to restarting the fire after Poppy had put it out. A furious Mrs. Kingsley demands to see Harriet in her office and Poppy is absolved. \nAt the lacrosse finals, Gerry arrives and is taken aback by Poppy's dramatic change in personality and how much she resembles her mother. Abbey Mount wins the lacrosse championship and Poppy, who admits that her father did the right thing by enrolling her at the school, reconciles with him. The next morning, Harriet is expelled and prepares to leave with her father, but not before Harriet's former friends toss her dead pheasants out the window and onto her. Several months later, Poppy and Freddie have resumed their relationship, and she invites her roommates to a pool party at her Malibu mansion. When Freddie notices Ruby trying to call Poppy, she ignores her, now well aware she is not a real friend, and the girls prepare to jump into the ocean.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe interiors of the boarding school were filmed at Cobham Hall in Kent.

Universal had planned a North American release in the summer of 2009, but canceled it and chose to release the film directly to DVD.\n\nCritical response\nWild Child has a 41% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"More mild than wild. This tween comedy mess falls flat on its face due to poor characters, poor direction and poor jokes\". The Sun Online gave the film 2/5 saying \"WILD? More like mild, unless you think short skirts and 'horse face' put-downs are outrageous.\" Urban Cinefile gave Wild Child a much more favourable review, stating \"The film has an energy and honesty about it: it's lively, funny and smart and the characters are appealing.\"\nRating the film 2 out of 5 stars, The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw deemed the film's story and characters \"amiable enough, but still a bit tame\" compared to films such as Clueless and Freaky Friday. Describing Wild Child as \"A tweenie comedy with an uplifting American-style sports movie awkwardly bolted on\", David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph considered the film to be \"a mess\" with predictable plot twists and inferior to the film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. In a mostly positive review for Variety, Leslie Felperin wrote that Dahl's script \"puts more emphasis on character development and plot mechanics than the recent, slapstick-laden, girls\u2019-school-set \"St. Trinian's,\" and still manages to have funnier one-liners\". Felperin also found that the film's \"third-act endorsement of female friendship turns out to be surprisingly affecting, despite obvious sentimentality.\" Meanwhile, Jack Wilson of The Age took a different view of the characters' development, finding that Dahl's screenplay \"dwells unpleasantly on cruelty and humiliation, and finally Poppy does little more than exchange one form of snobbery for another.\"\n\nDVD release\nWild Child was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2008. In Australia, it was released on 15 January 2009. In the United States, it was released directly to DVD on 17 November 2009.\n\nSoundtrack\nWild Child: The Movie Soundtrack Party Album is a soundtrack album by the film of the same name, released in the United Kingdom and Australia on 18 August 2008.

Three other films, all titled The Bad Man, are also based on the same play: \n\nin 1923, directed by Edwin Carewe and starring Holbrook Blinn\nin 1930, directed by Clarence Badger and starring Walter Huston\nin 1941, starring Wallace Beery and Ronald Reagan and directed by Richard Thorpe.\n\nPlot\nOn a train bound for lawless northern China, businessman Gordon Creed (Ricardo Cortez) encounters acquaintance Myron Galt (Douglas Wood) and his attractive daughter Lola (Sheila Bromley). Galt is on his way to foreclose on a very promising oilfield built up by Jim Hallet (Gordon Oliver). Creed, on the other hand, wants to offer Hallet enough money to pay off his loan from Galt (for a tidy share of the oilfield).\nCreed is annoyed when his reserved compartment is appropriated by General Chow Fu-Shan (Vladimir Sokoloff). The general is on his way to deal with self-styled General Wu Yen Fang (Boris Karloff), a warlord who has taken control of a province. However, Chow Fu-Shan is assassinated on the train by one of Fang's men.\nAfter being questioned by military governor General Ma (Tetsu Komai), the three travel by horse to a remote town, where they find not only Hallet (Gordon Oliver), but Creed's estranged wife Jane (Beverly Roberts), who is working for missionary Dr. Abernathy (Gordon Hart). Then, Fang's subordinate, Captain Kung Nui (Chester Gan) and his men take over the town. When Kung Nui casts his eyes on Jane, Hallet impulsively punches him. Jane and Hallet have fallen in love, though she does not believe in divorce and has kept their relationship strictly platonic. Hallet is knocked out and imprisoned.\nWhen Fang arrives, he tries to persuade Jane to go with him, promising she would enjoy it (blithely explaining \"I am Fang\"). Hallet escapes with the help of an associate disguised as one of Fang's soldiers, and sends him to notify General Ma of Fang's whereabouts. Hallet then breaks in on Fang and Jane's private discussion. Fang remembers Hallet, who once hid a coolie and dug three bullets out of his shoulder; that was Fang before his meteoric rise. The warlord decides to help his benefactor. Fang robs Creed of $50,000, uses it to pay Galt what Hallet owes, then takes the money and offers it to Dr. Abernathy.\nCreed bribes Captain Kung Nui to rebel against Fang. Kung Nui wants to regain face by having Hallet executed. Fang pretends to give in, but just before a firing squad shoots the oilman, Fang has his right-hand man, Mr. Cheng (Richard Loo), kill Kung Nui. Afterward, Fang personally shoots Creed to fix Hallet's romantic problem, but only manages to wound him.\nGovernment troops arrive and force their way into the town. In the confusion, Jane, accompanied by Hallet, goes to attend to her husband's wound. Creed produces a gun and announces that Hallet is going to have a fatal accident, but is killed by Fang.\nWith the battle lost, Fang decides to surrender rather than risk the lives of his captives by fighting to the end. He is taken out and shot.\n\nCast\nBoris Karloff as General Wu Yen Fang\nBeverly Roberts as Mrs. Jane Creed\nRicardo Cortez as Gordon Creed\nGordon Oliver as Jim Hallet\nSheila Bromley as Lola Galt\nDouglas Wood as Myron Galt\nVladimir Sokoloff as General Chow Fu-Shan\nGordon Hart as Dr. Abernathy\nRichard Loo as Mr. Cheng\nChester Gan as Captain Kung Nui\nTetsu Komai as General Ma\n\nProduction\nThis was the second film John Farrow directed for Warner Bros.\nKarloff was to make Black Widow for Warner Bros.

Karloff's makeup required three hours of work per day; this was less time than was required for his non-human roles.\n\nReception\nThe New York Times wrote Karloff \"admirably acquits himself as a comedian\" in the film which nonetheless had \"atmospheric validity\" due to \"numerous Chinese extras and an imaginative treatment of sets.\"\n\nSee also\nBoris Karloff filmography\nPassage 7:\nJohn Chaffey\nJohn Chaffey is an English osteopathic doctor and former child film actor.\n\nFilm career\nChaffey was featured in many television adverts as a child.

However, when Ken arrives he finds out that his father and Warner have been killed. He does not reveal his identity to any of the townspeople, and Warner's daughter, Mary, suspects him of being one of the rustlers. As they verbally spar, Ken learns that Mary had known of a plan of Clem and her father to trap the rustlers. The only person she shared the information with was Rance Collins. He meets up with an old friend Ranger Simpson, known by the nickname of \"Repeater\", who he lets know what he is attempting to do.\nSuspecting that Rance must be involved, Ken learns who some of his associates are. He follows one back to the gang's hideout, and after overhearing of their plans to finish rustling Warner's cattle, steps into the room and asks for a job. Collins is skeptical, but then Repeater shows up and, as set up before by him and Ken, arrests Ken for Clem's murder. Collins suspicions of Ken are alleviated, and he and some of his men ride after the two. They help Ken escape, during which Ken makes it appear as if Repeater has been killed. However, once back at the hideout, suspicions once again begin to arise. Finally, one of the rustlers returns to the hideout and recognizes Ken from Warner's ranch earlier that day.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nHenry, Lord Paulet\nLord Henry Paulet (1602\u20131672) was an English courtier who sat briefly in the House of Commons in the 2nd Parliament of Charles I, from February to June 1626. \nPaulet was a son of William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester. On 6 March 1618, he was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was created Knight of the Bath at the Coronation of Charles I and was of Amport, Hampshire. In 1626, he was elected as one of the two members of parliament for Andover.Paulet married Lucy Philpot, a daughter of Sir George Philpot. Their son Francis was the grandfather of the twelfth Marquess of Winchester.\nPassage 2:\nLewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly\nLewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly (c. 1626\u20131653) was a Scottish nobleman.\nHe was the third son of George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly.\n\nBiography\nBorn when his father was commander of the Garde \u00c9cossaise, he was named after Louis XIII of France, and brought up until the age of ten by his grandfather, George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly. From an early age, he showed himself to be a reckless romantic \u2013 while still a child, he stole some jewels and attempted to take ship to Holland, presumably to join the army. When he was thirteen, the First Bishops' War broke out, and the young nobleman sneaked out of Gordon Castle (one account says he climbed over the wall) and hurried to the Highlands, where he raised a brigade of clansmen from his father's estates to fight the Covenanters. His first experience of war was at Megray Hill, where his Highlanders scattered in the face of enemy cannon fire.\nFollowing the peace, Lord Lewis travelled to France, where he enlisted as an ordinary pikeman in an infantry regiment, in order to learn his soldiering from the ground up. After three years, he traveled to England, working his way north by serving on both sides in the English Civil War, first in the royalist army and then in the Scottish Covenanter forces of his uncle, the Earl of Argyll, the same army he had fought against in 1639.\nEventually returning home, the sixteen-year-old nobleman seduced and married the fianc\u00e9e of his absent elder brother, Viscount Aboyne. He served on both sides in the Scottish Civil War, playing an important role in his father's occupation of Aberdeen in 1646, where he engaged an enemy cavalry commander in single combat and then storming the town. Going into exile after the defeat of the royalists, he traveled again to France; in rapid succession, he succeeded his brother and father as Earl of Enzie and Marquess of Gordon, and by 1651, he was allowed to return to Scotland, even though he refused to conform to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland (he was probably a Roman Catholic).\nIn 1645 Lord Lewis attacked Brodie Castle in Moray and setting it afire destroyed important archives and documents detailing the origins of the illustrious Clan Brodie. This despicable act secured Clan Brodie's place among the great mysteries of Scotland.\nHe died aged 26 or 27, leaving a young widow (whom he had apparently converted to Catholicism), three daughters, and a four-year-old son who would eventually become the 1st Duke of Gordon. Miles Gourdon, a cavalry commander in the French army known as the chevalier or count of \"Crolis\", was perhaps an illegitimate son, as he is said to have been a brother of the duke.His reputation among historians has varied; he is the clearest hero in the Civil War narrative of his kinsman Patrick Gordon of Ruthven, while John Buchan regarded him as wild and headstrong to the point of insanity.\nPassage 3:\nChristopher Lambert (MP)\nChristopher Lambert, of Winchester, Hampshire, was an English politician.\nHe was the second son of William Lambert of Winchester and a servant of Sir William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester.\nLambert was a Member of Parliament for Bridport in 1593.\nPassage 4:\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester  (c.\u20091532 \u2013 24 November 1598) was an English nobleman, the son of John Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester and his first wife, Elizabeth Willoughby.

During October 1586, he was one of the judges at the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, later acting as Lord High Steward at her funeral on 1 August 1587.\nHe is known as the author of The Lord Marquess Idleness, a remarkable and most ingenious acrostic of six Latin verses. It was published in 1586 and 1587.\n\nMarriage and issue\nBetween 20 June 1544 and 10 February 1547/1548 he married Anne or Agnes Howard, daughter of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham and his first wife, Katherine Broughton and had issue:\nWilliam Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester, died 4 February 1629, married Lucy Cecil, daughter of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter\nAnne Paulet, born 1552, married Sir Thomas Denys (modern spelling: Dennis), of Holcombe Burnell, Devon; grandparents of the prodigy Denys Rolle\nKatherine Paulet, married Sir Giles Wroughton\nElizabeth Paulet, married Sir Edward HobyThe marriage was not a happy one, and the couple were only reconciled, on one occasion, by Elizabeth I's intervention.Paulet also had children with his recognised mistress Jane Lambert, who later married the much younger Sir Gerrard Fleetwood:\nSir William Paulet, died 1628, lawyer, London, later of Edington, Wiltshire.

On 24 November 1598, he succeeded his father as 4th Marquess of Winchester. Paulet experienced great financial difficulties arising from his magnificent style of living and his lavish entertainment of Elizabeth I at Basing House.\n\nMarriage and issue\nOn 28 February 1587 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, he married Lady Lucy Cecil, daughter of Sir Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter and his first wife, Dorothy Neville.

Among his siblings was Maj Lord Alexander Kennedy, Lord John Kennedy, Lady Julia Alice Kennedy, Lady Evelyn Anne Kennedy, and Lady Constance Eleanor Kennedy.His father was the eldest son of Archibald Kennedy, Earl of Cassilis, himself the oldest son of Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa.  His mother was the second daughter of Sir Richard Jephson, 1st Baronet and the former Charlotte Rochfort Smith.\n\nCareer\nAs a young man, he served as an officer in the Coldstream Guards. In 1885, he founded the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, which was based in Troon and Ayr, Ayrshire.\n\nPeerage\nUpon the death of his father on 20 March 1870, he succeeded to the titles of 14th Earl of Cassilis, 16th Lord Kennedy, 3rd Marquess of Ailsa and 3rd Baron Ailsa. Along with the title came 76,000 acres in Ayrshire. He held the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Ayrshire between 1919 and 1937.\n\nPersonal life\nLord Ailsa was twice married. His first marriage took place on 7 March 1871 to Hon. Evelyn Stuart, daughter of Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre and Lady Evelyn Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (herself a daughter of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland). Together, they were the parents of five children:\nArchibald Kennedy, 4th Marquess of Ailsa (1872\u20131943), who married Frances Stewart, daughter of Sir Mark MacTaggart-Stewart, 1st Baronet.\nCharles Kennedy, 5th Marquess of Ailsa (1875\u20131956), who married Constance Clarke, widow of Sir John Baird.\nLady Evelyn Kennedy (1876\u20131886), who died young.\nLady Aline Kennedy (1877\u20131957), who married John Edward Browne, 5th Baron Kilmaine (1878\u20131946) in 1901.\nAngus Kennedy, 6th Marquess of Ailsa (1882\u20131957), who married Gertrude Millicent Cooper.He married secondly on 3 November 1891 to Isabella MacMaster, the only daughter of Hugh MacMaster, a market gardener of Kausani, India.

He had his own shipyard at Culzean Castle, where he built the 5-ton Cocker.\nPassage 7:\nRichard Paulet, 17th Marquess of Winchester\nRichard Charles Paulet, 17th Marquess of Winchester (born on 8 July 1905; died 5 March 1968) was the son of Charles Standish Paulet and Lillian Jane Charlotte Fosbery. He was the great-grandson of Lord Charles Paulet, a younger son of the 13th Marquess. He inherited the title from Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester, in 1962. He died unmarried, and the title was passed to his cousin Nigel Paulet, 18th Marquess of Winchester.\nPassage 8:\nWilliam Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester\nWilliam Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester  (c. 1483/1485 \u2013 10 March 1572), styled Lord St John between 1539 and 1550 and Earl of Wiltshire between 1550 and 1551, was an English Lord High Treasurer, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and statesman.\n\nFamily origins and early career in Hampshire\nPaulet was the eldest son of Sir John Paulet (1460 \u2013 5 January 1525) of Basing Castle in the parish of Old Basing, near Basingstoke in Hampshire, and of Nunney Castle in Somerset (inherited from the Delamere family in 1415), a cadet branch of Paulet of Hinton St George in Somerset. His mother Alice Paulet was his father's second cousin-once-removed the daughter of Sir William Paulet by his wife Elizabeth Denebaud. William had six siblings, including Sir George Paulet of Crondall Manor in Hampshire and Eleanor Paulet (born 1479), wife of William Giffard of Itchell Manor at Ewshot, also in Hampshire.\nThe family originated at the manor of Paulet (now Pawlett), near Bridgwater in Somerset. The senior branch of the Paulet/Powlet/Poulett family was seated at Hinton St George in Somerset, and had lived in that county since the early thirteenth century; the first Member of Parliament from that line represented Devon in 1385.There is some disagreement over his date of birth, with different authorities quoting 1483 or 1485. A claim that he was ninety-seven at his death would place his birth in 1474 or 1475. There is also uncertainty about where he was born, but it may have been at Fisherton Delamere in Wiltshire, one of his father's manors.His father, who had held a command against the Cornish rebels in 1497, was the head of the branch seated at Paulet and Road, close to Bridgwater, being the son of John Paulet and Elizabeth Roos. William's great-grandfather John Paulet acquired the Hampshire estates by his marriage with Constance Poynings, granddaughter and coheiress of Thomas Poynings, 5th Baron St John of Basing; his barony became abeyant upon his death in 1428/1429.\nWilliam Paulet was High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1512, 1519, 1523, and again in 1527. Knighted before the end of 1525, he was appointed Master of the King's Wards in November 1526 and appeared in the Privy Council in the same year.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married Elizabeth (d. 25 December 1558), daughter of Sir William Capel, Lord Mayor of London in 1503, and by her had four sons and four daughters:\nJohn Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester\nThomas\nChidiock Paulet (also spelled Chidiok, Chediok, Chidieok, or Chidiock), governor of Southampton under Mary and Elizabeth\nGiles\nAlice, married Richard Stawell, of Cotherston, Somerset\nMargaret, married Sir William Berkeley\nMargery, married Sir Richard Waller, of Oldstoke, Hampshire\nEleanor (died 26 September 1558), married Sir Richard Pecksall (died 1571) of Beaurepaire, Hampshire, hereditary Master of the Buckhounds.\n\nCareer as a national statesman\nDuring his long career Paulet held numerous offices, which included:\nHigh Sheriff of Hampshire 1511\u201312, 1518\u201319 and 1522\u201323\nJoint Master of the King's Wards 1526\u201334 and sole Master of the King's Wards 1534\u201340\nMember of Parliament for Hampshire 1529\u201336\nComptroller of the Household 1532\u201337\nKeeper of Pamber Forest 1535/6\nTreasurer of the Household 1537\u201338/9\nMaster of the King's Woods 1541\nMaster of the Court of Wards 1540\u201342\nMaster of the Court of Wards and Liveries 1542\u201354\nPrivy Counsellor 1542\nLord Chamberlain of the Household 1543\u201345\nLord Steward of the Household 1545-1549/50\nChief Justice in Eyre, South of Trent 1545\u201349/50\nLord President of the Council 1546\u201349\nJoint Governor of King Edward VI\nLord Keeper of the Great Seal 1547\nKeeper and Captain of St Andrew's Castle, Hamble 1547\u201371/2\nKeeper of Alice Holt and Woolmer Forests 1548\u201371/2\nLord High Treasurer 1549/50\u201371/2\nLord High Steward for the trial of the Duke of Somerset 1551\nLord Lieutenant of Hampshire 1552, 1553 and 1559\nLieutenant of the forces in London 1558\nSpeaker of the House of Lords 1558 and 1566\nLord Lieutenant of Hampshire and Middlesex 1569\nJoint Lord Lieutenant of London 1569Paulet's political career began in 1529, when he was elected knight of the shire for Hampshire. In 1532, he accompanied King Henry VIII to Calais, France, and the following spring, he accompanied the Duke of Norfolk to join King Francis I of France in a proposed audience with the Pope, to discuss Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. In 1536, he was granted the keepership of Pamber Forest, and on 9 March 1539 was created Baron St John. He became steward of the bishopric of Winchester, and became a close associate of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and a friend of Thomas Cromwell. He was also Comptroller of the Royal Household, and held many other high positions.\nIn 1535 and 1536, he served as one of the judges for the trials of John Fisher, Sir Thomas More, and the alleged accomplices of Anne Boleyn; in 1535, he became Lord Chamberlain. He partially led the royal forces against the Pilgrimage of Grace, a rebellion that broke out in the autumn of 1536, and in 1538, he became Treasurer of the Household. In 1540, he became the master of Henry's Court of Wards and Liveries, a Knight of the Garter in 1543, and Governor of Portsmouth and Lord Steward of the Household in 1545. In 1546, he became Lord President of the Council, and in 1547, he was an executor of the will of King Henry VIII.He continued his political manoeuvres in 1549 by supporting the Earl of Warwick against the Duke of Somerset\u2014in reward, on 19 January 1550 he was given the Earldom of Wiltshire and Somerset's position of Lord Treasurer. In the following month Warwick took over the post of Lord President of the Council. When Warwick was created Duke of Northumberland on 11 October 1551, Paulet received the Marquessate of Winchester. Six weeks later, he served as Lord High Steward in the Duke of Somerset's trial.\nIt was said that Northumberland and Winchester \"ruled the court\" of the minor King Edward VI. Mary I affirmed him in all of his positions. After her death, he remained Lord Treasurer and retained many of his other positions, and even at an advanced age (in 1559, he was over seventy years old), he showed no signs of declining\u2014he was Speaker of the House of Lords in 1559 and 1566. He remained in good standing with the English monarchs\u2014Queen Elizabeth once joked, \"for, by my troth, if my lord treasurer were but a young man, I could find it in my heart to have him for a husband before any man in England.\" Late in life, he opposed any military support of Continental Protestantism, as he feared it would cause a breach with strongly Catholic Spain.\nPaulet enjoyed a remarkably long career during the Reformation. Starting out as a Catholic, he was quickly persuaded to see things Henry's way once the breach with Rome had been decided on. He was rewarded with former Church properties following the dissolution of the monasteries. Under Edward VI he became an evangelical Protestant and persecuted Roman Catholics and Henrician Conservatives alike. On the accession of the Catholic Mary he announced his reconversion and commenced persecuting his former Protestant co-religionists, even denouncing Bishop Bonner for \"laxity in prosecuting the heretics.\" His wife also found favour with Mary. On Tuesday 21 August 1554, when Mary went into Westminster Abbey her train was carried by Elizabeth, Marchioness of Winchester and Anne of Cleves.On Elizabeth's succession, he once again shifted his sails and became an advocate of middle-road Anglicanism. All in all, he professed five changes in religious course. Once, when asked how he managed to survive so many storms, not only unhurt, but rising all the while, Paulet answered: \"By being a willow, not an oak\".\n\nDeath\nPaulet was still in office when he died on 10 March 1572, a very old man, at Basing House, which he held to rebuild and fortify. His tomb is on the south side of the chancel of Basing church.\nPassage 9:\nJohn Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester\nJohn Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester (c. 1598 \u2013 5 March 1675), styled Lord John Paulet until 1621 and Lord St John from 1621 to 1628, was the third but eldest surviving son of William Paulet and his successor as 5th Marquess of Winchester.\n\nLife\nHe kept terms at Exeter College, Oxford, but as a Roman Catholic could not matriculate. He sat for St Ives from 1620 to 1622. Staying away to recover his family fortune for most of the 1630s, he returned and presented himself to the court and the king in 1639. The fifth Marquess and the Queen became firm friends thereafter, and therefore his chief seat, Basing House, was the great resort of Queen Henrietta Maria's friends in southwest England.On the outbreak of the English Civil War, he fortified and garrisoned Basing House and held it for Charles I during 1643 and 1644. The siege of Basing House, notwithstanding an attempt of his youngest brother, Lord Edward Paulet, to deliver it up to the enemy, lasted from August 1643 to 16 October 1645, when, during the general decline of the Royal cause, it was taken by storm, after a determined defence, by Oliver Cromwell. The brutality with which the house was sacked was most unusual, as atrocities against civilians during the Civil War were rare and generally discouraged by both sides: the explanation may be the presence of a number of Catholic priests among the defenders. Paulet was subsequently renowned as a great loyalist.The Marquess was made prisoner with such of his garrison as survived the fight; ten pieces of ordnance and much ammunition were also taken by the victors, as Oliver Cromwell himself, who directed the assault, wrote to the Speaker.He was committed to the Tower of London on a charge of high treason in 1645, where he remained a long time; an order was made for allowing him 5l. a week out of his property on 15 Jan 1646. Lady Winchester, who had escaped from Basing two days before its fall, was sent to join her husband in the Tower on 31 Jan, and a weekly sum of 10l., afterwards increased to 15l., was ordered to be paid her for the support of herself and her children, with the stipulation that the latter were to be educated as Protestants. An ordinance for the sale of Winchester's land was passed on 30 Oct, and by the act of 16 July 1651, a portion was sold by the trustees for the sale of forfeited estates. On 7 September 1647 Winchester was allowed to drink the waters at Epsom, and stayed there by permission of parliament for nearly six months. The House of Lords on 30 June 1648 urged the commons to release him on bail in consideration of his bad health. In the propositions sent to the king at the Isle of Wight on 13 October, it was expressly stipulated that Winchester's name be excepted from pardon. Ultimately the commons resolved on 14 March 1649 not to proceed against him for high treason, but they ordered him to be detained in prison and excepted from any composition for his estate. In January 1656 he was a prisoner in execution in the upper bench for debts amounting to 2,000l., and he petitioned Cromwell for relief. The sale of his lands was discontinued by order of parliament on 15 March 1660, and after the Restoration Winchester received them back. It was proposed on 3 August 1660 to recompense him for his losses to the amount of 19,000l. and damages, subsequently reduced to 10,000l., and this was agreed to on 2 July 1661. In the event he was allowed to go unrecompensed at the Restoration of the Monarchy, but regained his lands.\n\nMarriages and issue\nHe married as his first wife:\nJane Savage, daughter of Thomas Savage, 1st Viscount Savage of Rocksavage, on 18 December 1622, and by her had a son:Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton, born c. 1630\nJane died in childbirth in 1631, prompting an epitaph by John MiltonHe married as his second wife:\n\nHonora de Burgh, born c. 1605, daughter of Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde and Frances Walsingham, in around 1645 and by her, had a daughter:Anne, died c. September 1694, married John Belasyse, 1st Baron BelasyseHe married as his third wife:\n\nIsabel Howard, daughter of William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford and Mary Stafford, sister of the 5th Baron Stafford, in 1669.\n\nDeath\nHe retired to Englefield House in Berkshire, which was a wedding gift from his second marriage to Lady Honora de Burgh in the early 1630s. He died on 5 March 1674 and was buried at Englefield, Berkshire. Paulet was succeeded, by his eldest son, Charles Paulet, as 6th Marquess of Winchester, later created 1st Duke of Bolton. Charles converted to the Church of England, a great blow to the Roman Catholic community of Hampshire, who had for many years looked to the Paulet family to shield them from the worst rigours of the Penal Laws.\n\nFootnotes\nAttribution This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: \"The Genealogy of the Existing British Peerage\" by Edmund Lodge (1859)\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1895). \"Paulet, John\" .

He was the eldest son of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester and Elizabeth Capel.\n\nCareer\nJohn Paulet was knighted by Henry VIII at Boulogne on 30 September 1544. After the death of Edward VI he was (with his father) one of the signatories to the settlement of the Crown on Lady Jane Grey of 16 June 1553, although he later changed his allegiance to Queen Mary.

On 6 March 1618, he was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was created Knight of the Bath at the Coronation of Charles I and was of Amport, Hampshire. In 1626, he was elected as one of the two members of parliament for Andover.Paulet married Lucy Philpot, a daughter of Sir George Philpot. Their son Francis was the grandfather of the twelfth Marquess of Winchester.\nPassage 2:\nLewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly\nLewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly (c. 1626\u20131653) was a Scottish nobleman.\nHe was the third son of George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly.\n\nBiography\nBorn when his father was commander of the Garde \u00c9cossaise, he was named after Louis XIII of France, and brought up until the age of ten by his grandfather, George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly. From an early age, he showed himself to be a reckless romantic \u2013 while still a child, he stole some jewels and attempted to take ship to Holland, presumably to join the army. When he was thirteen, the First Bishops' War broke out, and the young nobleman sneaked out of Gordon Castle (one account says he climbed over the wall) and hurried to the Highlands, where he raised a brigade of clansmen from his father's estates to fight the Covenanters. His first experience of war was at Megray Hill, where his Highlanders scattered in the face of enemy cannon fire.\nFollowing the peace, Lord Lewis travelled to France, where he enlisted as an ordinary pikeman in an infantry regiment, in order to learn his soldiering from the ground up. After three years, he traveled to England, working his way north by serving on both sides in the English Civil War, first in the royalist army and then in the Scottish Covenanter forces of his uncle, the Earl of Argyll, the same army he had fought against in 1639.\nEventually returning home, the sixteen-year-old nobleman seduced and married the fianc\u00e9e of his absent elder brother, Viscount Aboyne. He served on both sides in the Scottish Civil War, playing an important role in his father's occupation of Aberdeen in 1646, where he engaged an enemy cavalry commander in single combat and then storming the town. Going into exile after the defeat of the royalists, he traveled again to France; in rapid succession, he succeeded his brother and father as Earl of Enzie and Marquess of Gordon, and by 1651, he was allowed to return to Scotland, even though he refused to conform to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland (he was probably a Roman Catholic).\nIn 1645 Lord Lewis attacked Brodie Castle in Moray and setting it afire destroyed important archives and documents detailing the origins of the illustrious Clan Brodie. This despicable act secured Clan Brodie's place among the great mysteries of Scotland.\nHe died aged 26 or 27, leaving a young widow (whom he had apparently converted to Catholicism), three daughters, and a four-year-old son who would eventually become the 1st Duke of Gordon. Miles Gourdon, a cavalry commander in the French army known as the chevalier or count of \"Crolis\", was perhaps an illegitimate son, as he is said to have been a brother of the duke.His reputation among historians has varied; he is the clearest hero in the Civil War narrative of his kinsman Patrick Gordon of Ruthven, while John Buchan regarded him as wild and headstrong to the point of insanity.\nPassage 3:\nChristopher Lambert (MP)\nChristopher Lambert, of Winchester, Hampshire, was an English politician.\nHe was the second son of William Lambert of Winchester and a servant of Sir William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester.\nLambert was a Member of Parliament for Bridport in 1593.\nPassage 4:\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester  (c.\u20091532 \u2013 24 November 1598) was an English nobleman, the son of John Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester and his first wife, Elizabeth Willoughby.

Among his siblings was Maj Lord Alexander Kennedy, Lord John Kennedy, Lady Julia Alice Kennedy, Lady Evelyn Anne Kennedy, and Lady Constance Eleanor Kennedy.His father was the eldest son of Archibald Kennedy, Earl of Cassilis, himself the oldest son of Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa.  His mother was the second daughter of Sir Richard Jephson, 1st Baronet and the former Charlotte Rochfort Smith.\n\nCareer\nAs a young man, he served as an officer in the Coldstream Guards. In 1885, he founded the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, which was based in Troon and Ayr, Ayrshire.\n\nPeerage\nUpon the death of his father on 20 March 1870, he succeeded to the titles of 14th Earl of Cassilis, 16th Lord Kennedy, 3rd Marquess of Ailsa and 3rd Baron Ailsa. Along with the title came 76,000 acres in Ayrshire. He held the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Ayrshire between 1919 and 1937.\n\nPersonal life\nLord Ailsa was twice married. His first marriage took place on 7 March 1871 to Hon. Evelyn Stuart, daughter of Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre and Lady Evelyn Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (herself a daughter of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland).

He had his own shipyard at Culzean Castle, where he built the 5-ton Cocker.\nPassage 7:\nRichard Paulet, 17th Marquess of Winchester\nRichard Charles Paulet, 17th Marquess of Winchester (born on 8 July 1905; died 5 March 1968) was the son of Charles Standish Paulet and Lillian Jane Charlotte Fosbery. He was the great-grandson of Lord Charles Paulet, a younger son of the 13th Marquess. He inherited the title from Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester, in 1962. He died unmarried, and the title was passed to his cousin Nigel Paulet, 18th Marquess of Winchester.\nPassage 8:\nWilliam Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester\nWilliam Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester  (c. 1483/1485 \u2013 10 March 1572), styled Lord St John between 1539 and 1550 and Earl of Wiltshire between 1550 and 1551, was an English Lord High Treasurer, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and statesman.\n\nFamily origins and early career in Hampshire\nPaulet was the eldest son of Sir John Paulet (1460 \u2013 5 January 1525) of Basing Castle in the parish of Old Basing, near Basingstoke in Hampshire, and of Nunney Castle in Somerset (inherited from the Delamere family in 1415), a cadet branch of Paulet of Hinton St George in Somerset. His mother Alice Paulet was his father's second cousin-once-removed the daughter of Sir William Paulet by his wife Elizabeth Denebaud. William had six siblings, including Sir George Paulet of Crondall Manor in Hampshire and Eleanor Paulet (born 1479), wife of William Giffard of Itchell Manor at Ewshot, also in Hampshire.\nThe family originated at the manor of Paulet (now Pawlett), near Bridgwater in Somerset. The senior branch of the Paulet/Powlet/Poulett family was seated at Hinton St George in Somerset, and had lived in that county since the early thirteenth century; the first Member of Parliament from that line represented Devon in 1385.There is some disagreement over his date of birth, with different authorities quoting 1483 or 1485. A claim that he was ninety-seven at his death would place his birth in 1474 or 1475. There is also uncertainty about where he was born, but it may have been at Fisherton Delamere in Wiltshire, one of his father's manors.His father, who had held a command against the Cornish rebels in 1497, was the head of the branch seated at Paulet and Road, close to Bridgwater, being the son of John Paulet and Elizabeth Roos. William's great-grandfather John Paulet acquired the Hampshire estates by his marriage with Constance Poynings, granddaughter and coheiress of Thomas Poynings, 5th Baron St John of Basing; his barony became abeyant upon his death in 1428/1429.\nWilliam Paulet was High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1512, 1519, 1523, and again in 1527. Knighted before the end of 1525, he was appointed Master of the King's Wards in November 1526 and appeared in the Privy Council in the same year.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married Elizabeth (d. 25 December 1558), daughter of Sir William Capel, Lord Mayor of London in 1503, and by her had four sons and four daughters:\nJohn Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester\nThomas\nChidiock Paulet (also spelled Chidiok, Chediok, Chidieok, or Chidiock), governor of Southampton under Mary and Elizabeth\nGiles\nAlice, married Richard Stawell, of Cotherston, Somerset\nMargaret, married Sir William Berkeley\nMargery, married Sir Richard Waller, of Oldstoke, Hampshire\nEleanor (died 26 September 1558), married Sir Richard Pecksall (died 1571) of Beaurepaire, Hampshire, hereditary Master of the Buckhounds.\n\nCareer as a national statesman\nDuring his long career Paulet held numerous offices, which included:\nHigh Sheriff of Hampshire 1511\u201312, 1518\u201319 and 1522\u201323\nJoint Master of the King's Wards 1526\u201334 and sole Master of the King's Wards 1534\u201340\nMember of Parliament for Hampshire 1529\u201336\nComptroller of the Household 1532\u201337\nKeeper of Pamber Forest 1535/6\nTreasurer of the Household 1537\u201338/9\nMaster of the King's Woods 1541\nMaster of the Court of Wards 1540\u201342\nMaster of the Court of Wards and Liveries 1542\u201354\nPrivy Counsellor 1542\nLord Chamberlain of the Household 1543\u201345\nLord Steward of the Household 1545-1549/50\nChief Justice in Eyre, South of Trent 1545\u201349/50\nLord President of the Council 1546\u201349\nJoint Governor of King Edward VI\nLord Keeper of the Great Seal 1547\nKeeper and Captain of St Andrew's Castle, Hamble 1547\u201371/2\nKeeper of Alice Holt and Woolmer Forests 1548\u201371/2\nLord High Treasurer 1549/50\u201371/2\nLord High Steward for the trial of the Duke of Somerset 1551\nLord Lieutenant of Hampshire 1552, 1553 and 1559\nLieutenant of the forces in London 1558\nSpeaker of the House of Lords 1558 and 1566\nLord Lieutenant of Hampshire and Middlesex 1569\nJoint Lord Lieutenant of London 1569Paulet's political career began in 1529, when he was elected knight of the shire for Hampshire. In 1532, he accompanied King Henry VIII to Calais, France, and the following spring, he accompanied the Duke of Norfolk to join King Francis I of France in a proposed audience with the Pope, to discuss Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. In 1536, he was granted the keepership of Pamber Forest, and on 9 March 1539 was created Baron St John. He became steward of the bishopric of Winchester, and became a close associate of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and a friend of Thomas Cromwell. He was also Comptroller of the Royal Household, and held many other high positions.\nIn 1535 and 1536, he served as one of the judges for the trials of John Fisher, Sir Thomas More, and the alleged accomplices of Anne Boleyn; in 1535, he became Lord Chamberlain. He partially led the royal forces against the Pilgrimage of Grace, a rebellion that broke out in the autumn of 1536, and in 1538, he became Treasurer of the Household. In 1540, he became the master of Henry's Court of Wards and Liveries, a Knight of the Garter in 1543, and Governor of Portsmouth and Lord Steward of the Household in 1545. In 1546, he became Lord President of the Council, and in 1547, he was an executor of the will of King Henry VIII.He continued his political manoeuvres in 1549 by supporting the Earl of Warwick against the Duke of Somerset\u2014in reward, on 19 January 1550 he was given the Earldom of Wiltshire and Somerset's position of Lord Treasurer. In the following month Warwick took over the post of Lord President of the Council. When Warwick was created Duke of Northumberland on 11 October 1551, Paulet received the Marquessate of Winchester. Six weeks later, he served as Lord High Steward in the Duke of Somerset's trial.\nIt was said that Northumberland and Winchester \"ruled the court\" of the minor King Edward VI. Mary I affirmed him in all of his positions. After her death, he remained Lord Treasurer and retained many of his other positions, and even at an advanced age (in 1559, he was over seventy years old), he showed no signs of declining\u2014he was Speaker of the House of Lords in 1559 and 1566. He remained in good standing with the English monarchs\u2014Queen Elizabeth once joked, \"for, by my troth, if my lord treasurer were but a young man, I could find it in my heart to have him for a husband before any man in England.\" Late in life, he opposed any military support of Continental Protestantism, as he feared it would cause a breach with strongly Catholic Spain.\nPaulet enjoyed a remarkably long career during the Reformation. Starting out as a Catholic, he was quickly persuaded to see things Henry's way once the breach with Rome had been decided on. He was rewarded with former Church properties following the dissolution of the monasteries. Under Edward VI he became an evangelical Protestant and persecuted Roman Catholics and Henrician Conservatives alike. On the accession of the Catholic Mary he announced his reconversion and commenced persecuting his former Protestant co-religionists, even denouncing Bishop Bonner for \"laxity in prosecuting the heretics.\" His wife also found favour with Mary. On Tuesday 21 August 1554, when Mary went into Westminster Abbey her train was carried by Elizabeth, Marchioness of Winchester and Anne of Cleves.On Elizabeth's succession, he once again shifted his sails and became an advocate of middle-road Anglicanism. All in all, he professed five changes in religious course. Once, when asked how he managed to survive so many storms, not only unhurt, but rising all the while, Paulet answered: \"By being a willow, not an oak\".\n\nDeath\nPaulet was still in office when he died on 10 March 1572, a very old man, at Basing House, which he held to rebuild and fortify. His tomb is on the south side of the chancel of Basing church.\nPassage 9:\nJohn Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester\nJohn Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester (c. 1598 \u2013 5 March 1675), styled Lord John Paulet until 1621 and Lord St John from 1621 to 1628, was the third but eldest surviving son of William Paulet and his successor as 5th Marquess of Winchester.\n\nLife\nHe kept terms at Exeter College, Oxford, but as a Roman Catholic could not matriculate. He sat for St Ives from 1620 to 1622. Staying away to recover his family fortune for most of the 1630s, he returned and presented himself to the court and the king in 1639. The fifth Marquess and the Queen became firm friends thereafter, and therefore his chief seat, Basing House, was the great resort of Queen Henrietta Maria's friends in southwest England.On the outbreak of the English Civil War, he fortified and garrisoned Basing House and held it for Charles I during 1643 and 1644. The siege of Basing House, notwithstanding an attempt of his youngest brother, Lord Edward Paulet, to deliver it up to the enemy, lasted from August 1643 to 16 October 1645, when, during the general decline of the Royal cause, it was taken by storm, after a determined defence, by Oliver Cromwell. The brutality with which the house was sacked was most unusual, as atrocities against civilians during the Civil War were rare and generally discouraged by both sides: the explanation may be the presence of a number of Catholic priests among the defenders. Paulet was subsequently renowned as a great loyalist.The Marquess was made prisoner with such of his garrison as survived the fight; ten pieces of ordnance and much ammunition were also taken by the victors, as Oliver Cromwell himself, who directed the assault, wrote to the Speaker.He was committed to the Tower of London on a charge of high treason in 1645, where he remained a long time; an order was made for allowing him 5l. a week out of his property on 15 Jan 1646. Lady Winchester, who had escaped from Basing two days before its fall, was sent to join her husband in the Tower on 31 Jan, and a weekly sum of 10l., afterwards increased to 15l., was ordered to be paid her for the support of herself and her children, with the stipulation that the latter were to be educated as Protestants. An ordinance for the sale of Winchester's land was passed on 30 Oct, and by the act of 16 July 1651, a portion was sold by the trustees for the sale of forfeited estates. On 7 September 1647 Winchester was allowed to drink the waters at Epsom, and stayed there by permission of parliament for nearly six months. The House of Lords on 30 June 1648 urged the commons to release him on bail in consideration of his bad health. In the propositions sent to the king at the Isle of Wight on 13 October, it was expressly stipulated that Winchester's name be excepted from pardon. Ultimately the commons resolved on 14 March 1649 not to proceed against him for high treason, but they ordered him to be detained in prison and excepted from any composition for his estate. In January 1656 he was a prisoner in execution in the upper bench for debts amounting to 2,000l., and he petitioned Cromwell for relief. The sale of his lands was discontinued by order of parliament on 15 March 1660, and after the Restoration Winchester received them back. It was proposed on 3 August 1660 to recompense him for his losses to the amount of 19,000l. and damages, subsequently reduced to 10,000l., and this was agreed to on 2 July 1661. In the event he was allowed to go unrecompensed at the Restoration of the Monarchy, but regained his lands.\n\nMarriages and issue\nHe married as his first wife:\nJane Savage, daughter of Thomas Savage, 1st Viscount Savage of Rocksavage, on 18 December 1622, and by her had a son:Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton, born c. 1630\nJane died in childbirth in 1631, prompting an epitaph by John MiltonHe married as his second wife:\n\nHonora de Burgh, born c. 1605, daughter of Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde and Frances Walsingham, in around 1645 and by her, had a daughter:Anne, died c. September 1694, married John Belasyse, 1st Baron BelasyseHe married as his third wife:\n\nIsabel Howard, daughter of William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford and Mary Stafford, sister of the 5th Baron Stafford, in 1669.\n\nDeath\nHe retired to Englefield House in Berkshire, which was a wedding gift from his second marriage to Lady Honora de Burgh in the early 1630s. He died on 5 March 1674 and was buried at Englefield, Berkshire. Paulet was succeeded, by his eldest son, Charles Paulet, as 6th Marquess of Winchester, later created 1st Duke of Bolton. Charles converted to the Church of England, a great blow to the Roman Catholic community of Hampshire, who had for many years looked to the Paulet family to shield them from the worst rigours of the Penal Laws.\n\nFootnotes\nAttribution This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: \"The Genealogy of the Existing British Peerage\" by Edmund Lodge (1859)\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1895). \"Paulet, John\" .

He proposed a motion on 25 January 1709 for an address to the Queen that she should consider remarrying. He also supported the naturalization of the Palatines. He was appointed to a committee to draft a bill to limit the time allowed for public mourning, since this  was felt to be having an  adverse effect on Canterbury's silk trade.

He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").:\u200a85\u201386\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the H\u0101shim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.:\u200a61\u200a\n'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib and \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

One day Muhammad's mother, Amina, wanted to go to Yathrib, where her husband, Abdullah, died. So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died six years after her husband's death. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad. But when Muhammad was eight years old, the very old Abd al-Muttalib became very sick and died at age 81-82 in 578-579 CE.\nShaybah ibn H\u0101shim's grave can be found in the Jannat al-Mu'all\u0101 cemetery in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nFamily tree of Shaiba ibn Hashim\nSahaba\nPassage 10:\nKevin Watson\nKevin Edward Watson (born 3 January 1974) is a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. After his retirement from playing, he turned non-league coach.\n\nPlaying career\nWatson started his career as a trainee with his local side Tottenham Hotspur. Watson scored his only Spurs goal on his debut in a League Cup tie against Brentford. As a youngster his first-team opportunities were limited and he went out on loan to several sides to build his experience, namely Brentford, Bristol City and Barnet.\nIn 1996, he was signed by Swindon Town manager Steve McMahon. Newly promoted to second tier of the English Football League \u2013 Watson helped them avoid relegation.\nWatson moved on to Rotherham United in July 1999, astute Millers' manager Ronnie Moore signing him on a free transfer. In his first season Watson helped Rotherham to promotion from League Two, narrowly missing out on the title.\nAnother promotion (and another title near miss) followed in the next season and Rotherham were promoted again into the Football League Championship. A key part of their rapid acceleration, Watson helped guide the team to survival by the narrowest of goal-difference margins.\nAfter over 100 games at Rotherham his knack for promotions was spotted by then Reading manager Alan Pardew who at first, took Watson on loan before signing him permanently in March 2002 for \u00a3150,000 \u2013 where he promptly repeated the trick, guiding the Royals to promotion from League One, in his now customary second place.\nHis first full season at Reading saw the Royals into a play-off place, where narrow defeat to Wolves cost them a place in the Premiership. Perhaps tellingly Watson was on the bench for those key play-off games.\nWhen former teammate Phil Parkinson was installed as manager at Colchester United one of his first acts was to bring Watson to Layer Road.\nMarshalling the midfield Watson played a key role as in his (and Parkinson's) first full season the U's stormed to promotion from League One, finishing in second place.\nNow with over 100 games for the U's under his belt he has been a key part of \"The Best Col U ever\" as the underdog U's finished their first season in the Football League Championship in 10th place.\nHe was released by Colchester at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, and then signed on a free transfer for Luton Town. However, Watson failed to make an impact at Luton as a result of a knee injury that kept him out of action for much of his contract duration, and he was released at the end of 2008.\nIn 2015 whilst assistant manager of Stevenage, Watson alongside Stevenage manager Teddy Sheringham registered as players.\n\nCoaching career\nAfter his release from a playing contract at Luton, Watson was given the position of first-team coach by Luton manager Mick Harford on 14 January 2009. After Harford's departure on 1 October 2009, Watson continued in his coaching capacity under new boss Richard Money until May 2010, when he left the club.Following the departure of Aidy Boothroyd from Colchester United to take the manager's job at Coventry City on 20 May 2010, Watson expressed an interest in taking up the vacant managerial position at his former club.In May 2015 he was appointed manager of Maldon & Tiptree However, Watson left the club after only eleven days to take up the position of assistant manager to Teddy Sheringham at Stevenage. He left his position in February after Teddy Sheringham's departure. From July 2015 to November 2015, he worked at the academy of Colchester United.\nIn August 2016, Watson was appointed assistant manager at Eastleigh. In January 2017 he was appointed to the same position at Whitehawk but left the club after just two games, following a change of manager. In March 2017 he was appointed manager of Bishop's Stortford. He left the club at the end of the 2017\u201318 season.On 28 June 2018, Watson was appointed assistant manager of Hungerford Town. He left the club on 2 October to join Ebbsfleet United as a first-team coach. However, only eight days later, he was appointed caretaker after manager Gary Hill's departure. After a three-game unbeaten run the club confirmed, that Watson had been appointed to the manager's job on a permanent basis.The club was beaten in the heaviest defeat in 27 years, 7\u20130 by Barrow on 4 January and also crashed out of the FA Trophy to lower league opponents Royston. Other heavy losses such as a 4\u20130 drubbing at Chesterfield away ultimately saw the club relegated out of the National League and Watson sacked.On 7 January 2021, Watson was announced as the new manager of National League South side Billericay Town.On 5 October 2021, Watson was sacked by Billericay after Watson led them to one win and one draw from eight matches to start the season.\n\nPersonal life\nWatson has been involved in greyhound racing, pairing up with Tottenham Hotspur teammate Stuart Nethercott to buy Elegant Brandy, who won the 1995 Grand National.\n\nHonours\nRotherham United\nFootball League Division Three runner-up: 1999\u20132000\nFootball League Division Two runner-up: 2000\u201301Reading\n\nFootball League Division Two runner-up: 2001\u201302Colchester United\n\nFootball League One runner-up: 2005\u201306\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").:\u200a85\u201386\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the H\u0101shim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.:\u200a61\u200a\n'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib and \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died six years after her husband's death. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad. But when Muhammad was eight years old, the very old Abd al-Muttalib became very sick and died at age 81-82 in 578-579 CE.\nShaybah ibn H\u0101shim's grave can be found in the Jannat al-Mu'all\u0101 cemetery in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nFamily tree of Shaiba ibn Hashim\nSahaba\nPassage 10:\nKevin Watson\nKevin Edward Watson (born 3 January 1974) is a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. After his retirement from playing, he turned non-league coach.\n\nPlaying career\nWatson started his career as a trainee with his local side Tottenham Hotspur. Watson scored his only Spurs goal on his debut in a League Cup tie against Brentford. As a youngster his first-team opportunities were limited and he went out on loan to several sides to build his experience, namely Brentford, Bristol City and Barnet.\nIn 1996, he was signed by Swindon Town manager Steve McMahon. Newly promoted to second tier of the English Football League \u2013 Watson helped them avoid relegation.\nWatson moved on to Rotherham United in July 1999, astute Millers' manager Ronnie Moore signing him on a free transfer. In his first season Watson helped Rotherham to promotion from League Two, narrowly missing out on the title.\nAnother promotion (and another title near miss) followed in the next season and Rotherham were promoted again into the Football League Championship. A key part of their rapid acceleration, Watson helped guide the team to survival by the narrowest of goal-difference margins.\nAfter over 100 games at Rotherham his knack for promotions was spotted by then Reading manager Alan Pardew who at first, took Watson on loan before signing him permanently in March 2002 for \u00a3150,000 \u2013 where he promptly repeated the trick, guiding the Royals to promotion from League One, in his now customary second place.\nHis first full season at Reading saw the Royals into a play-off place, where narrow defeat to Wolves cost them a place in the Premiership. Perhaps tellingly Watson was on the bench for those key play-off games.\nWhen former teammate Phil Parkinson was installed as manager at Colchester United one of his first acts was to bring Watson to Layer Road.\nMarshalling the midfield Watson played a key role as in his (and Parkinson's) first full season the U's stormed to promotion from League One, finishing in second place.\nNow with over 100 games for the U's under his belt he has been a key part of \"The Best Col U ever\" as the underdog U's finished their first season in the Football League Championship in 10th place.\nHe was released by Colchester at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, and then signed on a free transfer for Luton Town. However, Watson failed to make an impact at Luton as a result of a knee injury that kept him out of action for much of his contract duration, and he was released at the end of 2008.\nIn 2015 whilst assistant manager of Stevenage, Watson alongside Stevenage manager Teddy Sheringham registered as players.\n\nCoaching career\nAfter his release from a playing contract at Luton, Watson was given the position of first-team coach by Luton manager Mick Harford on 14 January 2009. After Harford's departure on 1 October 2009, Watson continued in his coaching capacity under new boss Richard Money until May 2010, when he left the club.Following the departure of Aidy Boothroyd from Colchester United to take the manager's job at Coventry City on 20 May 2010, Watson expressed an interest in taking up the vacant managerial position at his former club.In May 2015 he was appointed manager of Maldon & Tiptree However, Watson left the club after only eleven days to take up the position of assistant manager to Teddy Sheringham at Stevenage. He left his position in February after Teddy Sheringham's departure. From July 2015 to November 2015, he worked at the academy of Colchester United.\nIn August 2016, Watson was appointed assistant manager at Eastleigh. In January 2017 he was appointed to the same position at Whitehawk but left the club after just two games, following a change of manager. In March 2017 he was appointed manager of Bishop's Stortford. He left the club at the end of the 2017\u201318 season.On 28 June 2018, Watson was appointed assistant manager of Hungerford Town. He left the club on 2 October to join Ebbsfleet United as a first-team coach. However, only eight days later, he was appointed caretaker after manager Gary Hill's departure. After a three-game unbeaten run the club confirmed, that Watson had been appointed to the manager's job on a permanent basis.The club was beaten in the heaviest defeat in 27 years, 7\u20130 by Barrow on 4 January and also crashed out of the FA Trophy to lower league opponents Royston. Other heavy losses such as a 4\u20130 drubbing at Chesterfield away ultimately saw the club relegated out of the National League and Watson sacked.On 7 January 2021, Watson was announced as the new manager of National League South side Billericay Town.On 5 October 2021, Watson was sacked by Billericay after Watson led them to one win and one draw from eight matches to start the season.\n\nPersonal life\nWatson has been involved in greyhound racing, pairing up with Tottenham Hotspur teammate Stuart Nethercott to buy Elegant Brandy, who won the 1995 Grand National.\n\nHonours\nRotherham United\nFootball League Division Three runner-up: 1999\u20132000\nFootball League Division Two runner-up: 2000\u201301Reading\n\nFootball League Division Two runner-up: 2001\u201302Colchester United\n\nFootball League One runner-up: 2005\u201306", "answers": ["Edward Watson"], "pred": " 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 202", "length": 4625, "dataset": "2wikimqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "81cd47ec621f2228d8bb4ec351ffd6b23d23107e5b287ffb"}
{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nHenry de Bohun\nSir Henry de Bohun (died 23 June 1314) was an English knight, of Anglo-Norman origins, the grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. He was killed on the first day of the Battle of Bannockburn by Robert the Bruce.\nRiding in the vanguard of heavy cavalry, de Bohun caught sight of the Scottish king who was mounted on a small palfrey (ane gay palfray Li till and joly) armed only with a battle-axe.De Bohun lowered his lance and charged, but Bruce stood his ground, riding on towards the English knight. The two men sped towards each other (Sprent thai samyn intill a ling). At the last moment Bruce manoeuvred his mount nimbly to one side, stood up in his stirrups and hit de Bohun so hard with his axe that it cut through both Sir Henry's helmet and skull and into his brain (That ner the heid till the harnys clave). Despite the great risk the King had taken, he merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe.An iconic description and picture of the death of Henry de Bohun is contained in Scotland's Story by H. E. Marshall.\nPassage 2:\nEleanor de Bohun\nEleanor de Bohun (c.\u20091366 \u2013 3 October 1399) was the elder daughter and co-heiress (with her sister, Mary de Bohun), of  Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford (1341\u20131373) and Joan Fitzalan, a daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel and his second wife Eleanor of Lancaster.\n\nMarriage\nIn 1376, Eleanor married Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester. Thomas was the youngest son of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. Following their marriage, the couple went to reside in Pleshey Castle, Essex. According to Jean Froissart, Eleanor and her husband had the tutelage of her younger sister, Mary, who was being instructed in religious doctrine in the hope that she would enter a convent, thus leaving her share of the considerable Bohun inheritance to Eleanor and Thomas.\n\nIssue\nTogether Eleanor and Thomas had five children:\n\nHumphrey, 2nd Earl of Buckingham (c. 1381/1382 \u2013 2 September 1399)\nAnne of Gloucester (c. 1383 \u2013 1438) married (1st) Thomas Stafford, 3rd Earl of Stafford; (2nd) Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford; and (3rd) William Bourchier, Count of Eu. Her son by 3rd marriage, John Bourchier, 1st Baron Berners, was grandfather of Richard Neville, 2nd Baron Latimer of Snape.\nJoan (1384 \u2013 16 August 1400) married Gilbert Talbot, 5th Baron Talbot (1383\u20131419). Died in childbirth.\nIsabel (12 March 1385/1386 \u2013 April 1402), became a Minoress, later abbess, in a religious house near Aldgate\nPhilippa (c. 1388) Died young\n\nOrder of the Garter\nEleanor de Bohun was made a Lady of the Garter in 1384. She became a nun sometime after 1397 at Barking Abbey. Prior to her death, Eleanor divided her holdings among her children.  She died on 3 October 1399 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Her executors included the chaplain in Pleshy, Essex.\n\nIn fiction\nEleanor appears briefly in Anya Seton's historical romance Katherine, based upon the life of Eleanor's sister-in-law Katherine Swynford, the third wife of John of Gaunt. She also appears in Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare's Richard II, where she unsuccessfully urges John of Gaunt to avenge her murdered husband.\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nJohn de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley\nJohn de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley (20 June 1271 Cardiff \u2013 1312) was the son of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby and Alianore de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun and Eleanor de Braose, and granddaughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. He was both Seneschal of Gascony and Lieutenant of Aquitaine in 1312, the year of his death.Ferrers joined the baronial opposition to King Edward in 1297, but was summoned as a baron in 1299.He married Hawise de Muscegros, a daughter of Robert de Muscegros.Their eldest son John (died by 1324) inherited the title Baron Ferrers of Chartley upon his father's death from poisoning in Gascony in 1312.\nPassage 4:\nHumphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford\nHumphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford, 6th Earl of Essex, 2nd Earl of Northampton, KG (March 25, 1342 \u2013 January 16, 1373) was the son of William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, and Elizabeth de Badlesmere, and grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, by Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, daughter of King Edward I. He became heir to the Earldom of Hereford after the death of his childless uncle Humphrey de Bohun, 6th Earl of Hereford.\nFollowing King Peter I's visit to England, Humphrey participated in the sack of Alexandria in 1365.His wife and the mother of his daughters was Joan Fitzalan, daughter of Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel, and Eleanor of Lancaster, whom he married after 9 September 1359.\nOn his death, his estates were inherited by his two surviving daughters and his titles went into abeyance: \n\nEleanor de Bohun (1366 - 3 October 1399); married Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, youngest son of Edward III; mother of Anne of Gloucester.\nMary de Bohun, who married Henry Bolingbroke, the future King Henry IV of England.\nElizabeth de Bohun, died young.\nPassage 5:\nJohn de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford\nJohn de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford (23 November 1306 \u2013 20 January 1336) was born in St Clement's, Oxford to Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, a daughter of Edward I of England.\nAfter his father's death at the Battle of Boroughbridge, the family lands were forfeited. It was not until after the fall of the Despensers that John was permitted to succeed to his inherited position as Earl of Hereford and Essex, hereditary Constable of England, and Lord of Brecknock.\n\nMarriages\nHe married firstly, in 1325, to Alice FitzAlan (died 1326), daughter of Edmund FitzAlan, 2nd Earl of Arundel, and secondly to Margaret Basset (died 1355). After the marriage, it was discovered that the couple were related to the fourth degree of consanguinity and they were forced to live apart. An appeal to Pope John XXII resulted on 19 February 1331 in a papal commission to the bishops of Lichfield and London to hold an enquiry into the case. However, Roger Northburgh, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, failed to act and the case was still pending when the Pope issued a further demand for an enquiry in 1334.\n\nDeath\nHe did not play much of a public role, despite his high titles and offices, most likely because he had some sort of incapacity. His younger brothers were often deputed to fulfil his duties as Constable. He died at Kirkby Thore, Westmorland and was interred in Stratford Langthorne Abbey, London.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nEleanor de Braose\nEleanor de Braose (c. 1228\u20131251) was a Cambro-Norman noblewoman and a wealthy co-heiress of her father, who was the powerful Marcher lord William de Braose, and of her mother, Eva Marshal, a co-heiress of the Earls of Pembroke. Her husband was Humphrey de Bohun, heir of the 2nd Earl of Hereford, by whom she had children, including Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and Gilbert de Bohun.\n\nFamily\nEleanor was born in about 1228. She was the youngest of four daughters and a co-heiress of the powerful Marcher lord William de Braose, and Eva Marshal, both of whom held considerable lordships and domains in the Welsh Marches and Ireland. Eva was one of the daughters of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke by Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke, daughter of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, \"Strongbow\". Eleanor's three sisters were Isabella de Braose, Maud de Braose, Baroness Mortimer, and Eva de Braose, wife of William de Cantelou.While Eleanor was a young girl, her father - known to the Welsh as Gwilym Ddu (Black William) - was hanged on the orders of Llewelyn the Great, Prince of Wales for alleged adultery with Llewelyn's wife, Joan, Lady of Wales. Following the execution, her mother held de Braose lands and castles in her own right.\n\nMarriage and issue\nOn an unknown date after August 1241, Eleanor became the first wife of Humphrey de Bohun, the son of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford and Maud de Lusignan. The marriage took place after the death of Humphrey's mother, Maud.Humphrey and Eleanor had the following children:\n\nHumphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford (c.1249- 31 December 1298), married Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand II de Fiennes and Isabelle de Conde, by whom he had issue, including Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.\nGilbert de Bohun.(b.1251 - 1297) married Margarite had issue Gilbert (b.1302 d. 1381)His brother granted him Eleanor's lands in Ireland.\nEleanor de Bohun (died 20 February 1314, buried Walden Abbey).

She passed on her considerable possessions in the Welsh Marches to her eldest son Humphrey. Her husband survived her, married Joan de Quincy, and died in 1265.\n\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nWilliam de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton\nWilliam de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, KG (c. 1312 \u2013 16 September 1360) was an English nobleman and military commander.\n\nLineage\nHe was the fifth son of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan. He had a twin brother, Edward. His maternal grandparents were Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen consort Eleanor of Castile.\n\nLife\nWilliam de Bohun assisted at the arrest of Roger Mortimer in 1330, allowing Edward III to take power. After this, he was a trusted friend and commander of the king and he participated in the renewed wars with Scotland.In 1332, he received many new properties: Hinton and Spaine in Berkshire; Great Haseley, Ascott, Deddington, Pyrton and Kirtlington in Oxfordshire; Wincomb in Buckinghamshire; Longbenington in Lincolnshire; Kneesol in Nottinghamshire; Newnsham in Gloucestershire, Wix in Essex, and Bosham in Sussex.\nIn 1335, he married Elizabeth de Badlesmere (1313 \u2013 8 June 1356). Her parents Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, and Margaret de Clare had both turned against Edward II the decade before. Elizabeth and William were granted some of the property of Elizabeth's first husband, who had also been Mortimer's son and heir.\nWilliam was created Earl of Northampton in 1337, one of the six earls created by Edward III to renew the ranks of the higher nobility. Since de Bohun was a younger son, and did not have an income suitable to his rank, he was given an annuity until suitable estates could be found.\nIn 1349 he became a Knight of the Garter. He served as High Sheriff of Rutland from 1349 until his death in 1360.\n\nCampaigns in Flanders, Brittany, Scotland, Sluys and Crecy\nIn 1339 he accompanied the King to Flanders.  He served variously in Brittany and in Scotland, and was present at the great English victories at Sluys and Cr\u00e9cy, the latter as a commander. His most stunning feat was leading an English force to victory against a much bigger French force at the Battle of Morlaix in 1342. Some of the details are in dispute, but it is clear that he made good use of pit traps, which stopped the French cavalry.\n\nDiplomat\nIn addition to being a warrior, William was also a renowned diplomat.  He negotiated two treaties with France, one in 1343 and one in 1350. He was also charged with negotiating in Scotland for the freedom of King David Bruce, King of Scots, who was held prisoner by the English.\n\nSenior naval command\nFrom the 8 March 1352 to 5 March 1355 he was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas, Fleet.\n\nIssue\n1.

He was also an active participant in the Welsh Wars and maintained for several years a private feud with the earl of Gloucester. His father, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, fought on the side of the rebellious barons in the Barons' War. When Humphrey (V) predeceased his father, Humphrey (VI) became heir to his grandfather, Humphrey (IV). At Humphrey (IV)'s death in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. He also inherited major possessions in the Welsh Marches from his mother, Eleanor de Braose.\nBohun spent most of his early career reconquering marcher lands captured by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I's war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 1282\u201383 and 1294\u201395. At the same time he also had private feuds with other marcher lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford's final years were marked by the opposition he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and fiscal policy of Edward I. The conflict escalated to a point where civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the Confirmatio Cartarum\u2014a confirmation of Magna Carta\u2014and Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.\n\nFamily background and inheritance\nHumphrey (VI) de Bohun was part of a line of Anglo-Norman aristocrats going back to the Norman Conquest, most of whom carried the same name. His grandfather was Humphrey (IV) de Bohun, who had been part of the baronial opposition of Simon de Montfort, but later gone over to the royal side. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, but was restored to favour after the royalist victory at the Battle of Evesham the next year. Humphrey (IV)'s son, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, remained loyal to the baronial side throughout the Barons' War, and was captured at Evesham on 4 August 1265. In October of that year, Humphrey (V) died in captivity at Beeston Castle in Cheshire from injuries he had sustained in the battle.Humphrey (V) had been excluded from succession as a result of his rebellion, but when Humphrey (IV) died in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. Humphrey (VI) had already served as deputy Constable of England under Humphrey (IV). Humphrey (IV) had reserved the honour of Pleshey for his younger son Henry, but the remainder of his lands went to Humphrey (VI). The inheritance Humphrey (VI) received\u2014in addition to land in Essex and Wiltshire from Humphrey (IV)\u2014also consisted of significant holdings in the Welsh Marches from his mother. His mother Eleanor was a daughter and coheir of William de Braose and his wife Eva Marshal, who in turn was the daughter and co-heir of William Marshal, regent to Henry III.Since Humphrey (VI) was only sixteen years old at the time of his father's death, the Braose lands were taken into the king's custody until 1270. Part of this inheritance, the marcher lordship of Brecon, was in the meanwhile given to the custody of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford. Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political chaos in England to extend his territory into the Marches.He granted his brother Sir Gilbert de Bohun all of their mother's lands in Ireland and some land in England and Wales.\n\nWelsh Wars\nOver the next years, much of Hereford's focus was on reconquering his lost lands in the Marches, primarily through private warfare against Llywelyn. Henry III died in 1272, while his son\u2014now Edward I\u2014was crusading; Edward did not return until 1274. Llywelyn refused to pay homage to the new king, partly because of the military actions of Bohun and other marcher lords, which Llywelyn saw as violations of the Treaty of Montgomery. On 12 November 1276, Hereford was present at a royal assembly where judgment was passed on Llewelyn, and in 1277, Edward I declared war on the Welsh prince. Rebellion in his own Brecon lands delayed Hereford's participation in the early days of the Welsh war. He managed, however, to both suppress the rebellion and conquer lands further west. He then joined up with the royal army and served for a while in Anglesey, before returning to Brecon, where he received the surrender of certain Welsh lords. After the campaign was over, on 2 January 1278, he received protection from King Edward to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.In 1282, war with Wales broke out again; this time it would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a full-scale war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to fight the war with paid forces, but the nobility insisted on the use of the feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post-war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 1294\u201395, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.\n\nPrivate war in the Marches\nParallel with the Welsh Wars, Hereford was also struggling to assert his claims to lands in the Marches against other marcher lords. In 1284 Edward I granted the hundred of Iscennen in Carmarthenshire to John Giffard. Hereford believed the land belonged to him by right of conquest, and started a campaign to win the lands back, but the king took Giffard's side. Problems also arose with the earl of Gloucester. As Gloucester's former ward, Hereford had to buy back his own right of marriage, but Gloucester claimed he had not received the full sum. There was also remaining resentment on Hereford's part for his subordination to Gloucester in the 1282\u201383 campaign. The conflict came to a head when Gloucester's started construction of a castle at Morlais, which Hereford claimed was his land. In 1286, the Crown ordered Gloucester to cease, but to no avail.It had long been established Marches custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, and now he was facing open conflict with two different enemies. He, therefore, decided to take the issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offence was not the private warfare in itself, but the fact that the earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.In the end, the fines were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had nevertheless demonstrated an important point. After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the Marches lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the marcher lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was, therefore, a good opportunity to assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.\n\nOpposition to Edward I\nIn 1294 the French king declared the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and war broke out between the two countries. Edward I embarked on a wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on the Continent, and preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not in the company of the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.\n  \nAt the time of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was accompanying two of the king's daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reason for the magnates' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward's continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in the midst of an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances.Neither party showed any inclination to back down, and the nation seemed on the brink of another civil war. Just as the conflict was coming to a head, however, external events intervened to settle it. In September 1297, the English suffered a heavy defeat to the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The Scottish victory exposed the north of England to Scottish raids led by William Wallace. The war with Scotland received wider support from the English magnates, now that their own homeland was threatened, than did the war in France to protect the king's continental possessions. Edward abandoned his campaign in France and negotiated a truce with the French king. He agreed to confirm Magna Carta in the so-called Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of the Charters). The earls consequently consented to serve with the king in Scotland, and Hereford was in the army that won a decisive victory over the Scots in the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. Hereford, not satisfied that the king had upheld the charter, withdrew after the battle, forcing Edward to abandon the campaign.\n\nDeath and family\nIn 1275 Bohun married Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand de Fiennes, chevalier, seigneur of Fiennes, by his 2nd wife, Isabel (kinswoman of Queen Eleanor of Provence). She predeceased him, and was buried at Walden Priory in Essex. Hereford himself died at Pleshey Castle on 31 December 1298, and was buried at Walden alongside his wife. They had one son Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, born around 1276. The son was given possession of his father's lands and titles on 16 February 1299. The young Humphrey also inherited his father's title of Constable of England.A common theme in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce protection of what he regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, at the height of the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nHumphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford\nHumphrey IV de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, 1st Earl of Essex (1204 \u2013 24 September 1275) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and soldier who served as hereditary Constable of England.\n\nOrigins\nHe was the eldest son and heir of Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176\u20131220) by his wife Maud de Mandeville (alias Maud FitzGeoffrey), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex.\n\nCareer\nHe was one of the nine godfathers of Prince Edward, the future King Edward I. He served as Sheriff of Kent for 1239\u201340. In 1258, after returning from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Humphrey fell away, like his father, from the royal cause to that of the barons. He served as a nominee of the opposition on the \"committee of twenty-four\" which was appointed in the Oxford Parliament of that year, to create the Provisions of Oxford to reform the administration. The alliance of Simon de Montfort with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of North Wales brought Bohun back to royal allegiance. He headed the first secession of the Welsh Marchers from the party of the opposition (1263), and was among the captives whom the Montfortians took at the Battle of Lewes in 1264.He was amongst the victors at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, which extinguished the power of de Montfort, at which, however, his eldest son, Humphrey V de Bohun, was mortally wounded. Humphrey was selected as one of the twelve arbitrators to draw up the Dictum of Kenilworth (1266), by which the disinherited rebels were allowed to make their peace.\n\nMarriages and issue\nHe married twice:\n\nFirstly, in about 1236, to Maud de Lusignan (c. 1210 \u2013 14 August 1241), daughter of Raoul I of Lusignan, Comte d'Eu, second husband of Alix d'Eu, 8th Comtesse d'Eu. She died in 1241 and was buried at Llanthony, Gloucester, together with her husband. By Maud he had issue including:\nHumphrey V de Bohun (died 1265), eldest son and heir apparent, who predeceased his father, having shared with him in the victory at the Battle of Evesham (1264), which he did not long survive. The earldom, therefore, passed to his son Humphrey VI de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, 2nd Earl of Essex (c. 1249 \u2013 1298).\nHenry de Bohun\nGeoffrey de Bohun\nRalph de Bohun, Cleric;\nMaud de Bohun, who married firstly Anselm Marshal, 6th Earl of Pembroke; secondly Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester;\nAlice de Bohun, who married Roger V de Toeni;\nEleanor de Bohun, who married Sir John de Verdun, Baron of Westmeath\nSecondly, he married Maud de Avenbury (died 8 October 1273), by whom he had two further sons:\nJohn de Bohun\nSir Miles de Bohun\n\nDeath and burial\nHe died in 1275 in Warwickshire and was buried at Llanthony Secunda in Gloucester. He was succeeded by his grandson Humphrey VI de Bohun (c. 1249 \u2013 1298).\n\nNotes\nPassage 10:\nHenry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford\nHenry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176 \u2013 1 June 1220) of Pleshy Castle in Essex, was an Anglo-Norman nobleman who became Hereditary Constable of England from 1199.\n\nOrigins\nHe was the son and heir of Humphrey III de Bohun (pre-1144-1181) \nof Trowbridge Castle in Wiltshire and of Caldicot Castle in south-east Wales, 5th feudal baron of Trowbridge, who served King Henry II as Lord High Constable of England. His mother was Margaret of Huntingdon, widow of Conan IV, Duke of Brittany (d.1171) and a daughter of Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, son of King David I of Scotland by his wife Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon. Henry's half-sister was Constance, Duchess of Brittany.\n\nEarldom\nHis paternal grandmother was Margaret of Hereford, a daughter of Miles FitzWalter of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, Lord of Brecknock (died 1143), Sheriff of Gloucester and Constable of England. After the male line of Miles of Gloucester failed, in 1199 King John created Henry de Bohun Earl of Hereford and Constable of England. His lands lay chiefly on the Welsh Marches, and from this date the Bohuns took a foremost place among the Marcher barons.Henry de Bohun was one of the twenty-five barons elected by their peers to enforce the terms of Magna Carta in 1215. He was subsequently excommunicated by the Pope. In the civil war that followed Magna Carta, he was a supporter of King Louis VIII of France and was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1217.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married Maud de Mandeville (alias Maud FitzGeoffrey), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, of Pleshy Castle in Essex, by whom he had issue including:\n\nHumphrey IV de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, 1st Earl of Essex (1204-1275), eldest son and heir, created Earl of Essex in 1239, who married Maud de Lusignan, by whom he had at least three children.\nHenry de Bohun, who died young.\nRalph de Bohun.\n\nDeath\nHe died in June 1220 while on crusade to the Holy Land.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

He was killed on the first day of the Battle of Bannockburn by Robert the Bruce.\nRiding in the vanguard of heavy cavalry, de Bohun caught sight of the Scottish king who was mounted on a small palfrey (ane gay palfray Li till and joly) armed only with a battle-axe.De Bohun lowered his lance and charged, but Bruce stood his ground, riding on towards the English knight. The two men sped towards each other (Sprent thai samyn intill a ling). At the last moment Bruce manoeuvred his mount nimbly to one side, stood up in his stirrups and hit de Bohun so hard with his axe that it cut through both Sir Henry's helmet and skull and into his brain (That ner the heid till the harnys clave). Despite the great risk the King had taken, he merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe.An iconic description and picture of the death of Henry de Bohun is contained in Scotland's Story by H. E. Marshall.\nPassage 2:\nEleanor de Bohun\nEleanor de Bohun (c.\u20091366 \u2013 3 October 1399) was the elder daughter and co-heiress (with her sister, Mary de Bohun), of  Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford (1341\u20131373) and Joan Fitzalan, a daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel and his second wife Eleanor of Lancaster.\n\nMarriage\nIn 1376, Eleanor married Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester. Thomas was the youngest son of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. Following their marriage, the couple went to reside in Pleshey Castle, Essex. According to Jean Froissart, Eleanor and her husband had the tutelage of her younger sister, Mary, who was being instructed in religious doctrine in the hope that she would enter a convent, thus leaving her share of the considerable Bohun inheritance to Eleanor and Thomas.\n\nIssue\nTogether Eleanor and Thomas had five children:\n\nHumphrey, 2nd Earl of Buckingham (c. 1381/1382 \u2013 2 September 1399)\nAnne of Gloucester (c. 1383 \u2013 1438) married (1st) Thomas Stafford, 3rd Earl of Stafford; (2nd) Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford; and (3rd) William Bourchier, Count of Eu. Her son by 3rd marriage, John Bourchier, 1st Baron Berners, was grandfather of Richard Neville, 2nd Baron Latimer of Snape.\nJoan (1384 \u2013 16 August 1400) married Gilbert Talbot, 5th Baron Talbot (1383\u20131419).

She became a nun sometime after 1397 at Barking Abbey. Prior to her death, Eleanor divided her holdings among her children.  She died on 3 October 1399 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Her executors included the chaplain in Pleshy, Essex.\n\nIn fiction\nEleanor appears briefly in Anya Seton's historical romance Katherine, based upon the life of Eleanor's sister-in-law Katherine Swynford, the third wife of John of Gaunt. She also appears in Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare's Richard II, where she unsuccessfully urges John of Gaunt to avenge her murdered husband.\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nJohn de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley\nJohn de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley (20 June 1271 Cardiff \u2013 1312) was the son of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby and Alianore de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun and Eleanor de Braose, and granddaughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. He was both Seneschal of Gascony and Lieutenant of Aquitaine in 1312, the year of his death.Ferrers joined the baronial opposition to King Edward in 1297, but was summoned as a baron in 1299.He married Hawise de Muscegros, a daughter of Robert de Muscegros.Their eldest son John (died by 1324) inherited the title Baron Ferrers of Chartley upon his father's death from poisoning in Gascony in 1312.\nPassage 4:\nHumphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford\nHumphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford, 6th Earl of Essex, 2nd Earl of Northampton, KG (March 25, 1342 \u2013 January 16, 1373) was the son of William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, and Elizabeth de Badlesmere, and grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, by Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, daughter of King Edward I. He became heir to the Earldom of Hereford after the death of his childless uncle Humphrey de Bohun, 6th Earl of Hereford.\nFollowing King Peter I's visit to England, Humphrey participated in the sack of Alexandria in 1365.His wife and the mother of his daughters was Joan Fitzalan, daughter of Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel, and Eleanor of Lancaster, whom he married after 9 September 1359.\nOn his death, his estates were inherited by his two surviving daughters and his titles went into abeyance: \n\nEleanor de Bohun (1366 - 3 October 1399); married Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, youngest son of Edward III; mother of Anne of Gloucester.\nMary de Bohun, who married Henry Bolingbroke, the future King Henry IV of England.\nElizabeth de Bohun, died young.\nPassage 5:\nJohn de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford\nJohn de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford (23 November 1306 \u2013 20 January 1336) was born in St Clement's, Oxford to Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, a daughter of Edward I of England.\nAfter his father's death at the Battle of Boroughbridge, the family lands were forfeited. It was not until after the fall of the Despensers that John was permitted to succeed to his inherited position as Earl of Hereford and Essex, hereditary Constable of England, and Lord of Brecknock.\n\nMarriages\nHe married firstly, in 1325, to Alice FitzAlan (died 1326), daughter of Edmund FitzAlan, 2nd Earl of Arundel, and secondly to Margaret Basset (died 1355). After the marriage, it was discovered that the couple were related to the fourth degree of consanguinity and they were forced to live apart. An appeal to Pope John XXII resulted on 19 February 1331 in a papal commission to the bishops of Lichfield and London to hold an enquiry into the case. However, Roger Northburgh, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, failed to act and the case was still pending when the Pope issued a further demand for an enquiry in 1334.\n\nDeath\nHe did not play much of a public role, despite his high titles and offices, most likely because he had some sort of incapacity. His younger brothers were often deputed to fulfil his duties as Constable. He died at Kirkby Thore, Westmorland and was interred in Stratford Langthorne Abbey, London.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nEleanor de Braose\nEleanor de Braose (c. 1228\u20131251) was a Cambro-Norman noblewoman and a wealthy co-heiress of her father, who was the powerful Marcher lord William de Braose, and of her mother, Eva Marshal, a co-heiress of the Earls of Pembroke. Her husband was Humphrey de Bohun, heir of the 2nd Earl of Hereford, by whom she had children, including Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and Gilbert de Bohun.\n\nFamily\nEleanor was born in about 1228. She was the youngest of four daughters and a co-heiress of the powerful Marcher lord William de Braose, and Eva Marshal, both of whom held considerable lordships and domains in the Welsh Marches and Ireland. Eva was one of the daughters of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke by Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke, daughter of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, \"Strongbow\". Eleanor's three sisters were Isabella de Braose, Maud de Braose, Baroness Mortimer, and Eva de Braose, wife of William de Cantelou.While Eleanor was a young girl, her father - known to the Welsh as Gwilym Ddu (Black William) - was hanged on the orders of Llewelyn the Great, Prince of Wales for alleged adultery with Llewelyn's wife, Joan, Lady of Wales. Following the execution, her mother held de Braose lands and castles in her own right.\n\nMarriage and issue\nOn an unknown date after August 1241, Eleanor became the first wife of Humphrey de Bohun, the son of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford and Maud de Lusignan. The marriage took place after the death of Humphrey's mother, Maud.Humphrey and Eleanor had the following children:\n\nHumphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford (c.1249- 31 December 1298), married Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand II de Fiennes and Isabelle de Conde, by whom he had issue, including Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.\nGilbert de Bohun.(b.1251 - 1297) married Margarite had issue Gilbert (b.1302 d. 1381)His brother granted him Eleanor's lands in Ireland.\nEleanor de Bohun (died 20 February 1314, buried Walden Abbey).

She passed on her considerable possessions in the Welsh Marches to her eldest son Humphrey. Her husband survived her, married Joan de Quincy, and died in 1265.\n\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nWilliam de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton\nWilliam de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, KG (c. 1312 \u2013 16 September 1360) was an English nobleman and military commander.\n\nLineage\nHe was the fifth son of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan. He had a twin brother, Edward. His maternal grandparents were Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen consort Eleanor of Castile.\n\nLife\nWilliam de Bohun assisted at the arrest of Roger Mortimer in 1330, allowing Edward III to take power. After this, he was a trusted friend and commander of the king and he participated in the renewed wars with Scotland.In 1332, he received many new properties: Hinton and Spaine in Berkshire; Great Haseley, Ascott, Deddington, Pyrton and Kirtlington in Oxfordshire; Wincomb in Buckinghamshire; Longbenington in Lincolnshire; Kneesol in Nottinghamshire; Newnsham in Gloucestershire, Wix in Essex, and Bosham in Sussex.\nIn 1335, he married Elizabeth de Badlesmere (1313 \u2013 8 June 1356). Her parents Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, and Margaret de Clare had both turned against Edward II the decade before. Elizabeth and William were granted some of the property of Elizabeth's first husband, who had also been Mortimer's son and heir.\nWilliam was created Earl of Northampton in 1337, one of the six earls created by Edward III to renew the ranks of the higher nobility. Since de Bohun was a younger son, and did not have an income suitable to his rank, he was given an annuity until suitable estates could be found.\nIn 1349 he became a Knight of the Garter. He served as High Sheriff of Rutland from 1349 until his death in 1360.\n\nCampaigns in Flanders, Brittany, Scotland, Sluys and Crecy\nIn 1339 he accompanied the King to Flanders.  He served variously in Brittany and in Scotland, and was present at the great English victories at Sluys and Cr\u00e9cy, the latter as a commander. His most stunning feat was leading an English force to victory against a much bigger French force at the Battle of Morlaix in 1342. Some of the details are in dispute, but it is clear that he made good use of pit traps, which stopped the French cavalry.\n\nDiplomat\nIn addition to being a warrior, William was also a renowned diplomat.  He negotiated two treaties with France, one in 1343 and one in 1350. He was also charged with negotiating in Scotland for the freedom of King David Bruce, King of Scots, who was held prisoner by the English.\n\nSenior naval command\nFrom the 8 March 1352 to 5 March 1355 he was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas, Fleet.\n\nIssue\n1.

He was also an active participant in the Welsh Wars and maintained for several years a private feud with the earl of Gloucester. His father, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, fought on the side of the rebellious barons in the Barons' War. When Humphrey (V) predeceased his father, Humphrey (VI) became heir to his grandfather, Humphrey (IV). At Humphrey (IV)'s death in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. He also inherited major possessions in the Welsh Marches from his mother, Eleanor de Braose.\nBohun spent most of his early career reconquering marcher lands captured by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I's war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 1282\u201383 and 1294\u201395. At the same time he also had private feuds with other marcher lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford's final years were marked by the opposition he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and fiscal policy of Edward I. The conflict escalated to a point where civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the Confirmatio Cartarum\u2014a confirmation of Magna Carta\u2014and Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.\n\nFamily background and inheritance\nHumphrey (VI) de Bohun was part of a line of Anglo-Norman aristocrats going back to the Norman Conquest, most of whom carried the same name. His grandfather was Humphrey (IV) de Bohun, who had been part of the baronial opposition of Simon de Montfort, but later gone over to the royal side. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, but was restored to favour after the royalist victory at the Battle of Evesham the next year. Humphrey (IV)'s son, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, remained loyal to the baronial side throughout the Barons' War, and was captured at Evesham on 4 August 1265. In October of that year, Humphrey (V) died in captivity at Beeston Castle in Cheshire from injuries he had sustained in the battle.Humphrey (V) had been excluded from succession as a result of his rebellion, but when Humphrey (IV) died in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. Humphrey (VI) had already served as deputy Constable of England under Humphrey (IV). Humphrey (IV) had reserved the honour of Pleshey for his younger son Henry, but the remainder of his lands went to Humphrey (VI). The inheritance Humphrey (VI) received\u2014in addition to land in Essex and Wiltshire from Humphrey (IV)\u2014also consisted of significant holdings in the Welsh Marches from his mother. His mother Eleanor was a daughter and coheir of William de Braose and his wife Eva Marshal, who in turn was the daughter and co-heir of William Marshal, regent to Henry III.Since Humphrey (VI) was only sixteen years old at the time of his father's death, the Braose lands were taken into the king's custody until 1270. Part of this inheritance, the marcher lordship of Brecon, was in the meanwhile given to the custody of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford. Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political chaos in England to extend his territory into the Marches.He granted his brother Sir Gilbert de Bohun all of their mother's lands in Ireland and some land in England and Wales.\n\nWelsh Wars\nOver the next years, much of Hereford's focus was on reconquering his lost lands in the Marches, primarily through private warfare against Llywelyn. Henry III died in 1272, while his son\u2014now Edward I\u2014was crusading; Edward did not return until 1274. Llywelyn refused to pay homage to the new king, partly because of the military actions of Bohun and other marcher lords, which Llywelyn saw as violations of the Treaty of Montgomery. On 12 November 1276, Hereford was present at a royal assembly where judgment was passed on Llewelyn, and in 1277, Edward I declared war on the Welsh prince. Rebellion in his own Brecon lands delayed Hereford's participation in the early days of the Welsh war. He managed, however, to both suppress the rebellion and conquer lands further west. He then joined up with the royal army and served for a while in Anglesey, before returning to Brecon, where he received the surrender of certain Welsh lords. After the campaign was over, on 2 January 1278, he received protection from King Edward to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.In 1282, war with Wales broke out again; this time it would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a full-scale war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to fight the war with paid forces, but the nobility insisted on the use of the feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post-war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 1294\u201395, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.\n\nPrivate war in the Marches\nParallel with the Welsh Wars, Hereford was also struggling to assert his claims to lands in the Marches against other marcher lords. In 1284 Edward I granted the hundred of Iscennen in Carmarthenshire to John Giffard. Hereford believed the land belonged to him by right of conquest, and started a campaign to win the lands back, but the king took Giffard's side. Problems also arose with the earl of Gloucester. As Gloucester's former ward, Hereford had to buy back his own right of marriage, but Gloucester claimed he had not received the full sum. There was also remaining resentment on Hereford's part for his subordination to Gloucester in the 1282\u201383 campaign. The conflict came to a head when Gloucester's started construction of a castle at Morlais, which Hereford claimed was his land. In 1286, the Crown ordered Gloucester to cease, but to no avail.It had long been established Marches custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, and now he was facing open conflict with two different enemies. He, therefore, decided to take the issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offence was not the private warfare in itself, but the fact that the earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.In the end, the fines were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had nevertheless demonstrated an important point. After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the Marches lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the marcher lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was, therefore, a good opportunity to assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.\n\nOpposition to Edward I\nIn 1294 the French king declared the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and war broke out between the two countries. Edward I embarked on a wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on the Continent, and preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not in the company of the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.\n  \nAt the time of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was accompanying two of the king's daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reason for the magnates' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward's continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in the midst of an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances.Neither party showed any inclination to back down, and the nation seemed on the brink of another civil war. Just as the conflict was coming to a head, however, external events intervened to settle it. In September 1297, the English suffered a heavy defeat to the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The Scottish victory exposed the north of England to Scottish raids led by William Wallace. The war with Scotland received wider support from the English magnates, now that their own homeland was threatened, than did the war in France to protect the king's continental possessions. Edward abandoned his campaign in France and negotiated a truce with the French king. He agreed to confirm Magna Carta in the so-called Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of the Charters). The earls consequently consented to serve with the king in Scotland, and Hereford was in the army that won a decisive victory over the Scots in the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. Hereford, not satisfied that the king had upheld the charter, withdrew after the battle, forcing Edward to abandon the campaign.\n\nDeath and family\nIn 1275 Bohun married Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand de Fiennes, chevalier, seigneur of Fiennes, by his 2nd wife, Isabel (kinswoman of Queen Eleanor of Provence). She predeceased him, and was buried at Walden Priory in Essex. Hereford himself died at Pleshey Castle on 31 December 1298, and was buried at Walden alongside his wife. They had one son Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, born around 1276. The son was given possession of his father's lands and titles on 16 February 1299. The young Humphrey also inherited his father's title of Constable of England.A common theme in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce protection of what he regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, at the height of the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nHumphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford\nHumphrey IV de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, 1st Earl of Essex (1204 \u2013 24 September 1275) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and soldier who served as hereditary Constable of England.\n\nOrigins\nHe was the eldest son and heir of Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176\u20131220) by his wife Maud de Mandeville (alias Maud FitzGeoffrey), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex.\n\nCareer\nHe was one of the nine godfathers of Prince Edward, the future King Edward I. He served as Sheriff of Kent for 1239\u201340. In 1258, after returning from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Humphrey fell away, like his father, from the royal cause to that of the barons. He served as a nominee of the opposition on the \"committee of twenty-four\" which was appointed in the Oxford Parliament of that year, to create the Provisions of Oxford to reform the administration. The alliance of Simon de Montfort with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of North Wales brought Bohun back to royal allegiance. He headed the first secession of the Welsh Marchers from the party of the opposition (1263), and was among the captives whom the Montfortians took at the Battle of Lewes in 1264.He was amongst the victors at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, which extinguished the power of de Montfort, at which, however, his eldest son, Humphrey V de Bohun, was mortally wounded. Humphrey was selected as one of the twelve arbitrators to draw up the Dictum of Kenilworth (1266), by which the disinherited rebels were allowed to make their peace.\n\nMarriages and issue\nHe married twice:\n\nFirstly, in about 1236, to Maud de Lusignan (c. 1210 \u2013 14 August 1241), daughter of Raoul I of Lusignan, Comte d'Eu, second husband of Alix d'Eu, 8th Comtesse d'Eu. She died in 1241 and was buried at Llanthony, Gloucester, together with her husband. By Maud he had issue including:\nHumphrey V de Bohun (died 1265), eldest son and heir apparent, who predeceased his father, having shared with him in the victory at the Battle of Evesham (1264), which he did not long survive. The earldom, therefore, passed to his son Humphrey VI de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, 2nd Earl of Essex (c. 1249 \u2013 1298).\nHenry de Bohun\nGeoffrey de Bohun\nRalph de Bohun, Cleric;\nMaud de Bohun, who married firstly Anselm Marshal, 6th Earl of Pembroke; secondly Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester;\nAlice de Bohun, who married Roger V de Toeni;\nEleanor de Bohun, who married Sir John de Verdun, Baron of Westmeath\nSecondly, he married Maud de Avenbury (died 8 October 1273), by whom he had two further sons:\nJohn de Bohun\nSir Miles de Bohun\n\nDeath and burial\nHe died in 1275 in Warwickshire and was buried at Llanthony Secunda in Gloucester. He was succeeded by his grandson Humphrey VI de Bohun (c. 1249 \u2013 1298).\n\nNotes\nPassage 10:\nHenry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford\nHenry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176 \u2013 1 June 1220) of Pleshy Castle in Essex, was an Anglo-Norman nobleman who became Hereditary Constable of England from 1199.\n\nOrigins\nHe was the son and heir of Humphrey III de Bohun (pre-1144-1181) \nof Trowbridge Castle in Wiltshire and of Caldicot Castle in south-east Wales, 5th feudal baron of Trowbridge, who served King Henry II as Lord High Constable of England. His mother was Margaret of Huntingdon, widow of Conan IV, Duke of Brittany (d.1171) and a daughter of Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, son of King David I of Scotland by his wife Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon. Henry's half-sister was Constance, Duchess of Brittany.\n\nEarldom\nHis paternal grandmother was Margaret of Hereford, a daughter of Miles FitzWalter of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, Lord of Brecknock (died 1143), Sheriff of Gloucester and Constable of England. After the male line of Miles of Gloucester failed, in 1199 King John created Henry de Bohun Earl of Hereford and Constable of England. His lands lay chiefly on the Welsh Marches, and from this date the Bohuns took a foremost place among the Marcher barons.Henry de Bohun was one of the twenty-five barons elected by their peers to enforce the terms of Magna Carta in 1215. He was subsequently excommunicated by the Pope. In the civil war that followed Magna Carta, he was a supporter of King Louis VIII of France and was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1217.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married Maud de Mandeville (alias Maud FitzGeoffrey), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, of Pleshy Castle in Essex, by whom he had issue including:\n\nHumphrey IV de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, 1st Earl of Essex (1204-1275), eldest son and heir, created Earl of Essex in 1239, who married Maud de Lusignan, by whom he had at least three children.\nHenry de Bohun, who died young.\nRalph de Bohun.\n\nDeath\nHe died in June 1220 while on crusade to the Holy Land.", "answers": ["16 September 1360"], "pred": " 7th 7th 7th 7th 7th 7th 7th 7th 7th 7th 7", "length": 5001, "dataset": "2wikimqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "048e82b64b5651b74d452db7151c2110a718128dfd12a774"}

Cruickshanks is the father of Jamie Dundee and was the father-in-law of wrestler Bobby Eaton.\n\nCareer\nDundee was born in Angus, Scotland, and raised in Melbourne. At 16, he joined the circus as a trapeze artist. He started wrestling in Australia in 1962 and finally arrived in the United States as \"Superstar\" Bill Dundee in 1974 with his tag team partner George Barnes.\nDundee made a name for himself in the Memphis Territory, where he regularly teamed and feuded with Jerry Lawler and Jimmy Valiant for years. Dundee and Lawler ventured to the American Wrestling Association in 1987 and captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship twice.\nAs a singles wrestler, he held the Southern Heavyweight Championship belt several times from 1975 to 1985. Also, he had a successful team with \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Landel that wreaked havoc in Tennessee.\nDundee had a brief run in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions, Central States Wrestling and Florida Championship Wrestling in 1986, where he teamed with Jimmy Garvin and feuded with Sam Houston for the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship. He also briefly managed The Barbarian and The MOD Squad while in those territories.\nHe also had a run in World Championship Wrestling in the early 1990s as Sir William, the manager for Lord Steven Regal.\nDundee worked as a booker for Memphis, Louisiana and Georgia.\nDundee is still active as of 2019 in Memphis Wrestling, where he has been a heel and a baby face.

He played first-class cricket in Pakistan from 1961 to 1972. He scored 126 in the Third Test against New Zealand in Karachi in April 1965, when Pakistan needed 202 to win in five and half hours, and reached the target with a session to spare for the loss of only two wickets. He made his highest first-class score in December 1964, when he scored 154 against South Australia.He toured Australia a second time with the Pakistan team in 1972\u201373, but was injured early in the tour and omitted from the team before it left for the New Zealand leg of the tour. At the time he decided to stay in Australia to live, but he later returned to Pakistan. He served for a time as a national selector, but was dismissed in 2011 for allegedly violating the Pakistan Cricket Board's code of conduct.\n\nFamily\nHe is the father-in-law of Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal. Nazar Mohammad was his uncle.\nPassage 3:\nRosamund (wife of Alboin)\nRosamund (fl. 572) was a Lombard queen. She was the daughter of Cunimund, king of the Gepids, and wife of Alboin, king of the Lombards.\n\nLife\nRosamund was born into a kingdom in crisis, as the Gepid people had been fighting a losing battle against the Lombards since 546, firstly within the context of a Lombardic-East Roman alliance, and later against the Lombards and the Avar nomads. These wars had taken the lives of not only her grandfather king Thurisind, but also her uncle, Thurismund, both of which served to establish a long-standing hatred of the Lombards in her father, Cunimund, which he passed down to her.\nThis hatred was what spawned the final war of the Gepids, as Cunimund attempted to win back lost lands against the Lombards. The war, however, quickly turned, and in 567, the Gepid Kingdom would be completely subdued by a mixture of Lombard and Avar forces, her father was decapitated and she, along with many other Gepids, was taken as a prisoner of the Lombards (see Lombard\u2013Gepid War (567)). However, in an attempt to secure a male heir and following the death of his first wife Clotsuinda of Frankia, Alboin took her as his wife. Alboin was noted for his cruelty towards her; his most famous act of cruelty was reported by Paulus Diaconus, who states that at a royal banquet in Verona, Alboin forced her to drink from the skull of her dead father (which he carried around his belt), inviting her \"to drink merrily with her father\".\nAfter this, she began plotting to have her husband assassinated.  Thus, Rosamund met with the king's arms bearer and her lover, Helmichis, who suggested using Peredeo, \"a very strong man\", to accomplish the assassination. Peredeo refused to help, and that night mistakenly had intercourse with Rosamund, who was disguised as a servant. After learning that he had committed adultery with his king's wife, Peredeo agreed to take part in an assassination attempt in fear of the king's retribution. After the great feast, Alboin went to bed inebriated, at which point Rosamund ordered the king's sword bound to his bedpost, so that should he wake in the middle of the assassination attempt, he would be defenseless. Alboin did wake, only to find himself unarmed. He fended off his attackers temporarily with a footstool, but was killed. Due in part to the work of Paulus Diaconus, there seems to be some confusion about who actually killed Alboin, with both Helmichis and Peredeo assigned as sole murderer.Immediately afterwards, Helmichis planned to marry Rosamund and usurp the throne by claiming kingship. However, this plan gained little support from the various duchies of the Lombard kingdom, so Rosamund, Helmichis, and Albsuinda, Alboin's daughter by his first wife, fled together to the East Roman stronghold of Ravenna with a large proportion of Alboin's private treasures.  Rosamund and Helmichis married in Ravenna, but were soon divided when Rosamund, in an attempt to curry favour, took as a lover Longinus, the exarch, who had helped them plan the murder of Alboin. At the urging of Longinus, who promised to marry her, she attempted to murder her former lover Helmichis by poisoning, handing him the drink after he had washed; however, she was instead murdered by Helmichis, who forced her to drink the poison before committing suicide by the same means.\n\nRosamund in later culture\nRosamund would inspire many later tragedies, based on her life, particularly in Italy, where the folk song \"Donna Lumbarda\" was passed down orally through the generations, inspiring later renditions of the tale.\nShe's a heroine of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium (book 8).\nMedieval folk tales and legends developed. The first true tragedy, Giovanni Rucellai's Rosmunda, was first performed in 1525 and would serve as the basis for many later tellings of the story in the Italian language, such as Vittorio Alfieri's 1783 work of the same name and a Sam Benelli play of 1911. The conspiracy to murder Alboin also inspired the 1961/2 film Rosmunda e Alboino, aka Sword of the Conqueror etc., by Carlo Campogalliani.\nIn 1665 Urban Hj\u00e4rne wrote a comedy in Swedish on the same matter, Rosimunda. It is the first original play in that language known to have actually been staged, as entertainment for the young Charles XI while he studied at Uppsala university.\nIn the English language, the story would also be considered a tragedy, albeit more often neglected than in the Italian tradition, but it was the subject of Robert Burton Rodney's mid 19th C. poem Alboin and Rosamond, and would be treated by the pre-Raphaelite poet Algernon Charles Swinburne in his 1899 work Rosamund, Queen of the Lombards.\nIn Meg Cabot's young adult novel series The Princess Diaries published from 2000 on, Rosimunda is renamed 'Rosagunde'. While the story of her marriage to Alboin is the same, in Cabot's re-telling she is granted Genovia by the king of Italy as a reward for killing Alboin, making her the first princess of Genovia and an ancestor to the series' protagonist Mia Thermopolis.\n\nSee also\nCleopatra VII\nTheodora\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Rosamund at Wikimedia Commons\nPassage 4:\nLudwig von Westphalen\nJohann Ludwig von Westphalen (11 July 1770 \u2013 3 March 1842) was a liberal Prussian civil servant and the father-in-law of Karl Marx.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nJohann Ludwig von Westphalen was born on 11 July 1770 in Bornum am Elm. He was the youngest son of Philipp von Westphalen (1724\u201392), who himself was the son of a Blankenburg postmaster. Philipp von Westphalen had been ennobled in 1764 with the predicate Edler von Westphalen by Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick for his military services. He had served as the duke's de facto \"chief of staff\" during the Seven Years' War. Through his mother, Jane Wishart of Pittarrow, he was the descendant of many Scottish and European noble families.He received extensive education and spoke German and English, and read Latin, Greek, Italian, French and Spanish. He studied at the Collegium Carolinum, the forerunner of today's Braunschweig University of Technology, and at G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nCareer\nIn 1794, he entered government's service in Brunswick. In 1797 he married Elisabeth von Veltheim, who bore him four children. In 1804 he entered the government service of the Duchy of Brunswick and Lunenburg (Wolfenb\u00fcttel).\nWith the establishment of the Napoleonic state in Westphalia (the Kingdom of Westphalia) in 1807, he entered its service. He was likely motivated in this by a desire to see reforms carried out. He did, however, oppose the French dominance of the local government, and other policies, and for his critique he was eventually arrested by orders from Louis-Nicolas Davout and imprisoned in the fortress of Gifhorn. In the same year, he lost his first wife. In the summer of 1809 Louis was appointed sub-prefect of Salzwedel, where three years later in 1812 he married Karoline Heubel; they had three children. After Salzwedel was again under Prussian administration, in 1816 Ludwig von Westphalen was transferred to the newly established regional government in Trier.\n\nPersonal life\nIt was in Trier that he met and befriended Heinrich Marx, the father of Karl Marx. The children of the respective families, in particular Jenny and Edgar von Westphalen, and Sophie and Karl Marx, became close friends as well. In 1836, Jenny von Westphalen and Karl Marx became engaged; at first secretly but Ludwig approved the marriage in 1837, even though some saw Marx, who was both middle class and younger than her, as well as of Jewish descent, as an inappropriate partner for the noble daughter. In fact, Ludwig was seen as the mentor and role model of Karl Marx, who referred to him as a \"dear fatherly friend\". Ludwig filled Marx with enthusiasm for the romantic school and read him Homer and Shakespeare, who remained Marx's favorite authors all his life. Marx also read Voltaire and Racine with Ludwig. Ludwig devoted much of his time to the young Marx and the two went for intellectual walks through \"the hills and woods\" of the neighbourhood. It was Ludwig who first introduced Marx to the personality and socialist teachings of Saint-Simon. Marx dedicated his doctoral thesis \"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\" written in 1841 to Ludwig in a most effusive manner in which Marx wrote \"You, my fatherly friend, have always been for me the living proof that idealism is no illusion, but the true reality\" In 1842, Marx was present at the deathbed of Ludwig von Westphalen. Jenny and Karl became married in 1843, a year after Ludwig's death.\nHe was the father of Ferdinand von Westphalen, a conservative and reactionary Prussian Minister of the Interior.\n\nDeath\nHe died on 3 March 1842 in Trier.\nPassage 5:\nJames Armour (Master mason)\nJames Armour (15 January 1731 \u2013 20 September 1798) was a master mason and father of Jean Armour, and therefore the father-in-law of the poet Robert Burns. His birth year was shown here as 1730. The Scotland's People database has no record of this year of birth for a James Armour. Wikitree and several other data sources have his birth date as 10th/24th January 1731. The Scotland's People database has this record but showing his baptism on 24 January 1731. His birth on the original Old Parish Record is shown as 15 January 1731 to John Armour and Margrat(sic) Picken in Kilmarnock. James named his first son John which would normally be after James's father i.e. John. The chances of there being two James's born on exactly the same date exactly one year apart appear very remote and the naming of the first child seems to validate the conclusion that James Armour was born in 1731 and not 1730.\n\nLife and background\nAt Mauchline on 7 December 1761 he married Mary Smith, the daughter of stonemason Adam Smith. James died on 30 September 1798 and was buried in the family lair in Mauchline churchyard. His wife died in 1805 and was buried with her husband.\n\nFamily\nJames' eleven offspring with Mary, were, in birth order, John, Jean, James, Robert, Adam, Helen, Mary, Robert (2nd), Mary (2nd), Janet and Robert (3rd). Three siblings died in childhood. Dr John Armour was the eldest son who was born in Mauchline on 14 November 1762 and died in 1834. He had his practice in Kincardine-on-Forth where he died and was buried. He had two children, Janet and John, and married Janet Coventry on 10 March 1787. James and Mary's son James was born in Mauchline on 26 April 1767, married Betthaia Walker in 1794, Martha in 1818 and Janet in 1822. Their offspring were James and Betthaia. Adam Armour was named after Adam Smith, James Armour's father-in-law.The Armours' single-storey house stood in Cowgate, separated from John Dove's Whitefoord Arms by a narrow lane. Jean's bedroom window looked on to a window of the inn, thereby allowing Burns to converse with her from the public house itself. The Whitefoord Inn was often frequented by Burns and was also the meeting place of the so-called Court of Equity and linked to a significant incident in the life of Jean's brother Adam regarding the mistreatment of Agnes Wilson.\n\nOccupation and social standing\nJames was a master mason and contractor rather than an architect, regardless of Burns' attempts to describe him as one. He is known to have carried out contract work at Dumfries House near Cumnock and tradition links him to the building of Howford Bridge on the River Ayr, Greenan Bridge on the River Doon; Skeldon House, Dalrymple; and several other bridges in Ayrshire. Both the Armours and his wife's family had been stone-masons for several generations. William Burnes, Robert Burns' cousin, was apprenticed to James Armour.James was an adherent of the 'Auld Licht' style of religion and rented at 10/8 per year one of the most expensive pews in Mauchline church. James was rigid and austere, apparently living an exemplary life. Robert Burns-Begg, Burns' great-nephew, states that in contrast to her husband, Mary Armour was \"Partaken somewhat of the gay and frivolous.\".William 'Willie' Patrick, a source of many anecdotes about Robert and his family, stated about James that \"he was only a bit mason body, wha used to snuff a guid deal and gae afen tak a bit dram!\" He went on to say regarding James' attitude to Robert Burns that \"The thing was, he hated him, and would raither hae seen the Deil himsel comin to the hoose to coort his dochter than him! He cu'dna bear the sicht o'm, and that was the way he did it!\".\n\nAssociation with Robert Burns\nJames had disapproved of Burns's courtship of Jean, being aware of his affair with Elizabeth Paton, his 'New Licht' leanings and his poor financial situation. When informed in March 1786 by his distraught wife that Jean was pregnant he fainted and upon recovering consciousness and being given a strong cordial drink he enquired who the father was, fainting again when he was told that it was Robert Burns. The couple persuaded Jean to travel to Paisley and lodge with their relative Andrew Purdie, husband of her aunt Elizabeth Smith. Robert Wilson lived in Paisley, a possible suitor who had shown a romantic interest in Jean previously, appears to have been only part of the reason for this action, for on 8 April Mary Armour had vehemently denied to James Lamie, a member of the Kirk Session, that Jean was pregnant.\nRobert Burns produced a paper, probably a record of their \"Marriage by Declaration\" possibly witnessed by James Smith. This document, no longer extant, was defaced under James Armour's direction, probably by the lawyer Robert Aitken, with the names of both Robert and Jean being cut out. This act did not in fact effect its legality.  Robert wrote that James Armour's actions had \"...cut my very veins\", a feeling enhanced by Jean having handed over \"the unlucky paper\" and had agreed to go to Paisley.\nJames Armour in the meantime forced his daughter to sign a complaint and a warrant \"in meditatione fugae\" against Robert was issued to prevent his abandoning her. Burns fled to Old Rome Forest near Gatehead in South Ayrshire, where Jean Brown, Agnes Broun's half-sister and therefore an aunt of Burns, lived with her husband, James Allan.\nTwins were born to Jean and Robert on 3 September 1786, named after their parents as was the kirk's protocol for children born out of wedlock. Robert, notified of the birth by Adam Armour, that Sunday went to the Armour's house with a gift of tea, sugar and a Guinea that proved most acceptable.  Robert only returned from Edinburgh in the summer of 1787 to find that he was, thanks to his newly found fame as a published poet, actively welcomed into the family.\nJean however fell pregnant out of official wedlock once more, with the result that she felt forced to leave the Armour's home due to her father's anger. She was taken in by Willie Muir and his wife at Tarbolton Mill. It had previously been agreed that baby Jean would stay with her mother and baby Robert would join Bess at Mossgiel. The second set of twins did not live long and are buried, unnamed, in the Armour lair in Mauchline churchyard. Robert was in Edinburgh and did not arrive back until 23 February 1788; he then arranged accommodation for Jean.Whilst at the Brow Well Robert Burns wrote two of his last letters to his father-in-law asking that Mary Armour, who was away visiting relatives in Fife, be sent to Dumfries to help care for Jean who was heavily pregnant. On 10 July 1796 his last letter was signed \"Your most affectionate son. R. Burns.\"Upon the death of Robert Burnes his nephew Robert arranged for his cousin William to become a mason or building worker, working with James Armour, Burns' father-in-law.\n\nThe Inveraray marble Punch Bowl\nOf the many surviving Robert Burns artefacts few have such distinguished provenance as the punch bowl that was a nuptial gift in 1788 from James Armour to his daughter Jean and her new husband Robert Burns. As a stone-mason James had carved it himself (22cm x 14cm ) from dark green Inveraray marble and after residing at their various homes, Jean in 1801 presented it to her husband's great friend and Burns family benefactor Alexander Cunningham whilst she was on a visit to Edinburgh and staying with George Thomson. He had it mounted with a silver base and a rim, engraved upon which are the words \u201cYe whom social pleasure charms .. Come to my Bowl! Come to my arms, My FRIENDS, my BROTHERS!\u201d taken from Burns\u2019s \u201cThe Epistle to J. Lapraik.\u201dAlexander died in 1812 and it was then sold at auction in 1815 for the impressive price of 80 Guineas to a London publican who, falling upon hard times,  sold it to Archibald Hastie Esq of London. A copy is held by the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum at Alloway, whilst the original is in the British Museum in London, presented to that institution by Archibald Hastie in 1858.\n\nSee also\nAdam Armour\nJean Armour\nRobert Burnes\nWilliam Burnes\nPassage 6:\nPeter Burroughs\nPeter Burroughs (born 27 January 1947) is a British television and film actor and the director of Willow Management. He is the father-in-law of actor and TV presenter Warwick Davis.\n\nEarly career\nBurroughs initially ran a shop in his village at Yaxley, Cambridgeshire.\nHis first dramatic role was that of the character \"Branic\" in the 1979 television series The Legend of King Arthur. He also acted in the television shows Dick Turpin, The Goodies, Doctor Who in the serial The King's Demons and One Foot in the Grave.\n\nFilm career\nBurroughs played roles in Hollywood movies such as Flash Gordon, George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi (a swinging ewok), Willow, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In 1995, Burroughs set up Willow Management, an agency for short actors, along with co-actor Warwick Davis. He portrayed a bank goblin in the Harry Potter series (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2).\n\nPersonal life\nHis daughter Samantha (born 1971), is married to Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi and Willow film star Warwick Davis. He has another daughter, Hayley Burroughs, who is also an actress. His granddaughter is Annabelle Davis.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 7:\nHelmichis\nHelmichis (fl. 572) was a Lombard noble who killed his king, Alboin, in 572 and unsuccessfully attempted to usurp his throne. Alboin's queen, Rosamund, supported or at least did not oppose Helmichis' plan to remove the king, and after the assassination Helmichis married her. The assassination was assisted by Peredeo, the king's chamber-guard, who in some sources becomes the material executer of the murder. Helmichis is first mentioned by the contemporary chronicler Marius of Avenches, but the most detailed account of his endeavours derives from Paul the Deacon's  late 8th-century Historia Langobardorum.\nThe background to the assassination begins when Alboin killed the king of the Gepids in 567 and captured the king's daughter Rosamund. Alboin then led his people into Italy, and by 572 had settled himself in Verona, which made him vulnerable to the ambitions of other prominent Lombards, such as Helmichis, who was Alboin's foster-brother and arms-bearer.  After Alboin's death, Helmichis attempted to gain the throne. He married Rosamund to legitimize his position as new king, but immediately faced stiff opposition from his fellow Lombards who suspected Helmichis of conniving with the Byzantines; this hostility eventually focused around the duke of Ticinum Cleph, supporter of an aggressive policy towards the Empire.\nRather than going to war, Helmichis, Rosamund and their followers escaped to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis in order to be free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.\n\nBackground\nThe oldest author to write about Helmichis is the contemporary chronicler Marius of Avenches. In his account he mentions that \"Alboin was killed by his followers, that is Hilmaegis with the rest, his wife agreeing to it\". Marius continues by adding that, after killing the king, Helmichis married his widow and tried unsuccessfully to gain the throne. His attempt failed and he was forced to escape together with his wife, the royal treasure and the troops that had sided with him in the coup. This account has strong similarities with what is told in the Origo. The Origo would in its turn become a direct source for the Historia Langobardorum.The background to the assassination begins when Alboin, king of the Lombards, a Germanic people living in Pannonia (in the region of modern Hungary), went to war against the neighbouring Gepids in 567. In a decisive battle, Alboin killed the Gepid king Cunimund and captured the king's daughter Rosamund \u2013 later marrying her to guarantee the loyalty of the surviving Gepids. The following year, the Lombards migrated to Italy, a territory then held by the Byzantine Empire. In 569 Alboin took Mediolanum (Milan), the capital of northern Italy, and by 570 he had assumed control of most of northern Italy. The Byzantine forces entrenched themselves in the strategic town of Ticinum (Pavia), which they took only after a long siege. Even before taking Ticinum, the Lombards crossed the Apennines and invaded Tuscia. After the fall of Ticinum, Alboin chose Verona as his first permanent headquarters. In this town Alboin was assassinated in 572 and it is in these circumstances that Helmichis' name is first heard of. Most of the available details are in the Historia Langobardorum.\n\nAssassination\nBy settling himself in Verona and temporarily interrupting his chain of conquests, Alboin had weakened his popular standing as a charismatic warrior king. The first to take advantage of this was Rosamund, who could count on the support of the Gepid warriors in the town in her search for an opportunity to avenge the death of her father. To obtain this goal she persuaded Helmichis, spatharius (arms bearer) and foster brother of the king, and also head of a personal armed retinue in Verona, to take part in a plot to eliminate Alboin and replace him on the throne. Helmichis persuaded Rosamund to involve Peredeo, described by Paul simply as \"a very strong man\", who was seduced through a trick by the Queen and forced to consent to become the actual assassin.This story is partly in conflict with what is told by the Origo, which has Peredeo acting as an instigator and not as the murderer. In a similar vein to the Origo is the account of Peredeo contained in the Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani, where it is added that Peredeo was Alboin's \"chamber-guard\", hinting that in the original version of the story Peredeo's role may just have been to let in the real assassin, who is Helmichis in Agnellus' account, as it had been in that of Marius. However, the primary intent of the Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani may have been to obtain a more straightforward and coherent narrative by reducing the number of actors in the story, beginning with Peredeo. The disappearance of Peredeo, however, means that the role of Helmichis changes: while Paul presents him as \"the efficient conspirator and killer\", with Agnellus he is a victim of a ruthless and domineering queen.According to historian Paolo Delogu it may be that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard oral tradition than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.After the king's death on June 28, 572, Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona. The marriage was important for Helmichis: it legitimized his rule because, judging from Lombard history, royal prerogatives could be inherited by marrying the king's widow; and the marriage was a guarantee for Helmichis of the loyalty of the Gepids in the army, who sided with the queen since she was Cunimund's daughter.\n\nFailure\nBehind the coup were almost certainly the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if not from a pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or he may have been related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.Helmichis' coup ultimately failed because it met strong opposition from the many Lombards who wanted to continue the war against the Byzantines and to confront the regicides. Faced with the prospect of going to war at overwhelming odds, Helmichis asked for help from the Byzantines. The praetorian prefect Longinus enabled him to avoid a land route possibly held by hostile forces, by shipping him instead down the Po to Byzantine-held Ravenna, together with his wife, his Lombard and Gepid troops, the royal treasure and Albsuinda. Bognetti believes that Longinus may have planned to make the Lombards weaker by depriving them of any legitimate heir. In addition, because of the ongoing war, it was hard to assemble all the warriors to elect a new king formally. This plan was brought to nothing by the troops stationed in Ticinum, who elected their duke Cleph king, having it in mind to continue Alboin's aggressive policy. In contrast, Wolfram argues that Cleph was elected in Ticinum while Helmichis was still making his bid for the crown in Verona.\n\nDeath\nOnce in Ravenna, Helmichis and Rosamund rapidly became estranged. According to Paul, Longinus persuaded Rosamund to get rid of her husband so that he could marry her. To accomplish this, she made him drink a cup full of poison; before dying, however, Helmichis understood what his wife had done and forced her to drink the cup too, so they both died. According to Wolfram, there may be some historical truth in the account of Longinus' proposal to Rosamund, as it was possible to achieve Lombard kingship by marrying the queen, but the story of the two lovers' end is not historical but legendary. The mutual murder as told by Agnellus is given a different interpretation by Joaquin Martinez Pizarro: he sees Helmichis' last action as a symbol of how the natural hierarchy of sexes is at last restored, after the queen's actions had unnaturally modified the proper equilibrium.At this point, Longinus sent the royal treasure and Albsuinda to Constantinople, the Empire's capital, together with Helmichis' forces, which were to become Byzantine mercenaries. This was a common Byzantine strategy, already applied previously to the Ostrogoths, by which large national contingents were relocated to be used in other theatres. These are believed to be the same 60,000 Lombards that are attested by John of Ephesus as being active in Syria in 575 against the Persians. As for Albsuinda, the Byzantine diplomacy probably aimed to use her as a political tool to impose a pro-Byzantine king on the Lombards. According to Agnellus, once Longinus' actions came to the attention of emperor Justin II they were greatly praised, and the emperor gave lavish gifts to his official.Cleph kept his throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed him, opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only when faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.\n\nEarly Middle Ages sources\nAmong the surviving Early Middle Ages sources, there are six that mention Helmichis by name. Of these, the only contemporary one is the Chronica of Marius of Avenches, written in the 580s. Marius was bishop of Aventicum, a town located in the western Alps in the Frankish Kingdom of Burgundy. Because of the small distance from Aventicum to the Italian peninsula, the chronicler had easy access to information regarding northern Italy. For this reason, historian Roger Collins considers the Chronica, though short, to be reliable on Italian matters. The remaining sources all come from Italy and were written in later centuries. Two of them were written in the 7th century, the Continuatio Havniensis Prosperi and the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, both anonymous. The Continuatio is a chronicle written around 625 that has reached us in a single manuscript. As its name suggests, it is a continuation of the 5th century chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine. Derived in considerable measure from the Chronica Majora of Isidore of Seville, it blames the Romans for their inability to defend Italy from foreign invaders, and praises the Lombards for defending the country from the Franks. This is the earliest surviving work to name Rosamund, the queen of the Lombards who plays a central role in Helmichis' attested biography. The other 7th century work, the Origo, is a brief prose history of the Lombards that is essentially an annotated king list, although it begins with a description of the founding myth of the Lombard nation. Giorgio Ausenda believes that the Origo was written around 643 as a prologue to the Edictum Rothari, and continued to be updated till 671. According to Walter Pohl, the author's motives are mostly political: the Origo serves to consolidate the Lombards' national identity by emphasising a shared history. Apart from the origin myth, the only more detailed account is the one concerning the death of Alboin, and thus Helmichis.For the events surrounding 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, a history of the Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished in the last two decades of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nJohn Adams (merchant)\nJohn Adams (1672 or 1673 \u2013 c. 1745) was an American-born Canadian merchant and member of the Nova Scotia Council. He was the father-in-law of Henry Newton.\n\nBiography\nAdams was born in Boston in either 1672 or 1673 to John and Avis Adams. Growing up as a petty merchant, Adams joined Sir Charles Hobby's New England regiment, participating in the capture of Port-Royal in 1710. Shortly thereafter, Adams settled in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, returning to civilian life. There, he traded manufactured goods with the province's Acadian and Native Americans, and took up the role of a real estate agent and contractor. Adams joined the Executive Council of Nova Scotia on 28 April 1720, holding his position there for 20 years; the records show that few served as long as he did. He also held several other public positions in the province. Adams was appointed a notary public and deputy collector of customs for Annapolis Royal in 1725, and he was commissioned a justice of the peace in March 1727.Around the mid-1720s, Adams' poor eyesight began to fail, leading to his near-blindness in 1730. After this, he was less active in community activities and trade. Adams petitioned to the king for a pension several times, but failed. He blamed his disability on over-exposure to the sun during an Indian attack on Annapolis Royal in 1724. In December 1739, Lieutenant Governor Lawrence Armstrong died. With the absence of Major Mascarene to take Armstrong's place, Adams became the new president of the council and head of the civil government. (Alexander Cosby was also vying for the position.) In a meeting on 22 March 1740, with the return of Mascarene, the councilors declared that he was the council's rightful president. This turn of events led Adams to retire to Boston in late August or early September 1740, where he stayed for the rest of his life. He died some time after 1745.\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nOgawa Mataji\nViscount Ogawa Mataji (\u5c0f\u5ddd\u53c8\u6b21, 22 August 1848 \u2013 20 October 1909) was a general in the early Imperial Japanese Army.

In March 1882, he was chief of staff of the Hiroshima Garrison. Promoted to colonel in October 1884, he was assigned the IJA 8th Infantry Regiment. In May 1885, he joined the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. German General Jakob Meckel, hired by the Japanese government as a foreign advisor and instructor in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy highly praised Ogawa and fellow colonel Kodama Gentar\u014d as the two most outstanding officers in the Imperial Japanese Army. Ogawa was especially noted for his abilities as a military strategist and planner, and earned the sobriquet \u201cthe modern Kenshin\") from General Kawakami Soroku.\n\nFirst Sino-Japanese War\nOgawa was promoted to major general in June 1890, and given command of the IJA 4th Infantry Brigade, followed by command of the 1st Guards Brigade. At the start of the First Sino-Japanese War in August 1894, he was chief of staff of the Japanese First Army. In August 1895, he was elevated to the kazoku peerage with the title of danshaku (baron).

He started wrestling in Australia in 1962 and finally arrived in the United States as \"Superstar\" Bill Dundee in 1974 with his tag team partner George Barnes.\nDundee made a name for himself in the Memphis Territory, where he regularly teamed and feuded with Jerry Lawler and Jimmy Valiant for years. Dundee and Lawler ventured to the American Wrestling Association in 1987 and captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship twice.\nAs a singles wrestler, he held the Southern Heavyweight Championship belt several times from 1975 to 1985. Also, he had a successful team with \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Landel that wreaked havoc in Tennessee.\nDundee had a brief run in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions, Central States Wrestling and Florida Championship Wrestling in 1986, where he teamed with Jimmy Garvin and feuded with Sam Houston for the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship. He also briefly managed The Barbarian and The MOD Squad while in those territories.\nHe also had a run in World Championship Wrestling in the early 1990s as Sir William, the manager for Lord Steven Regal.\nDundee worked as a booker for Memphis, Louisiana and Georgia.\nDundee is still active as of 2019 in Memphis Wrestling, where he has been a heel and a baby face. He frequently appears on Jackson, Tennessee, talk radio station WNWS 101.5 with Dan Reeves and on a talk show on Public-access television cable TV channels in West Tennessee. He still promotes indy cards across Tennessee and in Southaven, Mississippi. He currently runs a podcast on Anchor named If You Don't Want the Answer, Don't Ask the Question.\nOn 20 July 2019, Dundee, at 75 years old, defeated Tony Deppen to win the unofficial WOMBAT Television Championship for Game Changer Wrestling in Tullahoma, Tennessee.\n\nBooks\nIf You Don't Want The Answer, Don't Ask The Question: Bill Dundee's Life Story\n\nPersonal life\nDundee's son Jamie Dundee, also became a wrestler, whereas his daughter Donna, married wrestler Bobby Eaton. His grandson, Dylan Eaton, wrestles as well.\nIn the early 1990s he partnered with Doug Hurt, brother of Jerry Lawler's manager, in the opening of a furniture store in Evansville, Indiana called \"Superstar Dundee Furniture\". The store collapsed about a year after opening.\nOn 26 June 2021, his daughter Donna died at the age of 57 from breast cancer. Just over a month later, his son-in-law Bobby Eaton died on 4 August 2021 at the age of 62, just two weeks after suffering a fall at his home.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nAmerican Wrestling Federation\nAWF Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nCentral States Wrestling\nNWA Central States Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nMemphis Wrestling Hall of Fame\nClass of 2017\nMid-South Wrestling Association\nMid-South Television Championship (1 time)\nNWA Mid-America / Continental Wrestling Association / Championship Wrestling Association\nAWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (9 times)\nAWA Southern Tag Team Championship (14 times) \u2013 with Norvell Austin (1), Robert Gibson (1), Jerry Lawler (4), Robert Fuller (1), Tommy Rich (2), Dream Machine (2), Steve Keirn (2) and Dutch Mantel (1)\nAWA World Tag Team Championship (2 times) \u2013 with Jerry Lawler1\nCWA International Heavyweight Championship (4 times)\nCWA International Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Rocky Johnson\nCWA Southwestern Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nCWA World Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nCWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Tommy Rich\nNWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nNWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Ricky Gibson\nNWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Memphis version) (1 time)\nNWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version) (3 times) \u2013 with Big Bad John (2) and Tommy Rich (1)\nNWA United States Junior Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\nOhio Valley Wrestling\nOVW Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nPower Pro Wrestling\nPPW Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Jerry Lawler\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nRanked No. 56 of the 100 top tag teams of the \"PWI Years\" with Jerry Lawler in 2003\nPro Wrestling This Week\nWrestler of the Week (21\u201327 June 1987)\nSoutheastern Championship Wrestling\nNWA Southeastern Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Tommy Rich\nNWA United States Junior Heavyweight Championship (Southeastern version) (1 time)\nSupreme Wrestling\nSupreme Mid-America Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Rob Royale\nUnited States Wrestling Association\nUSWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nUSWA Junior Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\nUSWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (3 times)\nUSWA Texas Heavyweight Championship (3 times)\nUSWA World Tag Team Championship (3 times) \u2013 with Jerry Lawler (2) and Jamie Dundee (1)\nWOMBAT Wrestling\nWOMBAT Television Championship (1 time, current)\nWorld Class Wrestling Association\nCWA Southwestern Heavyweight Championship (2 times)21Dundee's and Lawler's reigns with the AWA World Tag Team Championship began on cards hosted by the CWA through the interpromotional relationship between the AWA and CWA that also allowed the defense of the AWA Southern Heavyweight and Southern Tag Team Championships primarily within the CWA.2The CWA Southwestern Heavyweight Championship was promoted in both the CWA and WCWA while the promotions had a working relationship in 1989 and 1990.\nPassage 2:\nMohammad Ilyas (cricketer)\nMohammad Ilyas Mahmood  (Urdu: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f ; born 19 March 1946) is a former Pakistani cricketer who played in ten Test matches between 1964 and 1969.\n\nCricket career\nIlyas was an opening batsman and occasional leg-spin bowler. He played first-class cricket in Pakistan from 1961 to 1972. He scored 126 in the Third Test against New Zealand in Karachi in April 1965, when Pakistan needed 202 to win in five and half hours, and reached the target with a session to spare for the loss of only two wickets. He made his highest first-class score in December 1964, when he scored 154 against South Australia.He toured Australia a second time with the Pakistan team in 1972\u201373, but was injured early in the tour and omitted from the team before it left for the New Zealand leg of the tour. At the time he decided to stay in Australia to live, but he later returned to Pakistan. He served for a time as a national selector, but was dismissed in 2011 for allegedly violating the Pakistan Cricket Board's code of conduct.\n\nFamily\nHe is the father-in-law of Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal. Nazar Mohammad was his uncle.\nPassage 3:\nRosamund (wife of Alboin)\nRosamund (fl. 572) was a Lombard queen. She was the daughter of Cunimund, king of the Gepids, and wife of Alboin, king of the Lombards.\n\nLife\nRosamund was born into a kingdom in crisis, as the Gepid people had been fighting a losing battle against the Lombards since 546, firstly within the context of a Lombardic-East Roman alliance, and later against the Lombards and the Avar nomads. These wars had taken the lives of not only her grandfather king Thurisind, but also her uncle, Thurismund, both of which served to establish a long-standing hatred of the Lombards in her father, Cunimund, which he passed down to her.\nThis hatred was what spawned the final war of the Gepids, as Cunimund attempted to win back lost lands against the Lombards. The war, however, quickly turned, and in 567, the Gepid Kingdom would be completely subdued by a mixture of Lombard and Avar forces, her father was decapitated and she, along with many other Gepids, was taken as a prisoner of the Lombards (see Lombard\u2013Gepid War (567)). However, in an attempt to secure a male heir and following the death of his first wife Clotsuinda of Frankia, Alboin took her as his wife. Alboin was noted for his cruelty towards her; his most famous act of cruelty was reported by Paulus Diaconus, who states that at a royal banquet in Verona, Alboin forced her to drink from the skull of her dead father (which he carried around his belt), inviting her \"to drink merrily with her father\".\nAfter this, she began plotting to have her husband assassinated.  Thus, Rosamund met with the king's arms bearer and her lover, Helmichis, who suggested using Peredeo, \"a very strong man\", to accomplish the assassination. Peredeo refused to help, and that night mistakenly had intercourse with Rosamund, who was disguised as a servant. After learning that he had committed adultery with his king's wife, Peredeo agreed to take part in an assassination attempt in fear of the king's retribution. After the great feast, Alboin went to bed inebriated, at which point Rosamund ordered the king's sword bound to his bedpost, so that should he wake in the middle of the assassination attempt, he would be defenseless. Alboin did wake, only to find himself unarmed. He fended off his attackers temporarily with a footstool, but was killed. Due in part to the work of Paulus Diaconus, there seems to be some confusion about who actually killed Alboin, with both Helmichis and Peredeo assigned as sole murderer.Immediately afterwards, Helmichis planned to marry Rosamund and usurp the throne by claiming kingship. However, this plan gained little support from the various duchies of the Lombard kingdom, so Rosamund, Helmichis, and Albsuinda, Alboin's daughter by his first wife, fled together to the East Roman stronghold of Ravenna with a large proportion of Alboin's private treasures.  Rosamund and Helmichis married in Ravenna, but were soon divided when Rosamund, in an attempt to curry favour, took as a lover Longinus, the exarch, who had helped them plan the murder of Alboin. At the urging of Longinus, who promised to marry her, she attempted to murder her former lover Helmichis by poisoning, handing him the drink after he had washed; however, she was instead murdered by Helmichis, who forced her to drink the poison before committing suicide by the same means.\n\nRosamund in later culture\nRosamund would inspire many later tragedies, based on her life, particularly in Italy, where the folk song \"Donna Lumbarda\" was passed down orally through the generations, inspiring later renditions of the tale.\nShe's a heroine of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium (book 8).\nMedieval folk tales and legends developed. The first true tragedy, Giovanni Rucellai's Rosmunda, was first performed in 1525 and would serve as the basis for many later tellings of the story in the Italian language, such as Vittorio Alfieri's 1783 work of the same name and a Sam Benelli play of 1911. The conspiracy to murder Alboin also inspired the 1961/2 film Rosmunda e Alboino, aka Sword of the Conqueror etc., by Carlo Campogalliani.\nIn 1665 Urban Hj\u00e4rne wrote a comedy in Swedish on the same matter, Rosimunda. It is the first original play in that language known to have actually been staged, as entertainment for the young Charles XI while he studied at Uppsala university.\nIn the English language, the story would also be considered a tragedy, albeit more often neglected than in the Italian tradition, but it was the subject of Robert Burton Rodney's mid 19th C. poem Alboin and Rosamond, and would be treated by the pre-Raphaelite poet Algernon Charles Swinburne in his 1899 work Rosamund, Queen of the Lombards.\nIn Meg Cabot's young adult novel series The Princess Diaries published from 2000 on, Rosimunda is renamed 'Rosagunde'. While the story of her marriage to Alboin is the same, in Cabot's re-telling she is granted Genovia by the king of Italy as a reward for killing Alboin, making her the first princess of Genovia and an ancestor to the series' protagonist Mia Thermopolis.\n\nSee also\nCleopatra VII\nTheodora\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Rosamund at Wikimedia Commons\nPassage 4:\nLudwig von Westphalen\nJohann Ludwig von Westphalen (11 July 1770 \u2013 3 March 1842) was a liberal Prussian civil servant and the father-in-law of Karl Marx.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nJohann Ludwig von Westphalen was born on 11 July 1770 in Bornum am Elm. He was the youngest son of Philipp von Westphalen (1724\u201392), who himself was the son of a Blankenburg postmaster. Philipp von Westphalen had been ennobled in 1764 with the predicate Edler von Westphalen by Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick for his military services. He had served as the duke's de facto \"chief of staff\" during the Seven Years' War. Through his mother, Jane Wishart of Pittarrow, he was the descendant of many Scottish and European noble families.He received extensive education and spoke German and English, and read Latin, Greek, Italian, French and Spanish. He studied at the Collegium Carolinum, the forerunner of today's Braunschweig University of Technology, and at G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nCareer\nIn 1794, he entered government's service in Brunswick. In 1797 he married Elisabeth von Veltheim, who bore him four children. In 1804 he entered the government service of the Duchy of Brunswick and Lunenburg (Wolfenb\u00fcttel).\nWith the establishment of the Napoleonic state in Westphalia (the Kingdom of Westphalia) in 1807, he entered its service. He was likely motivated in this by a desire to see reforms carried out. He did, however, oppose the French dominance of the local government, and other policies, and for his critique he was eventually arrested by orders from Louis-Nicolas Davout and imprisoned in the fortress of Gifhorn. In the same year, he lost his first wife. In the summer of 1809 Louis was appointed sub-prefect of Salzwedel, where three years later in 1812 he married Karoline Heubel; they had three children. After Salzwedel was again under Prussian administration, in 1816 Ludwig von Westphalen was transferred to the newly established regional government in Trier.\n\nPersonal life\nIt was in Trier that he met and befriended Heinrich Marx, the father of Karl Marx. The children of the respective families, in particular Jenny and Edgar von Westphalen, and Sophie and Karl Marx, became close friends as well. In 1836, Jenny von Westphalen and Karl Marx became engaged; at first secretly but Ludwig approved the marriage in 1837, even though some saw Marx, who was both middle class and younger than her, as well as of Jewish descent, as an inappropriate partner for the noble daughter. In fact, Ludwig was seen as the mentor and role model of Karl Marx, who referred to him as a \"dear fatherly friend\". Ludwig filled Marx with enthusiasm for the romantic school and read him Homer and Shakespeare, who remained Marx's favorite authors all his life. Marx also read Voltaire and Racine with Ludwig. Ludwig devoted much of his time to the young Marx and the two went for intellectual walks through \"the hills and woods\" of the neighbourhood. It was Ludwig who first introduced Marx to the personality and socialist teachings of Saint-Simon. Marx dedicated his doctoral thesis \"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\" written in 1841 to Ludwig in a most effusive manner in which Marx wrote \"You, my fatherly friend, have always been for me the living proof that idealism is no illusion, but the true reality\" In 1842, Marx was present at the deathbed of Ludwig von Westphalen. Jenny and Karl became married in 1843, a year after Ludwig's death.\nHe was the father of Ferdinand von Westphalen, a conservative and reactionary Prussian Minister of the Interior.\n\nDeath\nHe died on 3 March 1842 in Trier.\nPassage 5:\nJames Armour (Master mason)\nJames Armour (15 January 1731 \u2013 20 September 1798) was a master mason and father of Jean Armour, and therefore the father-in-law of the poet Robert Burns. His birth year was shown here as 1730. The Scotland's People database has no record of this year of birth for a James Armour. Wikitree and several other data sources have his birth date as 10th/24th January 1731. The Scotland's People database has this record but showing his baptism on 24 January 1731. His birth on the original Old Parish Record is shown as 15 January 1731 to John Armour and Margrat(sic) Picken in Kilmarnock. James named his first son John which would normally be after James's father i.e. John. The chances of there being two James's born on exactly the same date exactly one year apart appear very remote and the naming of the first child seems to validate the conclusion that James Armour was born in 1731 and not 1730.\n\nLife and background\nAt Mauchline on 7 December 1761 he married Mary Smith, the daughter of stonemason Adam Smith. James died on 30 September 1798 and was buried in the family lair in Mauchline churchyard. His wife died in 1805 and was buried with her husband.\n\nFamily\nJames' eleven offspring with Mary, were, in birth order, John, Jean, James, Robert, Adam, Helen, Mary, Robert (2nd), Mary (2nd), Janet and Robert (3rd). Three siblings died in childhood. Dr John Armour was the eldest son who was born in Mauchline on 14 November 1762 and died in 1834. He had his practice in Kincardine-on-Forth where he died and was buried. He had two children, Janet and John, and married Janet Coventry on 10 March 1787. James and Mary's son James was born in Mauchline on 26 April 1767, married Betthaia Walker in 1794, Martha in 1818 and Janet in 1822. Their offspring were James and Betthaia. Adam Armour was named after Adam Smith, James Armour's father-in-law.The Armours' single-storey house stood in Cowgate, separated from John Dove's Whitefoord Arms by a narrow lane. Jean's bedroom window looked on to a window of the inn, thereby allowing Burns to converse with her from the public house itself. The Whitefoord Inn was often frequented by Burns and was also the meeting place of the so-called Court of Equity and linked to a significant incident in the life of Jean's brother Adam regarding the mistreatment of Agnes Wilson.\n\nOccupation and social standing\nJames was a master mason and contractor rather than an architect, regardless of Burns' attempts to describe him as one. He is known to have carried out contract work at Dumfries House near Cumnock and tradition links him to the building of Howford Bridge on the River Ayr, Greenan Bridge on the River Doon; Skeldon House, Dalrymple; and several other bridges in Ayrshire. Both the Armours and his wife's family had been stone-masons for several generations. William Burnes, Robert Burns' cousin, was apprenticed to James Armour.James was an adherent of the 'Auld Licht' style of religion and rented at 10/8 per year one of the most expensive pews in Mauchline church. James was rigid and austere, apparently living an exemplary life. Robert Burns-Begg, Burns' great-nephew, states that in contrast to her husband, Mary Armour was \"Partaken somewhat of the gay and frivolous.\".William 'Willie' Patrick, a source of many anecdotes about Robert and his family, stated about James that \"he was only a bit mason body, wha used to snuff a guid deal and gae afen tak a bit dram!\" He went on to say regarding James' attitude to Robert Burns that \"The thing was, he hated him, and would raither hae seen the Deil himsel comin to the hoose to coort his dochter than him! He cu'dna bear the sicht o'm, and that was the way he did it!\".\n\nAssociation with Robert Burns\nJames had disapproved of Burns's courtship of Jean, being aware of his affair with Elizabeth Paton, his 'New Licht' leanings and his poor financial situation. When informed in March 1786 by his distraught wife that Jean was pregnant he fainted and upon recovering consciousness and being given a strong cordial drink he enquired who the father was, fainting again when he was told that it was Robert Burns. The couple persuaded Jean to travel to Paisley and lodge with their relative Andrew Purdie, husband of her aunt Elizabeth Smith. Robert Wilson lived in Paisley, a possible suitor who had shown a romantic interest in Jean previously, appears to have been only part of the reason for this action, for on 8 April Mary Armour had vehemently denied to James Lamie, a member of the Kirk Session, that Jean was pregnant.\nRobert Burns produced a paper, probably a record of their \"Marriage by Declaration\" possibly witnessed by James Smith. This document, no longer extant, was defaced under James Armour's direction, probably by the lawyer Robert Aitken, with the names of both Robert and Jean being cut out. This act did not in fact effect its legality.  Robert wrote that James Armour's actions had \"...cut my very veins\", a feeling enhanced by Jean having handed over \"the unlucky paper\" and had agreed to go to Paisley.\nJames Armour in the meantime forced his daughter to sign a complaint and a warrant \"in meditatione fugae\" against Robert was issued to prevent his abandoning her. Burns fled to Old Rome Forest near Gatehead in South Ayrshire, where Jean Brown, Agnes Broun's half-sister and therefore an aunt of Burns, lived with her husband, James Allan.\nTwins were born to Jean and Robert on 3 September 1786, named after their parents as was the kirk's protocol for children born out of wedlock. Robert, notified of the birth by Adam Armour, that Sunday went to the Armour's house with a gift of tea, sugar and a Guinea that proved most acceptable.  Robert only returned from Edinburgh in the summer of 1787 to find that he was, thanks to his newly found fame as a published poet, actively welcomed into the family.\nJean however fell pregnant out of official wedlock once more, with the result that she felt forced to leave the Armour's home due to her father's anger. She was taken in by Willie Muir and his wife at Tarbolton Mill. It had previously been agreed that baby Jean would stay with her mother and baby Robert would join Bess at Mossgiel. The second set of twins did not live long and are buried, unnamed, in the Armour lair in Mauchline churchyard. Robert was in Edinburgh and did not arrive back until 23 February 1788; he then arranged accommodation for Jean.Whilst at the Brow Well Robert Burns wrote two of his last letters to his father-in-law asking that Mary Armour, who was away visiting relatives in Fife, be sent to Dumfries to help care for Jean who was heavily pregnant. On 10 July 1796 his last letter was signed \"Your most affectionate son. R. Burns.\"Upon the death of Robert Burnes his nephew Robert arranged for his cousin William to become a mason or building worker, working with James Armour, Burns' father-in-law.\n\nThe Inveraray marble Punch Bowl\nOf the many surviving Robert Burns artefacts few have such distinguished provenance as the punch bowl that was a nuptial gift in 1788 from James Armour to his daughter Jean and her new husband Robert Burns. As a stone-mason James had carved it himself (22cm x 14cm ) from dark green Inveraray marble and after residing at their various homes, Jean in 1801 presented it to her husband's great friend and Burns family benefactor Alexander Cunningham whilst she was on a visit to Edinburgh and staying with George Thomson. He had it mounted with a silver base and a rim, engraved upon which are the words \u201cYe whom social pleasure charms .. Come to my Bowl! Come to my arms, My FRIENDS, my BROTHERS!\u201d taken from Burns\u2019s \u201cThe Epistle to J. Lapraik.\u201dAlexander died in 1812 and it was then sold at auction in 1815 for the impressive price of 80 Guineas to a London publican who, falling upon hard times,  sold it to Archibald Hastie Esq of London. A copy is held by the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum at Alloway, whilst the original is in the British Museum in London, presented to that institution by Archibald Hastie in 1858.\n\nSee also\nAdam Armour\nJean Armour\nRobert Burnes\nWilliam Burnes\nPassage 6:\nPeter Burroughs\nPeter Burroughs (born 27 January 1947) is a British television and film actor and the director of Willow Management. He is the father-in-law of actor and TV presenter Warwick Davis.\n\nEarly career\nBurroughs initially ran a shop in his village at Yaxley, Cambridgeshire.\nHis first dramatic role was that of the character \"Branic\" in the 1979 television series The Legend of King Arthur. He also acted in the television shows Dick Turpin, The Goodies, Doctor Who in the serial The King's Demons and One Foot in the Grave.\n\nFilm career\nBurroughs played roles in Hollywood movies such as Flash Gordon, George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi (a swinging ewok), Willow, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In 1995, Burroughs set up Willow Management, an agency for short actors, along with co-actor Warwick Davis. He portrayed a bank goblin in the Harry Potter series (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2).\n\nPersonal life\nHis daughter Samantha (born 1971), is married to Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi and Willow film star Warwick Davis. He has another daughter, Hayley Burroughs, who is also an actress. His granddaughter is Annabelle Davis.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 7:\nHelmichis\nHelmichis (fl. 572) was a Lombard noble who killed his king, Alboin, in 572 and unsuccessfully attempted to usurp his throne. Alboin's queen, Rosamund, supported or at least did not oppose Helmichis' plan to remove the king, and after the assassination Helmichis married her. The assassination was assisted by Peredeo, the king's chamber-guard, who in some sources becomes the material executer of the murder. Helmichis is first mentioned by the contemporary chronicler Marius of Avenches, but the most detailed account of his endeavours derives from Paul the Deacon's  late 8th-century Historia Langobardorum.\nThe background to the assassination begins when Alboin killed the king of the Gepids in 567 and captured the king's daughter Rosamund. Alboin then led his people into Italy, and by 572 had settled himself in Verona, which made him vulnerable to the ambitions of other prominent Lombards, such as Helmichis, who was Alboin's foster-brother and arms-bearer.  After Alboin's death, Helmichis attempted to gain the throne. He married Rosamund to legitimize his position as new king, but immediately faced stiff opposition from his fellow Lombards who suspected Helmichis of conniving with the Byzantines; this hostility eventually focused around the duke of Ticinum Cleph, supporter of an aggressive policy towards the Empire.\nRather than going to war, Helmichis, Rosamund and their followers escaped to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis in order to be free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.\n\nBackground\nThe oldest author to write about Helmichis is the contemporary chronicler Marius of Avenches. In his account he mentions that \"Alboin was killed by his followers, that is Hilmaegis with the rest, his wife agreeing to it\". Marius continues by adding that, after killing the king, Helmichis married his widow and tried unsuccessfully to gain the throne. His attempt failed and he was forced to escape together with his wife, the royal treasure and the troops that had sided with him in the coup. This account has strong similarities with what is told in the Origo. The Origo would in its turn become a direct source for the Historia Langobardorum.The background to the assassination begins when Alboin, king of the Lombards, a Germanic people living in Pannonia (in the region of modern Hungary), went to war against the neighbouring Gepids in 567. In a decisive battle, Alboin killed the Gepid king Cunimund and captured the king's daughter Rosamund \u2013 later marrying her to guarantee the loyalty of the surviving Gepids. The following year, the Lombards migrated to Italy, a territory then held by the Byzantine Empire. In 569 Alboin took Mediolanum (Milan), the capital of northern Italy, and by 570 he had assumed control of most of northern Italy. The Byzantine forces entrenched themselves in the strategic town of Ticinum (Pavia), which they took only after a long siege. Even before taking Ticinum, the Lombards crossed the Apennines and invaded Tuscia. After the fall of Ticinum, Alboin chose Verona as his first permanent headquarters. In this town Alboin was assassinated in 572 and it is in these circumstances that Helmichis' name is first heard of. Most of the available details are in the Historia Langobardorum.\n\nAssassination\nBy settling himself in Verona and temporarily interrupting his chain of conquests, Alboin had weakened his popular standing as a charismatic warrior king. The first to take advantage of this was Rosamund, who could count on the support of the Gepid warriors in the town in her search for an opportunity to avenge the death of her father. To obtain this goal she persuaded Helmichis, spatharius (arms bearer) and foster brother of the king, and also head of a personal armed retinue in Verona, to take part in a plot to eliminate Alboin and replace him on the throne. Helmichis persuaded Rosamund to involve Peredeo, described by Paul simply as \"a very strong man\", who was seduced through a trick by the Queen and forced to consent to become the actual assassin.This story is partly in conflict with what is told by the Origo, which has Peredeo acting as an instigator and not as the murderer. In a similar vein to the Origo is the account of Peredeo contained in the Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani, where it is added that Peredeo was Alboin's \"chamber-guard\", hinting that in the original version of the story Peredeo's role may just have been to let in the real assassin, who is Helmichis in Agnellus' account, as it had been in that of Marius. However, the primary intent of the Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani may have been to obtain a more straightforward and coherent narrative by reducing the number of actors in the story, beginning with Peredeo. The disappearance of Peredeo, however, means that the role of Helmichis changes: while Paul presents him as \"the efficient conspirator and killer\", with Agnellus he is a victim of a ruthless and domineering queen.According to historian Paolo Delogu it may be that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard oral tradition than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.After the king's death on June 28, 572, Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona. The marriage was important for Helmichis: it legitimized his rule because, judging from Lombard history, royal prerogatives could be inherited by marrying the king's widow; and the marriage was a guarantee for Helmichis of the loyalty of the Gepids in the army, who sided with the queen since she was Cunimund's daughter.\n\nFailure\nBehind the coup were almost certainly the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if not from a pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or he may have been related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.Helmichis' coup ultimately failed because it met strong opposition from the many Lombards who wanted to continue the war against the Byzantines and to confront the regicides. Faced with the prospect of going to war at overwhelming odds, Helmichis asked for help from the Byzantines. The praetorian prefect Longinus enabled him to avoid a land route possibly held by hostile forces, by shipping him instead down the Po to Byzantine-held Ravenna, together with his wife, his Lombard and Gepid troops, the royal treasure and Albsuinda. Bognetti believes that Longinus may have planned to make the Lombards weaker by depriving them of any legitimate heir. In addition, because of the ongoing war, it was hard to assemble all the warriors to elect a new king formally. This plan was brought to nothing by the troops stationed in Ticinum, who elected their duke Cleph king, having it in mind to continue Alboin's aggressive policy. In contrast, Wolfram argues that Cleph was elected in Ticinum while Helmichis was still making his bid for the crown in Verona.\n\nDeath\nOnce in Ravenna, Helmichis and Rosamund rapidly became estranged. According to Paul, Longinus persuaded Rosamund to get rid of her husband so that he could marry her. To accomplish this, she made him drink a cup full of poison; before dying, however, Helmichis understood what his wife had done and forced her to drink the cup too, so they both died. According to Wolfram, there may be some historical truth in the account of Longinus' proposal to Rosamund, as it was possible to achieve Lombard kingship by marrying the queen, but the story of the two lovers' end is not historical but legendary. The mutual murder as told by Agnellus is given a different interpretation by Joaquin Martinez Pizarro: he sees Helmichis' last action as a symbol of how the natural hierarchy of sexes is at last restored, after the queen's actions had unnaturally modified the proper equilibrium.At this point, Longinus sent the royal treasure and Albsuinda to Constantinople, the Empire's capital, together with Helmichis' forces, which were to become Byzantine mercenaries. This was a common Byzantine strategy, already applied previously to the Ostrogoths, by which large national contingents were relocated to be used in other theatres. These are believed to be the same 60,000 Lombards that are attested by John of Ephesus as being active in Syria in 575 against the Persians. As for Albsuinda, the Byzantine diplomacy probably aimed to use her as a political tool to impose a pro-Byzantine king on the Lombards. According to Agnellus, once Longinus' actions came to the attention of emperor Justin II they were greatly praised, and the emperor gave lavish gifts to his official.Cleph kept his throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed him, opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only when faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.\n\nEarly Middle Ages sources\nAmong the surviving Early Middle Ages sources, there are six that mention Helmichis by name. Of these, the only contemporary one is the Chronica of Marius of Avenches, written in the 580s. Marius was bishop of Aventicum, a town located in the western Alps in the Frankish Kingdom of Burgundy. Because of the small distance from Aventicum to the Italian peninsula, the chronicler had easy access to information regarding northern Italy. For this reason, historian Roger Collins considers the Chronica, though short, to be reliable on Italian matters. The remaining sources all come from Italy and were written in later centuries. Two of them were written in the 7th century, the Continuatio Havniensis Prosperi and the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, both anonymous. The Continuatio is a chronicle written around 625 that has reached us in a single manuscript. As its name suggests, it is a continuation of the 5th century chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine. Derived in considerable measure from the Chronica Majora of Isidore of Seville, it blames the Romans for their inability to defend Italy from foreign invaders, and praises the Lombards for defending the country from the Franks. This is the earliest surviving work to name Rosamund, the queen of the Lombards who plays a central role in Helmichis' attested biography. The other 7th century work, the Origo, is a brief prose history of the Lombards that is essentially an annotated king list, although it begins with a description of the founding myth of the Lombard nation. Giorgio Ausenda believes that the Origo was written around 643 as a prologue to the Edictum Rothari, and continued to be updated till 671. According to Walter Pohl, the author's motives are mostly political: the Origo serves to consolidate the Lombards' national identity by emphasising a shared history. Apart from the origin myth, the only more detailed account is the one concerning the death of Alboin, and thus Helmichis.For the events surrounding 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, a history of the Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished in the last two decades of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nJohn Adams (merchant)\nJohn Adams (1672 or 1673 \u2013 c. 1745) was an American-born Canadian merchant and member of the Nova Scotia Council. He was the father-in-law of Henry Newton.\n\nBiography\nAdams was born in Boston in either 1672 or 1673 to John and Avis Adams. Growing up as a petty merchant, Adams joined Sir Charles Hobby's New England regiment, participating in the capture of Port-Royal in 1710. Shortly thereafter, Adams settled in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, returning to civilian life. There, he traded manufactured goods with the province's Acadian and Native Americans, and took up the role of a real estate agent and contractor. Adams joined the Executive Council of Nova Scotia on 28 April 1720, holding his position there for 20 years; the records show that few served as long as he did. He also held several other public positions in the province. Adams was appointed a notary public and deputy collector of customs for Annapolis Royal in 1725, and he was commissioned a justice of the peace in March 1727.Around the mid-1720s, Adams' poor eyesight began to fail, leading to his near-blindness in 1730. After this, he was less active in community activities and trade. Adams petitioned to the king for a pension several times, but failed. He blamed his disability on over-exposure to the sun during an Indian attack on Annapolis Royal in 1724. In December 1739, Lieutenant Governor Lawrence Armstrong died. With the absence of Major Mascarene to take Armstrong's place, Adams became the new president of the council and head of the civil government. (Alexander Cosby was also vying for the position.) In a meeting on 22 March 1740, with the return of Mascarene, the councilors declared that he was the council's rightful president. This turn of events led Adams to retire to Boston in late August or early September 1740, where he stayed for the rest of his life. He died some time after 1745.\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nOgawa Mataji\nViscount Ogawa Mataji (\u5c0f\u5ddd\u53c8\u6b21, 22 August 1848 \u2013 20 October 1909) was a general in the early Imperial Japanese Army.

In March 1882, he was chief of staff of the Hiroshima Garrison. Promoted to colonel in October 1884, he was assigned the IJA 8th Infantry Regiment. In May 1885, he joined the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. German General Jakob Meckel, hired by the Japanese government as a foreign advisor and instructor in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy highly praised Ogawa and fellow colonel Kodama Gentar\u014d as the two most outstanding officers in the Imperial Japanese Army. Ogawa was especially noted for his abilities as a military strategist and planner, and earned the sobriquet \u201cthe modern Kenshin\") from General Kawakami Soroku.\n\nFirst Sino-Japanese War\nOgawa was promoted to major general in June 1890, and given command of the IJA 4th Infantry Brigade, followed by command of the 1st Guards Brigade. At the start of the First Sino-Japanese War in August 1894, he was chief of staff of the Japanese First Army. In August 1895, he was elevated to the kazoku peerage with the title of danshaku (baron). He commanded the 2nd Guards Brigade from January 1896 and was subsequently promoted to lieutenant general in April 1897, assuming command of the IJA 4th Infantry Division. In May 1903, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasures, first class.\n\nRusso-Japanese War\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, Ogawa retained command of the IJA 4th Division under the Japanese Second Army of General Oku Yasukata.  The division was in combat at the Battle of Nanshan, Battle of Telissu and Battle of Liaoyang. At the Battle of Liaoyang, Ogawa was injured in combat, and forced to relinquish his command and return to Tokyo. In January 1905, he was promoted to general, but took a medical leave from December 1905. He was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite, 2nd class in 1906.  In September 1907 he was elevated to viscount (shishaku) He officially retired in November.\nOgawa died on 20 October 1909 due to peritonitis after being hospitalized for dysentery.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nDonnie Elbert\nDonnie Elbert (May 25, 1936 \u2013 January 26, 1989) was an American soul singer and songwriter, who had a prolific career from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s. His U.S. hits included \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" (1971), and his reputation as a Northern soul artist in the UK was secured by \"A Little Piece of Leather\", a performance highlighting his powerful falsetto voice.\n\nCareer\nElbert was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but when aged three his family relocated to Buffalo, New York. He learned to play guitar and piano as a child, and in 1955 formed a doo-wop group, the Vibraharps, with friend Danny Cannon. Elbert acted as the group's guitarist, songwriter, arranger, and background vocalist, making his recording debut on their single \"Walk Beside Me\". He left the group in 1957 for a solo career, and recorded a demonstration record that earned him a recording contract with the King label's DeLuxe subsidiary. His solo debut \"What Can I Do?\" reached #12 in the U.S. R&B chart, and he followed it up with the less successful \"Believe It or Not\" and \"Have I Sinned?\", which became a regional hit in Pittsburgh.He continued to release singles on DeLuxe, but with little commercial success, and also played New York's Apollo Theater and toured the Chitlin' Circuit of African-American owned nightclubs. After completing an album, The Sensational Donnie Elbert Sings, he left DeLuxe in 1959, joining first Red Top Records, where in 1960 he recorded \"Someday (You'll Want Me to Want You)\", and then Vee-Jay Records, where he had another regional hit with \"Will You Ever Be Mine?\", which reportedly sold 250,000 copies in the Philadelphia area but failed to take off nationwide. His career was also interrupted by a spell in the US Army, from which he was discharged in 1961. He then recorded singles for several labels, including Parkway, Cub and Checker, but with little success. However, although the 1965 Gateway label release of \"A Little Piece of Leather\" failed to chart in the US, the record became a #27 pop hit when released on the London label in the UK several years later in 1972, and remains a Northern soul favorite.Elbert relocated to the UK in 1966, where he married. There, he recorded \"In Between The Heartaches\" for the Polydor label in 1968, a cover version of the Supremes' hit \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" and an album of Otis Redding cover versions, Tribute To A King. His 1969 Deram release \"Without You\" had a rocksteady rhythm, and went to the top of the Jamaican charts.\nHe returned to the US the same year and had his first US chart hit in over a decade with the Rare Bullet release, \"Can't Get Over Losing You\", which reached #26 on the Billboard R&B chart. The track and its b-side, \"Got To Get Myself Together\", both written by Elbert, were released several times on different labels in subsequent years. After the success of that record, Elbert moved labels for a re-make of the Supremes' 1964 hit, \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" on All Platinum. It became his biggest hit, reaching #15 on the Billboard pop chart, #6 on the R&B chart, and (in 1972) #8 in the UK. Its follow-up, \"Sweet Baby\" reached #30 on the R&B chart in early 1972.\nElbert then signed with Avco-Embassy, where he entered the recording studio with the successful production team of Hugo & Luigi. His cover of the Four Tops' \"I Can't Help Myself\" reached #14 on the Billboard R&B chart, but climbed as high as #2 on the alternative Cashbox R&B chart. Elbert baulked at the label's insistence that he record material associated with Motown and departed with only a few tracks left to record for an album. Even so, the album was released after Avco sold it on to a budget label, Trip.\nHe returned to All Platinum and had a run of minor R&B hits, but left after a disagreement over the claimed authorship of Shirley & Company's R&B chart-topper \"Shame Shame Shame\", which was credited to label owner Sylvia Robinson. Elbert was also involved in a copyright wrangle over Darrell Banks' major R&B and pop hit in 1966, \"Open The Door To Your Heart\". He had originally written the song as \"Baby Walk Right In\" (still its alternative legal title) and given it to Banks, but received no writing credit on the original record. Eventually, the matter was resolved by BMI with a disgruntled Elbert awarded joint authorship with Banks. \"Open The Door\" has since been given award-winning status by BMI and is one of over 100 songs written or co-written by Elbert.\nFor 1975's \"You Keep Me Crying (With Your Lying)\", Elbert formed his own label and \"I Got to Get Myself Together\", appeared on an imprint bearing his surname, but it was among his final recordings.By the mid-1980s, Elbert had retired from performing and became director of A&R for Polygram's Canadian division. He suffered a massive stroke and died in 1989, at the age of 52.\n\nDiscography\nChart singles\nAlbums\nThe Sensational Donnie Elbert Sings (King, 1959)\nTribute to a King (1968)\nWhere Did Our Love Go?

Noting her singing talents, her parents brought their young child to auditions for musical theater productions in New York City. The singer joined Glee clubs at school and formed her own female singing groups at school. At the age of 11, she heard her first \"Rock and Roll\" song. This affected her taste in music and desire to emulate the style; it was the first time she heard a Rock group with a female lead singer. This was significant since she realized that she could be a lead singer.\n\nRecording career\nAt the age of 15, her parents sent her for vocal coaching in Manhattan, N.Y. After a while her coach sent her to record a demonstration record in a sound studio near Broadway. Upon hearing her sing, the sound engineer contacted his friend who was a producer of a small record company in N.Y.C.; he was impressed by her voice and immediately signed her to a contract. The singer's mother co-signed the document since Baron was a fifteen-year-old minor at the time.Baron became one of the many girl group/girl sound singers of the early 1960s. Baron was not a member of a group; her producers would hire \"pay for hire\" backup groups for her recordings. This \"sound\" as it is referred to had much to do with Phil Spector, one of its major creators; Spector produced recordings of this genre prolifically. The groups were composed of young adult or teenage girls, each with a lead singer and any number of back up singers.At the time, the troubled label (a small N.Y.C. record company owned by Wally Zober) could not promote Baron's \"I've Got A Feeling\"/\"Oh Yeah\" 45 vinyl and so she eventually signed a contract with Jerry Goldstein producer of FGG productions, also located in Manhattan. \"Where Did My Jimmy Go\"/\"Tra la la, I Love You\" was the result (Diamond).\n\nLater life\nBaron left the music industry at the age of 19, choosing to enter higher education due to changes in the music industry of those days; she eventually received an advanced degree.\nBaron's \"I've Got a Feeling\" was covered by The Secret Sisters on their 2010 self-titled album as well as being released as a single. AllMusic describes Baron's song as \"an early-'60s pop/rock obscurity\".\nPassage 4:\nJack Carroll (hurler)\nJack Carroll (1921\u20131998) is an Irish hurler who played as a goalkeeper for the Offaly senior hurling team.\nCarroll made his first appearance for the team during the 1943 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1953 championship. During that time he enjoyed little success as Offaly were regarded as one of the minnows of provincial hurling.\nAt club level Carroll was a five-time county club championship medalist with Coolderry.\nCarroll's father-in-law, \"Red\" Jack Teehan, his son, Pat Carroll, and his grandson, Brian Carroll, also played hurling with Offaly.\nPassage 5:\nAndrew Allen (singer)\nAndrew Allen (born 6 May 1981) is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Vernon, British Columbia. He is signed to Sony/ATV and has released five top ten singles, and written and recorded many others, including Where Did We Go? with Carly Rae Jepsen.

He was honored as the feature performer for the Sochi 2014 hand off finale on the internationally broadcast Closing Ceremony of the 2010 Paralympic Winter Games held at Whistler, British Columbia. Allen continued building an international profile in 2010, and released his biggest single Loving You Tonight, which sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide, was featured on the Gold Selling NOW 37, hit #6 on the Canadian charts for 22 weeks in a row and #30 on the US Hot AC charts, and got him a record deal with Epic after spending much of that year on the road. Because of the song's attention, Allen had the opportunity to perform with some of the world's biggest artists like Bruno Mars, One Republic, The Barenaked Ladies, Train, Matt Nathanson, Joshua Radin, Andy Grammer, The Script, Nick Carter, Kris Allen, Carly Rae Jepsen and many others.\nLoving You Tonight was also featured on the soundtrack of Abduction starring Taylor Lautner.\n\nCollaborations\nAndrew Allen is also well known in the songwriting community, and has written songs with artists like Meghan Trainor, Rachel Platten, Cody Simpson, Carly Rae Jepsen, Matt Simons, Conrad Sewell as well as writer/producers like Toby Gad, Ryan Stewart, Eric Rosse, Jason Reeves, John Shanks, Nolan Sipes, Mark Pellizzer (Magic), Brian West and Josh Cumbee.

Her elder sisters were Theresa Elizabeth Perez (1924\u20132001), a classically trained musician and the producer/founder of the People's Pops Concerts in Phoenix, Arizona, and journalist Kathleen Moira Carroll (1927\u20132007).Carroll attended Clerkhill Notre Dame High School, a Roman Catholic convent school in Dumbarton.\n\nStage career\nCarroll received her acting training at the Central School which later became the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art London, appearing in three plays in London's West End and a film, Midnight Episode, by age 20. She made her Broadway debut in Separate Tables by Terence Rattigan. She moved to the U.S. during the 1950s, touring and performing on Broadway and co-founded, with Dermot McNamara, The Irish Players, a repertory theater company in Manhattan.Helena split her stage work between Dublin, London and New York, appearing on Broadway in, among other productions the original production of Oliver! as Mrs. Sowerberry, as well as Pickwick, Design for Living, Waiting in the Wings, and the Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton revival of Private Lives (New York and Los Angeles). Her last stage performance was in 2007 at the age of 78.\n\nFilm and television\nCarroll played the leading role of Nora, in a television production of her father's play, The White Steed (1959 Play of the Week Series), directed by Joe Gisterak. Gisterak directed a 1980 commissioned opera of her father's play, Beauty is Fled, as part of the \"Children's Opera Series\", which her sister,  Theresa Perez founded. The opera was performed at the Phoenix Symphony Hall.\nPrompted by producer Al Simon and casting director Caro Jones, Carroll moved to Los Angeles in the late 1960s and appeared in numerous films and television programs, including the lively Aunt Kate in John Huston's Academy Award-nominated film The Dead, based on the short story by James Joyce.

Out. What Did You Do? Nothing.\n\nBiography\nRobert Paul Smith was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Mount Vernon, NY, and graduated from Columbia College in 1936. He worked as a writer for CBS Radio and wrote four novels: So It Doesn't Whistle (1946) (1941, according to Avon Publishing Co., Inc., reprint edition ... Plus Blood in Their Veins copyright 1952); The Journey, (1943); Because of My Love (1946); The Time and the Place (1951).\nThe Tender Trap, a play by Smith and Dobie Gillis creator Max Shulman, opened in 1954 with Robert Preston in the leading role. It was later made into a movie starring Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds. A classic example of the \"battle-of-the-sexes\" comedy, it revolves around the mutual envy of a bachelor living in New York City and a settled family man living in the New York suburbs.\nWhere Did You Go? Out. What Did You Do? Nothing is a nostalgic evocation of the inner life of childhood. It advocates the value of privacy to children; the importance of unstructured time; the joys of boredom; and the virtues of freedom from adult supervision. He opens by saying \"The thing is, I don't understand what kids do with themselves any more.\" He contrasts the overstructured, overscheduled, oversupervised suburban life of the child in the suburban 1950's with reminiscences of his own childhood. He concludes \"I guess what I am saying is that people who don't have nightmares don't have dreams. If you will excuse me, I have an appointment with myself to sit on the front steps and watch some grass growing.\"\nTranslations from the English (1958) collects a series of articles originally published in Good Housekeeping magazine.

His U.S. hits included \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" (1971), and his reputation as a Northern soul artist in the UK was secured by \"A Little Piece of Leather\", a performance highlighting his powerful falsetto voice.\n\nCareer\nElbert was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but when aged three his family relocated to Buffalo, New York. He learned to play guitar and piano as a child, and in 1955 formed a doo-wop group, the Vibraharps, with friend Danny Cannon. Elbert acted as the group's guitarist, songwriter, arranger, and background vocalist, making his recording debut on their single \"Walk Beside Me\". He left the group in 1957 for a solo career, and recorded a demonstration record that earned him a recording contract with the King label's DeLuxe subsidiary. His solo debut \"What Can I Do?\" reached #12 in the U.S. R&B chart, and he followed it up with the less successful \"Believe It or Not\" and \"Have I Sinned?\", which became a regional hit in Pittsburgh.He continued to release singles on DeLuxe, but with little commercial success, and also played New York's Apollo Theater and toured the Chitlin' Circuit of African-American owned nightclubs. After completing an album, The Sensational Donnie Elbert Sings, he left DeLuxe in 1959, joining first Red Top Records, where in 1960 he recorded \"Someday (You'll Want Me to Want You)\", and then Vee-Jay Records, where he had another regional hit with \"Will You Ever Be Mine?\", which reportedly sold 250,000 copies in the Philadelphia area but failed to take off nationwide. His career was also interrupted by a spell in the US Army, from which he was discharged in 1961. He then recorded singles for several labels, including Parkway, Cub and Checker, but with little success. However, although the 1965 Gateway label release of \"A Little Piece of Leather\" failed to chart in the US, the record became a #27 pop hit when released on the London label in the UK several years later in 1972, and remains a Northern soul favorite.Elbert relocated to the UK in 1966, where he married. There, he recorded \"In Between The Heartaches\" for the Polydor label in 1968, a cover version of the Supremes' hit \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" and an album of Otis Redding cover versions, Tribute To A King. His 1969 Deram release \"Without You\" had a rocksteady rhythm, and went to the top of the Jamaican charts.\nHe returned to the US the same year and had his first US chart hit in over a decade with the Rare Bullet release, \"Can't Get Over Losing You\", which reached #26 on the Billboard R&B chart. The track and its b-side, \"Got To Get Myself Together\", both written by Elbert, were released several times on different labels in subsequent years. After the success of that record, Elbert moved labels for a re-make of the Supremes' 1964 hit, \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" on All Platinum. It became his biggest hit, reaching #15 on the Billboard pop chart, #6 on the R&B chart, and (in 1972) #8 in the UK. Its follow-up, \"Sweet Baby\" reached #30 on the R&B chart in early 1972.\nElbert then signed with Avco-Embassy, where he entered the recording studio with the successful production team of Hugo & Luigi. His cover of the Four Tops' \"I Can't Help Myself\" reached #14 on the Billboard R&B chart, but climbed as high as #2 on the alternative Cashbox R&B chart. Elbert baulked at the label's insistence that he record material associated with Motown and departed with only a few tracks left to record for an album. Even so, the album was released after Avco sold it on to a budget label, Trip.\nHe returned to All Platinum and had a run of minor R&B hits, but left after a disagreement over the claimed authorship of Shirley & Company's R&B chart-topper \"Shame Shame Shame\", which was credited to label owner Sylvia Robinson. Elbert was also involved in a copyright wrangle over Darrell Banks' major R&B and pop hit in 1966, \"Open The Door To Your Heart\". He had originally written the song as \"Baby Walk Right In\" (still its alternative legal title) and given it to Banks, but received no writing credit on the original record. Eventually, the matter was resolved by BMI with a disgruntled Elbert awarded joint authorship with Banks. \"Open The Door\" has since been given award-winning status by BMI and is one of over 100 songs written or co-written by Elbert.\nFor 1975's \"You Keep Me Crying (With Your Lying)\", Elbert formed his own label and \"I Got to Get Myself Together\", appeared on an imprint bearing his surname, but it was among his final recordings.By the mid-1980s, Elbert had retired from performing and became director of A&R for Polygram's Canadian division. He suffered a massive stroke and died in 1989, at the age of 52.\n\nDiscography\nChart singles\nAlbums\nThe Sensational Donnie Elbert Sings (King, 1959)\nTribute to a King (1968)\nWhere Did Our Love Go?

Noting her singing talents, her parents brought their young child to auditions for musical theater productions in New York City. The singer joined Glee clubs at school and formed her own female singing groups at school. At the age of 11, she heard her first \"Rock and Roll\" song. This affected her taste in music and desire to emulate the style; it was the first time she heard a Rock group with a female lead singer. This was significant since she realized that she could be a lead singer.\n\nRecording career\nAt the age of 15, her parents sent her for vocal coaching in Manhattan, N.Y. After a while her coach sent her to record a demonstration record in a sound studio near Broadway. Upon hearing her sing, the sound engineer contacted his friend who was a producer of a small record company in N.Y.C.; he was impressed by her voice and immediately signed her to a contract. The singer's mother co-signed the document since Baron was a fifteen-year-old minor at the time.Baron became one of the many girl group/girl sound singers of the early 1960s. Baron was not a member of a group; her producers would hire \"pay for hire\" backup groups for her recordings. This \"sound\" as it is referred to had much to do with Phil Spector, one of its major creators; Spector produced recordings of this genre prolifically. The groups were composed of young adult or teenage girls, each with a lead singer and any number of back up singers.At the time, the troubled label (a small N.Y.C. record company owned by Wally Zober) could not promote Baron's \"I've Got A Feeling\"/\"Oh Yeah\" 45 vinyl and so she eventually signed a contract with Jerry Goldstein producer of FGG productions, also located in Manhattan. \"Where Did My Jimmy Go\"/\"Tra la la, I Love You\" was the result (Diamond).\n\nLater life\nBaron left the music industry at the age of 19, choosing to enter higher education due to changes in the music industry of those days; she eventually received an advanced degree.\nBaron's \"I've Got a Feeling\" was covered by The Secret Sisters on their 2010 self-titled album as well as being released as a single. AllMusic describes Baron's song as \"an early-'60s pop/rock obscurity\".\nPassage 4:\nJack Carroll (hurler)\nJack Carroll (1921\u20131998) is an Irish hurler who played as a goalkeeper for the Offaly senior hurling team.\nCarroll made his first appearance for the team during the 1943 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1953 championship. During that time he enjoyed little success as Offaly were regarded as one of the minnows of provincial hurling.\nAt club level Carroll was a five-time county club championship medalist with Coolderry.\nCarroll's father-in-law, \"Red\" Jack Teehan, his son, Pat Carroll, and his grandson, Brian Carroll, also played hurling with Offaly.\nPassage 5:\nAndrew Allen (singer)\nAndrew Allen (born 6 May 1981) is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Vernon, British Columbia.

Allen continued building an international profile in 2010, and released his biggest single Loving You Tonight, which sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide, was featured on the Gold Selling NOW 37, hit #6 on the Canadian charts for 22 weeks in a row and #30 on the US Hot AC charts, and got him a record deal with Epic after spending much of that year on the road. Because of the song's attention, Allen had the opportunity to perform with some of the world's biggest artists like Bruno Mars, One Republic, The Barenaked Ladies, Train, Matt Nathanson, Joshua Radin, Andy Grammer, The Script, Nick Carter, Kris Allen, Carly Rae Jepsen and many others.\nLoving You Tonight was also featured on the soundtrack of Abduction starring Taylor Lautner.\n\nCollaborations\nAndrew Allen is also well known in the songwriting community, and has written songs with artists like Meghan Trainor, Rachel Platten, Cody Simpson, Carly Rae Jepsen, Matt Simons, Conrad Sewell as well as writer/producers like Toby Gad, Ryan Stewart, Eric Rosse, Jason Reeves, John Shanks, Nolan Sipes, Mark Pellizzer (Magic), Brian West and Josh Cumbee.

He became a figurehead in this team, as he scored many goals and charmed the supporters with his numerous dribbles. He scored 32 goals in 72 games and helped the club win the Thai Premier League Championship Thai Division 1 League in 2008 and the Thai Premier League in 2009.\n\nGent\nOn 1 July 2010, Soumahoro joined Belgian club K.A.A.

It was announced he would be out of action for four weeks. In October 2010, he signed a one-year contract extension, tying him to the club until 2014.In April 2011, he received a three-match suspension.In March 2012, it was announced Soumahoro would need to undergo surgery likely ruling him out for the rest of the 2012\u201313 season.In October 2013, he signed a two-year contract extension with Gent, keeping him at the club until 2016.On 20 September 2015, Soumahoro made his first starting appearance after an injury layoff in a league match against Standard Li\u00e8ge.

It has Barabbas as the subject, who was pardoned according to the Biblical report in place of Jesus Christ by Pontius Pilate.\nThe film is based on the novel Wine of Morning by Bob Jones Jr.\n\nPlot\nOn a stormy voyage Barabbas writes a letter to his friend Stephen and remembers his time in Galilean Nazareth.\nThere he is friends with the carpenter Josef and his son Jesus . One day he meets Irene, the future bride of his friend Stephanus, and falls in love with her. On Stephanus' and Irene's wedding in Cana, the wine goes out surprisingly. Mary asks Jesus for help, who then turns water into wine.\nA little later, Joel decides to leave Nazareth and go to Capernaum. There he visits his friends Sarah and Jonathan and their son Dismas. Jonathan has been paralyzed, so Joel and Dismas supports Jonathan's business. He meets the rabid tax collector Levi and notes bitterly the oppression of the Jews by the Romans. While Joel would like to fight, Jonathan is waiting for salvation from God.\nAfter Dismas one day watched with enthusiasm a demon exorcism by Jesus, he and Joel also bring Jonathan to Jesus. They let Jonathan down through the ceiling of the house to Jesus; Jonathan is healed.\nIn the meantime, Joel meets the stranger Omah, whose family was cruelly killed by the Romans. Omah takes Joel to Jesus; but to Joel's disappointment, Jesus does not choose him as a disciple. Omah recruits Joel for an underground movement fighting for the liberation of Israel.\nIn Jerusalem, Joel meets Prince Manean and is educated by him for six months. While performing a mission, he saves the Egyptian dancer Myra from the advances of Manean's servant Toron. Joel and Myra fall in love.\nManean plans an action against the Romans for the approaching Passover celebration . He gives Joel the name Barabbas, as he proposes to rob the necessary money from the expected pilgrims. A little later, Dismas also joins the group around Manean.\nWhen Toron betrays Barabbas to the Romans, Barabbas escapes and kills Toron. Myra suggests Manean use Toron's funeral to escape together.

Pilate can not blame him, but the people demand Jesus' crucifixion. Pilate leaves the people the choice of whether to pardon Jesus or Barabbas on the occasion of the Passover feast; the people choose Barabbas. Finally, Pilate gives in to the people and condemns Jesus; Barabbas' accomplices Gestas and Dismas are crucified together with Jesus. Shaken, Barabbas follows Jesus' crucifixion on Golgotha . Jesus is mocked by those present; only Dismas holds to him.\nAfter Barabbas' ship is shipwrecked during the storm, Barabbas is taken to Irene, who now has a son named Joel. Irene tells Barabbas of Jesus' resurrection and ascension. She and Stephen were later baptized; Stephen was stoned by the Romans for his faith. Shortly before leaving, Barabbas Irene admits that he once loved her.\nIn Antioch, Barabbas meets Manean, who has converted to Christianity; Barabbas also becomes a Christian.

Six months later, the novel was completed. The novel was finally filmed by Unusual Films; Bob Jones Jr. took over the role of Pontius Pilatus.\nWine of Morning was featured at the International Congress of Motion's Picture and Television School Directors at the Cannes International Film Festival.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nMichael Govan\nMichael Govan (born 1963) is the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million\u2014about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States.

As a high school student during the Depression, she supplemented her family's income by writing movie reviews for a local newspaper.  Rejecting a college scholarship to Wellesley, Corne attended the fledgling Bob Jones College in Cleveland, Tennessee, after an evangelist convinced her that a Christian young person should attend a Christian college.  At BJC, she majored in speech and became a private student of Bob Jones Jr., eventually helping him direct Shakespearean plays.  After earning her undergraduate degree, she served on the BJC speech faculty while attending graduate school at Northwestern University for twelve summers. During this period she married Gilbert R. Stenholm (1915\u201389), who became an influential administrator at the institution; they had one son.In 1950, after the college moved to Greenville and became Bob Jones University, Bob Jones Sr. and Jr. asked Stenholm to head a newly conceived campus film production company, Unusual Films.  Stenholm then attended summer film school at the University of Southern California, making important professional contacts and serving an internship with Stanley Kramer.   Stenholm was a quick learner and soon \"became one of only a handful of women in the United States to direct feature films.\"  Through her career she produced seventy-two films of various types including sermon films, religious documentaries, promotional films, and multi-image presentations.  She directed five feature-length religious films, all costume dramas: \n\nWine of Morning\nRed Runs the River\nFlame in the Wind\nSheffey\nBeyond the Night.The National Evangelical Film Foundation named Stenholm Director of the Year in 1953, 1955, and 1963; and her favorite film, Sheffey, received a Silver Medallion award from the International Film and Television Festival of New York.In 1958, at the height of the Cold War, the University Film Producers Association selected Wine of Morning as its submission to the International Congress of Motion Picture and Television School Directors at the Cannes Film Festival, and Stenholm was the keynote speaker on the occasion. A U.S. State Department official who briefed Stenholm told her there had been a round of applause when the Department discovered that BJU had been chosen to represent the United States because \"Bob Jones University is one school about which there is no worry!\" The selection committee thought Wine of Morning would demonstrate the excellence of American cinema training and the film's frank religious message would \"provide a revealing contrast to the entries from Russia and the other Communist-dominated countries.\"In 1986, Stenholm suffered a stroke in the Soviet Union while taking scenic footage in preparation for another feature-length film.  She retired as director of Unusual Films but continued to teach at BJU until 2001. Stenholm died in November 2015 at the age of 98.\nPassage 8:\nJesse E.

It has Barabbas as the subject, who was pardoned according to the Biblical report in place of Jesus Christ by Pontius Pilate.\nThe film is based on the novel Wine of Morning by Bob Jones Jr.\n\nPlot\nOn a stormy voyage Barabbas writes a letter to his friend Stephen and remembers his time in Galilean Nazareth.\nThere he is friends with the carpenter Josef and his son Jesus . One day he meets Irene, the future bride of his friend Stephanus, and falls in love with her. On Stephanus' and Irene's wedding in Cana, the wine goes out surprisingly. Mary asks Jesus for help, who then turns water into wine.\nA little later, Joel decides to leave Nazareth and go to Capernaum. There he visits his friends Sarah and Jonathan and their son Dismas. Jonathan has been paralyzed, so Joel and Dismas supports Jonathan's business. He meets the rabid tax collector Levi and notes bitterly the oppression of the Jews by the Romans. While Joel would like to fight, Jonathan is waiting for salvation from God.\nAfter Dismas one day watched with enthusiasm a demon exorcism by Jesus, he and Joel also bring Jonathan to Jesus. They let Jonathan down through the ceiling of the house to Jesus; Jonathan is healed.\nIn the meantime, Joel meets the stranger Omah, whose family was cruelly killed by the Romans. Omah takes Joel to Jesus; but to Joel's disappointment, Jesus does not choose him as a disciple. Omah recruits Joel for an underground movement fighting for the liberation of Israel.\nIn Jerusalem, Joel meets Prince Manean and is educated by him for six months. While performing a mission, he saves the Egyptian dancer Myra from the advances of Manean's servant Toron. Joel and Myra fall in love.\nManean plans an action against the Romans for the approaching Passover celebration . He gives Joel the name Barabbas, as he proposes to rob the necessary money from the expected pilgrims. A little later, Dismas also joins the group around Manean.\nWhen Toron betrays Barabbas to the Romans, Barabbas escapes and kills Toron. Myra suggests Manean use Toron's funeral to escape together. Soon Barabbas is wanted by the Romans as a robber. A little later, Barabbas is caught in a robbery; Myra is coming.\nAt the same time, Pontius Pilate is presented Jesus as a prisoner accused of blasphemy. Pilate can not blame him, but the people demand Jesus' crucifixion. Pilate leaves the people the choice of whether to pardon Jesus or Barabbas on the occasion of the Passover feast; the people choose Barabbas. Finally, Pilate gives in to the people and condemns Jesus; Barabbas' accomplices Gestas and Dismas are crucified together with Jesus. Shaken, Barabbas follows Jesus' crucifixion on Golgotha . Jesus is mocked by those present; only Dismas holds to him.\nAfter Barabbas' ship is shipwrecked during the storm, Barabbas is taken to Irene, who now has a son named Joel.

Six months later, the novel was completed. The novel was finally filmed by Unusual Films; Bob Jones Jr. took over the role of Pontius Pilatus.\nWine of Morning was featured at the International Congress of Motion's Picture and Television School Directors at the Cannes International Film Festival.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nMichael Govan\nMichael Govan (born 1963) is the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million\u2014about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States. He has had a private pilot's license since 1995 and keeps a 1979 Beechcraft Bonanza at Santa Monica Airport.\nPassage 7:\nKatherine Stenholm\nKatherine Corne Stenholm (June 19, 1917 \u2013 November 3, 2015) was an American film director and the founding director of Unusual Films, the production company of Bob Jones University.\n\nBiography\nKatherine Corne was born and reared in Hendersonville, North Carolina.  As a high school student during the Depression, she supplemented her family's income by writing movie reviews for a local newspaper.  Rejecting a college scholarship to Wellesley, Corne attended the fledgling Bob Jones College in Cleveland, Tennessee, after an evangelist convinced her that a Christian young person should attend a Christian college.  At BJC, she majored in speech and became a private student of Bob Jones Jr., eventually helping him direct Shakespearean plays.  After earning her undergraduate degree, she served on the BJC speech faculty while attending graduate school at Northwestern University for twelve summers. During this period she married Gilbert R. Stenholm (1915\u201389), who became an influential administrator at the institution; they had one son.In 1950, after the college moved to Greenville and became Bob Jones University, Bob Jones Sr. and Jr. asked Stenholm to head a newly conceived campus film production company, Unusual Films.  Stenholm then attended summer film school at the University of Southern California, making important professional contacts and serving an internship with Stanley Kramer.   Stenholm was a quick learner and soon \"became one of only a handful of women in the United States to direct feature films.\"  Through her career she produced seventy-two films of various types including sermon films, religious documentaries, promotional films, and multi-image presentations.  She directed five feature-length religious films, all costume dramas: \n\nWine of Morning\nRed Runs the River\nFlame in the Wind\nSheffey\nBeyond the Night.The National Evangelical Film Foundation named Stenholm Director of the Year in 1953, 1955, and 1963; and her favorite film, Sheffey, received a Silver Medallion award from the International Film and Television Festival of New York.In 1958, at the height of the Cold War, the University Film Producers Association selected Wine of Morning as its submission to the International Congress of Motion Picture and Television School Directors at the Cannes Film Festival, and Stenholm was the keynote speaker on the occasion. A U.S. State Department official who briefed Stenholm told her there had been a round of applause when the Department discovered that BJU had been chosen to represent the United States because \"Bob Jones University is one school about which there is no worry!\" The selection committee thought Wine of Morning would demonstrate the excellence of American cinema training and the film's frank religious message would \"provide a revealing contrast to the entries from Russia and the other Communist-dominated countries.\"In 1986, Stenholm suffered a stroke in the Soviet Union while taking scenic footage in preparation for another feature-length film.  She retired as director of Unusual Films but continued to teach at BJU until 2001. Stenholm died in November 2015 at the age of 98.\nPassage 8:\nJesse E.
