In other words, how many non-repeating paragraphs are there in total?\n\nParagraph 1: In 2005, Sega partnered with Atmos Tokyo to produce sports-themed iDogs as part of a new line, titled \"iDog x Atmos\". In 2007, Tiger Electronics released the iDog Amp'd, an upgraded version of the iDog with stereo speakers that nod its head and tap its foot in time with the music being played.  The iDog Pup, a puppy version of the iDog with poseable ears and a moving head, was released in 2007 and was a localized version of the iDog Mini released in Japan in 2005. Also in 2007, two variants called \"SpiDogs\" were released to promote the film Spider-Man 3. They resemble the standard Spider-Man costume and the Black Suit respectively. In 2008, three new versions of the iDog were released. The iDog Clip is a fully functional mini-sized iDog which can be clipped onto a backpack, the iDog Dance is a larger version of the iDog that stands up and dances in time to the music, it also features 7 touch sensors (like the iCat), and the iDog Soft Speaker, a plush version of the iDog Amp'd that remixes some songs on it and has a pocket where the battery compartment is so you can store things in it. In 2009, as one of the last iDogs released, Hasbro released the iDog Plush Puppy. This smaller plush iDog came in pink and purple and was one of the first iDogs that didn't need batteries. It came with a cord attached to it, like the iDog Clip. But it had the light patterns stitched onto it.\n\nParagraph 2: While in the USWA Thompson became friends with a wrestler known as \"The Awesome Kong\" and the two decided to form a tag team. Being similar in stature to Awesome Kong Thompson began to wrestle wearing a black wrestling mask as well as growing his beard out as he wrestled as \"King Kong\", collectively King Kong and Awesome Kong were known as \"The Colossal Kongs\". In mid-1993 the Kongs worked for Big D Pro Wrestling (BDPW) as well as the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). During their tenure in the GWF they were involved in a storyline against the then reigning GWF Tag Team Champion The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), but never won the championship. In the same year, the team signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WCW they were managed by Harley Race, the duo competed in WCW's tag team division. Their first real match on a national level took place as Clash of the Champions XXIV where the team lost to Sting and Ric Flair. Later on both of the Colossal Kong's competed in the 1993 Battlebowl tournament part of the WCW Pay Per View (PPV) of the same name. In the tournament King Kong teamed up with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Awesome Kong and The Equalizer, with the storyline being that the teams were \"randomly drawn\" to face off. Winning the match meant that King Kong was one of 20 wrestlers competing in a battle royal at the end of the night, won by Big Van Vader. King Kong would also work WCW's 1993 Starrcade show, losing to The Shockmaster in a singles match. The PPV loss was one of Thompson's last matches for WCW, after which he returned to the independent circuit in Texas. At this point he had tweaked his ring name outside of WCW to \"Krusher Kong\" instead of the more generic \"King Kong\". In Texas he held the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship for 73 days, until he lost it to Eclipse on August 14, 1998. He would later hold the Pro Wrestling Championship (PCW) title in 2001 as well as the Texas Championship Wrestling (later renamed Xtreme Championship Wrestling) singles title and the tag team titles twice in 2003. Kong wrestled his last match in 2010.\n\nParagraph 3: The present-day Louvre Palace is a vast complex of wings and pavilions which, although superficially homogeneous in scale and architecture, is the result of many phases of building, modification, destruction and reconstruction. Its apparent stylistic consistency is largely due to conscious efforts of architects over several centuries to echo each other's work and preserve a strong sense of historical continuity, mirroring that of the French monarchy and state; American essayist Adam Gopnik has written that \"The continuity the Louvre represents is the continuity of the French state.\" For example, from the 1620s to the 1650s Jacques Lemercier thoroughly replicated the Lescot Wing's patterns for his design of the northern half of the western wing of the Cour Carr\u00e9e. In the 1660s Louis Le Vau echoed Lemercier's Pavillon de l'Horloge for his redesign of the central pavillon of the Tuileries Palace further west (burnt in 1871 and demolished in 1883), and mostly continued Lescot's and Lemercier's pattern for the completion of the Cour Carr\u00e9e. A separate design a few years later, that associated with Claude Perrault for the Louvre Colonnade, included window shapes on the ground level based on Lescot's for the Pavillon du Roi a century earlier, ensuring visual continuity even though the dramatic colonnade on the upper level was different from anything that had been done at the Louvre so far. In the 1810s, Percier and Fontaine copied the giant order of the western section of the Grande Galerie, built in the early 17th century and attributed to Jacques II Androuet du Cerceau, for their design of the northern wing to connect the Tuileries with the Louvre along the rue de Rivoli. In the 1850s during Napoleon III's Louvre expansion, architects Louis Visconti then Hector Lefuel built the Denon and Richelieu pavilions as echoes of Lemercier's Pavillon de l'Horloge. In the 1860s and 1870s, Lefuel used designs inspired by the Lescot Wing even as he replaced the prior giant-order patterns created by Androuet du Cerceau and replicated by Percier and Fontaine. Finally, in the 1980s, I. M. Pei made explicit reference to Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, the designer of the Tuileries Garden, for his design of the Louvre Pyramid.\n\nParagraph 4: Helen James (2004) stated that in the late 17th-century Burmese Restored Toungoo dynasty 'the transfer of power upon the death of a monarch was always a problem, for there were many contenders to the throne owing to the practice of polygamy. The sons of the major queens frequently contested the succession.' Alaungpaya, founder of the new Konbaung dynasty (1752\u20131885), intended his successors to be appointed by agnatic seniority (from brother to brother), according to James in an attempt 'to avoid the bloodshed that accompanied each transfer of power at the death of a Burmese monarch. It was a vain hope. The directive itself led to bloody succession crises, as some of his sons sought to pass the crown to their sons instead of their brothers, thereby thwarting Alaungpaya's dying wish.' His oldest son Naungdawgyi had to fight a two-year war of succession (1760\u20131762) to assert his authority. Hsinbyushin's succession was not challenged, but designating his son Singu Min as heir rather than a younger brother bred an imminent succession dispute just before his death. The next king Singu managed to avoid a war of succession by having most of his potential rivals killed or exiled in a timely manner, although Singu's reign was cut short by a princely rebellion in February 1782, in which Phaungkaza Maung Maung seized the throne for seven days before Bodawpaya killed and replaced him. Bodawpaya successfully eliminated all his rivals upon enthronement, and in 1802 ended 'twenty-five years of conflict between lineal and collateral succession' in favour of the former, according to Koenig (1990). Nevertheless, two kings were overthrown by their brothers in coups in 1837 and 1853, and in 1866 the crown prince (the king's brother) was assassinated by two of the king's sons. When the last Burmese king Thibaw Min (r. 1878\u20131885) began his reign, he had about 80 of his relatives murdered to prevent any challenge to his accession.\n\nParagraph 5: Developed by Atari Melbourne House and released for PlayStation 2 by Atari on May 11, 2004 in North America and May 7, 2004 in Europe, the Transformers video game (originally called Transformers Armada: Prelude to Energon, but simply titled again as Transformers.) is loosely based on the Armada series. In the game you play as three Autobots: Optimus Prime, Hot Shot, and Red Alert. The general story is the same as the TV show, you must find and collect the Mini-Cons and fight off Megatron and his Decepticons. In the game, you travel through various large environments on Earth (such as the Amazon Jungle and Antarctica) while fighting off Megatron's \"Decepticlone\" army and finding Mini-Cons that give the player's character different abilities in order to get further into the game. The player will also fight a number of familiar Decepticons from the Armada show, such as Starscream, Cyclonus, and Tidal Wave. The plot is similar to Armada, right down to the final battle with Unicron at the end. A few of the voice actors from the show (notably Garry Chalk as Prime and David Kaye as Megatron) voiced for the game. There are also subtle references to The Transformers: The Movie. The game is rated T on the ESRB ratings scale.\n\nParagraph 6: While in the USWA Thompson became friends with a wrestler known as \"The Awesome Kong\" and the two decided to form a tag team.

The smaller Dakla stela dates to Year 24 of the Nubian king Piye. This could mean that Takelot III and Piye were near contemporaries during their respective reigns. It suggested that an important graffito at Wadi Gasus\u2014which apparently links the God's Wife Amenirdis I (hence Shabaka here) to Year 19 of a God's Wife Shepenupet\u2014is a synchronism between a Nubian ruler and an Upper Egyptian Libyan king thereby equating Year 12 of Shabaka to Takelot III (rather than the short-lived Rudamun). This graffito would have been carved prior to Piye's Nubian conquest of Egypt in his 20th Year\u2014by which time both Takelot III and Rudamun had already died. However, new evidence on the Wadi Gasus graffito published by Claus Jurman in 2006 has now redated the carving to the 25th dynastic Nubian period entirely\u2014to Year 12 of Shabaka and Year 19 of Taharqa rather than to the 23rd dynastic Libyan era\u2014and demonstrates that they instead pertain to Amenirdis I and Shepenupet II respectively based on palaegraphic and other evidence collated by Jurman at Karnak rather than the Nubian Amenirdis I and the Libyan Shepenupet I, daughter of Osorkon III. The God's Wife Shepenupet II was Piye's daughter and Taharqa's sister. Jurman notes that no evidence from the innermost sanctuary of the chapel of Osiris Heqadjet at Karnak shows Shepenupet I associated with Piye's daughter, Amenirdis I. The Wadi Gasus graffiti were written in 2 separate handstyles and the year date formulas for '12' and '19' were also written differently which suggests that they are unlikely to have been composed at the same time. This means that the Year 19 date cannot be assigned to Takelot III and likely belongs to the Nubian king Taharqa instead.\n\nParagraph 10: The present-day Louvre Palace is a vast complex of wings and pavilions which, although superficially homogeneous in scale and architecture, is the result of many phases of building, modification, destruction and reconstruction.

Unlike ordinary concrete, CLSM has much lower strength. The strength of CLSM is less than , while ordinary concrete has strengths exceeding . As a result, CLSM is not suitable for supporting buildings, bridges, or other structures. Instead, it is primarily used as a replacement for compacted backfill. It also flows much better than ordinary concrete, having the consistency of a milkshake. The first known use of CLSM was in 1964. CLSM is typically a ready mix concrete rather than soil cement which is a low strength cement made using local soil, and is similar to a slurry.\n\nParagraph 17: Floyd Gahman (1894 \u2013 1979) was a noted American landscape and building artist who specialized in oil paintings of the New England and mid-Atlantic area. He was born in 1894 in Elida, Ohio, and died in 1979 in New York City, New York. In the 1950s, he was head of the Arts Department at the Ogontz Campus of Pennsylvania State University in Abington, PA. He maintained a studio on campus and made woodblock prints of landscapes which he sent to friends and family at Christmas time. <son of a fellow faculty member and close acquaintance>. He was named as a National Academician in 1969 and listed in Who's Who in America.  \n\nParagraph 18: While in the USWA Thompson became friends with a wrestler known as \"The Awesome Kong\" and the two decided to form a tag team. Being similar in stature to Awesome Kong Thompson began to wrestle wearing a black wrestling mask as well as growing his beard out as he wrestled as \"King Kong\", collectively King Kong and Awesome Kong were known as \"The Colossal Kongs\". In mid-1993 the Kongs worked for Big D Pro Wrestling (BDPW) as well as the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). During their tenure in the GWF they were involved in a storyline against the then reigning GWF Tag Team Champion The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), but never won the championship. In the same year, the team signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WCW they were managed by Harley Race, the duo competed in WCW's tag team division. Their first real match on a national level took place as Clash of the Champions XXIV where the team lost to Sting and Ric Flair. Later on both of the Colossal Kong's competed in the 1993 Battlebowl tournament part of the WCW Pay Per View (PPV) of the same name. In the tournament King Kong teamed up with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Awesome Kong and The Equalizer, with the storyline being that the teams were \"randomly drawn\" to face off. Winning the match meant that King Kong was one of 20 wrestlers competing in a battle royal at the end of the night, won by Big Van Vader. King Kong would also work WCW's 1993 Starrcade show, losing to The Shockmaster in a singles match. The PPV loss was one of Thompson's last matches for WCW, after which he returned to the independent circuit in Texas. At this point he had tweaked his ring name outside of WCW to \"Krusher Kong\" instead of the more generic \"King Kong\". In Texas he held the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship for 73 days, until he lost it to Eclipse on August 14, 1998. He would later hold the Pro Wrestling Championship (PCW) title in 2001 as well as the Texas Championship Wrestling (later renamed Xtreme Championship Wrestling) singles title and the tag team titles twice in 2003.

In the game you play as three Autobots: Optimus Prime, Hot Shot, and Red Alert. The general story is the same as the TV show, you must find and collect the Mini-Cons and fight off Megatron and his Decepticons. In the game, you travel through various large environments on Earth (such as the Amazon Jungle and Antarctica) while fighting off Megatron's \"Decepticlone\" army and finding Mini-Cons that give the player's character different abilities in order to get further into the game. The player will also fight a number of familiar Decepticons from the Armada show, such as Starscream, Cyclonus, and Tidal Wave. The plot is similar to Armada, right down to the final battle with Unicron at the end. A few of the voice actors from the show (notably Garry Chalk as Prime and David Kaye as Megatron) voiced for the game. There are also subtle references to The Transformers: The Movie. The game is rated T on the ESRB ratings scale.\n\nParagraph 22: Helen James (2004) stated that in the late 17th-century Burmese Restored Toungoo dynasty 'the transfer of power upon the death of a monarch was always a problem, for there were many contenders to the throne owing to the practice of polygamy. The sons of the major queens frequently contested the succession.' Alaungpaya, founder of the new Konbaung dynasty (1752\u20131885), intended his successors to be appointed by agnatic seniority (from brother to brother), according to James in an attempt 'to avoid the bloodshed that accompanied each transfer of power at the death of a Burmese monarch. It was a vain hope. The directive itself led to bloody succession crises, as some of his sons sought to pass the crown to their sons instead of their brothers, thereby thwarting Alaungpaya's dying wish.' His oldest son Naungdawgyi had to fight a two-year war of succession (1760\u20131762) to assert his authority. Hsinbyushin's succession was not challenged, but designating his son Singu Min as heir rather than a younger brother bred an imminent succession dispute just before his death. The next king Singu managed to avoid a war of succession by having most of his potential rivals killed or exiled in a timely manner, although Singu's reign was cut short by a princely rebellion in February 1782, in which Phaungkaza Maung Maung seized the throne for seven days before Bodawpaya killed and replaced him. Bodawpaya successfully eliminated all his rivals upon enthronement, and in 1802 ended 'twenty-five years of conflict between lineal and collateral succession' in favour of the former, according to Koenig (1990). Nevertheless, two kings were overthrown by their brothers in coups in 1837 and 1853, and in 1866 the crown prince (the king's brother) was assassinated by two of the king's sons. When the last Burmese king Thibaw Min (r. 1878\u20131885) began his reign, he had about 80 of his relatives murdered to prevent any challenge to his accession.\n\nParagraph 23: The governor mentioned here is Nes-Djehuti or Esdhuti who appears as the Chief of the Shamin Libyans in both the aforementioned Year 13 stela of Takelot III and also in the Smaller Dakhla Stela. The smaller Dakla stela dates to Year 24 of the Nubian king Piye. This could mean that Takelot III and Piye were near contemporaries during their respective reigns. It suggested that an important graffito at Wadi Gasus\u2014which apparently links the God's Wife Amenirdis I (hence Shabaka here) to Year 19 of a God's Wife Shepenupet\u2014is a synchronism between a Nubian ruler and an Upper Egyptian Libyan king thereby equating Year 12 of Shabaka to Takelot III (rather than the short-lived Rudamun). This graffito would have been carved prior to Piye's Nubian conquest of Egypt in his 20th Year\u2014by which time both Takelot III and Rudamun had already died. However, new evidence on the Wadi Gasus graffito published by Claus Jurman in 2006 has now redated the carving to the 25th dynastic Nubian period entirely\u2014to Year 12 of Shabaka and Year 19 of Taharqa rather than to the 23rd dynastic Libyan era\u2014and demonstrates that they instead pertain to Amenirdis I and Shepenupet II respectively based on palaegraphic and other evidence collated by Jurman at Karnak rather than the Nubian Amenirdis I and the Libyan Shepenupet I, daughter of Osorkon III. The God's Wife Shepenupet II was Piye's daughter and Taharqa's sister. Jurman notes that no evidence from the innermost sanctuary of the chapel of Osiris Heqadjet at Karnak shows Shepenupet I associated with Piye's daughter, Amenirdis I. The Wadi Gasus graffiti were written in 2 separate handstyles and the year date formulas for '12' and '19' were also written differently which suggests that they are unlikely to have been composed at the same time. This means that the Year 19 date cannot be assigned to Takelot III and likely belongs to the Nubian king Taharqa instead.\n\nParagraph 24: CLSM consists of a mixture of Portland cement, water, aggregate and sometimes fly ash.

Being similar in stature to Awesome Kong Thompson began to wrestle wearing a black wrestling mask as well as growing his beard out as he wrestled as \"King Kong\", collectively King Kong and Awesome Kong were known as \"The Colossal Kongs\". In mid-1993 the Kongs worked for Big D Pro Wrestling (BDPW) as well as the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). During their tenure in the GWF they were involved in a storyline against the then reigning GWF Tag Team Champion The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), but never won the championship. In the same year, the team signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WCW they were managed by Harley Race, the duo competed in WCW's tag team division. Their first real match on a national level took place as Clash of the Champions XXIV where the team lost to Sting and Ric Flair. Later on both of the Colossal Kong's competed in the 1993 Battlebowl tournament part of the WCW Pay Per View (PPV) of the same name. In the tournament King Kong teamed up with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Awesome Kong and The Equalizer, with the storyline being that the teams were \"randomly drawn\" to face off. Winning the match meant that King Kong was one of 20 wrestlers competing in a battle royal at the end of the night, won by Big Van Vader. King Kong would also work WCW's 1993 Starrcade show, losing to The Shockmaster in a singles match. The PPV loss was one of Thompson's last matches for WCW, after which he returned to the independent circuit in Texas. At this point he had tweaked his ring name outside of WCW to \"Krusher Kong\" instead of the more generic \"King Kong\". In Texas he held the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship for 73 days, until he lost it to Eclipse on August 14, 1998.

The directive itself led to bloody succession crises, as some of his sons sought to pass the crown to their sons instead of their brothers, thereby thwarting Alaungpaya's dying wish.' His oldest son Naungdawgyi had to fight a two-year war of succession (1760\u20131762) to assert his authority. Hsinbyushin's succession was not challenged, but designating his son Singu Min as heir rather than a younger brother bred an imminent succession dispute just before his death. The next king Singu managed to avoid a war of succession by having most of his potential rivals killed or exiled in a timely manner, although Singu's reign was cut short by a princely rebellion in February 1782, in which Phaungkaza Maung Maung seized the throne for seven days before Bodawpaya killed and replaced him. Bodawpaya successfully eliminated all his rivals upon enthronement, and in 1802 ended 'twenty-five years of conflict between lineal and collateral succession' in favour of the former, according to Koenig (1990). Nevertheless, two kings were overthrown by their brothers in coups in 1837 and 1853, and in 1866 the crown prince (the king's brother) was assassinated by two of the king's sons. When the last Burmese king Thibaw Min (r. 1878\u20131885) began his reign, he had about 80 of his relatives murdered to prevent any challenge to his accession.\n\nParagraph 40: The governor mentioned here is Nes-Djehuti or Esdhuti who appears as the Chief of the Shamin Libyans in both the aforementioned Year 13 stela of Takelot III and also in the Smaller Dakhla Stela. The smaller Dakla stela dates to Year 24 of the Nubian king Piye. This could mean that Takelot III and Piye were near contemporaries during their respective reigns. It suggested that an important graffito at Wadi Gasus\u2014which apparently links the God's Wife Amenirdis I (hence Shabaka here) to Year 19 of a God's Wife Shepenupet\u2014is a synchronism between a Nubian ruler and an Upper Egyptian Libyan king thereby equating Year 12 of Shabaka to Takelot III (rather than the short-lived Rudamun). This graffito would have been carved prior to Piye's Nubian conquest of Egypt in his 20th Year\u2014by which time both Takelot III and Rudamun had already died. However, new evidence on the Wadi Gasus graffito published by Claus Jurman in 2006 has now redated the carving to the 25th dynastic Nubian period entirely\u2014to Year 12 of Shabaka and Year 19 of Taharqa rather than to the 23rd dynastic Libyan era\u2014and demonstrates that they instead pertain to Amenirdis I and Shepenupet II respectively based on palaegraphic and other evidence collated by Jurman at Karnak rather than the Nubian Amenirdis I and the Libyan Shepenupet I, daughter of Osorkon III. The God's Wife Shepenupet II was Piye's daughter and Taharqa's sister. Jurman notes that no evidence from the innermost sanctuary of the chapel of Osiris Heqadjet at Karnak shows Shepenupet I associated with Piye's daughter, Amenirdis I. The Wadi Gasus graffiti were written in 2 separate handstyles and the year date formulas for '12' and '19' were also written differently which suggests that they are unlikely to have been composed at the same time. This means that the Year 19 date cannot be assigned to Takelot III and likely belongs to the Nubian king Taharqa instead.\n\nPlease enter the final count of unique paragraphs after removing duplicates.

In 2007, Tiger Electronics released the iDog Amp'd, an upgraded version of the iDog with stereo speakers that nod its head and tap its foot in time with the music being played.  The iDog Pup, a puppy version of the iDog with poseable ears and a moving head, was released in 2007 and was a localized version of the iDog Mini released in Japan in 2005. Also in 2007, two variants called \"SpiDogs\" were released to promote the film Spider-Man 3. They resemble the standard Spider-Man costume and the Black Suit respectively. In 2008, three new versions of the iDog were released. The iDog Clip is a fully functional mini-sized iDog which can be clipped onto a backpack, the iDog Dance is a larger version of the iDog that stands up and dances in time to the music, it also features 7 touch sensors (like the iCat), and the iDog Soft Speaker, a plush version of the iDog Amp'd that remixes some songs on it and has a pocket where the battery compartment is so you can store things in it. In 2009, as one of the last iDogs released, Hasbro released the iDog Plush Puppy. This smaller plush iDog came in pink and purple and was one of the first iDogs that didn't need batteries. It came with a cord attached to it, like the iDog Clip. But it had the light patterns stitched onto it.\n\nParagraph 2: While in the USWA Thompson became friends with a wrestler known as \"The Awesome Kong\" and the two decided to form a tag team. Being similar in stature to Awesome Kong Thompson began to wrestle wearing a black wrestling mask as well as growing his beard out as he wrestled as \"King Kong\", collectively King Kong and Awesome Kong were known as \"The Colossal Kongs\". In mid-1993 the Kongs worked for Big D Pro Wrestling (BDPW) as well as the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). During their tenure in the GWF they were involved in a storyline against the then reigning GWF Tag Team Champion The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), but never won the championship. In the same year, the team signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WCW they were managed by Harley Race, the duo competed in WCW's tag team division. Their first real match on a national level took place as Clash of the Champions XXIV where the team lost to Sting and Ric Flair. Later on both of the Colossal Kong's competed in the 1993 Battlebowl tournament part of the WCW Pay Per View (PPV) of the same name. In the tournament King Kong teamed up with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Awesome Kong and The Equalizer, with the storyline being that the teams were \"randomly drawn\" to face off. Winning the match meant that King Kong was one of 20 wrestlers competing in a battle royal at the end of the night, won by Big Van Vader. King Kong would also work WCW's 1993 Starrcade show, losing to The Shockmaster in a singles match. The PPV loss was one of Thompson's last matches for WCW, after which he returned to the independent circuit in Texas. At this point he had tweaked his ring name outside of WCW to \"Krusher Kong\" instead of the more generic \"King Kong\". In Texas he held the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship for 73 days, until he lost it to Eclipse on August 14, 1998. He would later hold the Pro Wrestling Championship (PCW) title in 2001 as well as the Texas Championship Wrestling (later renamed Xtreme Championship Wrestling) singles title and the tag team titles twice in 2003. Kong wrestled his last match in 2010.\n\nParagraph 3: The present-day Louvre Palace is a vast complex of wings and pavilions which, although superficially homogeneous in scale and architecture, is the result of many phases of building, modification, destruction and reconstruction. Its apparent stylistic consistency is largely due to conscious efforts of architects over several centuries to echo each other's work and preserve a strong sense of historical continuity, mirroring that of the French monarchy and state; American essayist Adam Gopnik has written that \"The continuity the Louvre represents is the continuity of the French state.\" For example, from the 1620s to the 1650s Jacques Lemercier thoroughly replicated the Lescot Wing's patterns for his design of the northern half of the western wing of the Cour Carr\u00e9e. In the 1660s Louis Le Vau echoed Lemercier's Pavillon de l'Horloge for his redesign of the central pavillon of the Tuileries Palace further west (burnt in 1871 and demolished in 1883), and mostly continued Lescot's and Lemercier's pattern for the completion of the Cour Carr\u00e9e. A separate design a few years later, that associated with Claude Perrault for the Louvre Colonnade, included window shapes on the ground level based on Lescot's for the Pavillon du Roi a century earlier, ensuring visual continuity even though the dramatic colonnade on the upper level was different from anything that had been done at the Louvre so far. In the 1810s, Percier and Fontaine copied the giant order of the western section of the Grande Galerie, built in the early 17th century and attributed to Jacques II Androuet du Cerceau, for their design of the northern wing to connect the Tuileries with the Louvre along the rue de Rivoli. In the 1850s during Napoleon III's Louvre expansion, architects Louis Visconti then Hector Lefuel built the Denon and Richelieu pavilions as echoes of Lemercier's Pavillon de l'Horloge. In the 1860s and 1870s, Lefuel used designs inspired by the Lescot Wing even as he replaced the prior giant-order patterns created by Androuet du Cerceau and replicated by Percier and Fontaine. Finally, in the 1980s, I. M. Pei made explicit reference to Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, the designer of the Tuileries Garden, for his design of the Louvre Pyramid.\n\nParagraph 4: Helen James (2004) stated that in the late 17th-century Burmese Restored Toungoo dynasty 'the transfer of power upon the death of a monarch was always a problem, for there were many contenders to the throne owing to the practice of polygamy.

In the game you play as three Autobots: Optimus Prime, Hot Shot, and Red Alert. The general story is the same as the TV show, you must find and collect the Mini-Cons and fight off Megatron and his Decepticons. In the game, you travel through various large environments on Earth (such as the Amazon Jungle and Antarctica) while fighting off Megatron's \"Decepticlone\" army and finding Mini-Cons that give the player's character different abilities in order to get further into the game. The player will also fight a number of familiar Decepticons from the Armada show, such as Starscream, Cyclonus, and Tidal Wave. The plot is similar to Armada, right down to the final battle with Unicron at the end. A few of the voice actors from the show (notably Garry Chalk as Prime and David Kaye as Megatron) voiced for the game. There are also subtle references to The Transformers: The Movie. The game is rated T on the ESRB ratings scale.\n\nParagraph 6: While in the USWA Thompson became friends with a wrestler known as \"The Awesome Kong\" and the two decided to form a tag team.

Unlike ordinary concrete, CLSM has much lower strength. The strength of CLSM is less than , while ordinary concrete has strengths exceeding .

He was born in 1894 in Elida, Ohio, and died in 1979 in New York City, New York. In the 1950s, he was head of the Arts Department at the Ogontz Campus of Pennsylvania State University in Abington, PA. He maintained a studio on campus and made woodblock prints of landscapes which he sent to friends and family at Christmas time. <son of a fellow faculty member and close acquaintance>. He was named as a National Academician in 1969 and listed in Who's Who in America.  \n\nParagraph 18: While in the USWA Thompson became friends with a wrestler known as \"The Awesome Kong\" and the two decided to form a tag team. Being similar in stature to Awesome Kong Thompson began to wrestle wearing a black wrestling mask as well as growing his beard out as he wrestled as \"King Kong\", collectively King Kong and Awesome Kong were known as \"The Colossal Kongs\". In mid-1993 the Kongs worked for Big D Pro Wrestling (BDPW) as well as the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). During their tenure in the GWF they were involved in a storyline against the then reigning GWF Tag Team Champion The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), but never won the championship. In the same year, the team signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WCW they were managed by Harley Race, the duo competed in WCW's tag team division. Their first real match on a national level took place as Clash of the Champions XXIV where the team lost to Sting and Ric Flair. Later on both of the Colossal Kong's competed in the 1993 Battlebowl tournament part of the WCW Pay Per View (PPV) of the same name. In the tournament King Kong teamed up with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Awesome Kong and The Equalizer, with the storyline being that the teams were \"randomly drawn\" to face off. Winning the match meant that King Kong was one of 20 wrestlers competing in a battle royal at the end of the night, won by Big Van Vader. King Kong would also work WCW's 1993 Starrcade show, losing to The Shockmaster in a singles match. The PPV loss was one of Thompson's last matches for WCW, after which he returned to the independent circuit in Texas. At this point he had tweaked his ring name outside of WCW to \"Krusher Kong\" instead of the more generic \"King Kong\". In Texas he held the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship for 73 days, until he lost it to Eclipse on August 14, 1998. He would later hold the Pro Wrestling Championship (PCW) title in 2001 as well as the Texas Championship Wrestling (later renamed Xtreme Championship Wrestling) singles title and the tag team titles twice in 2003. Kong wrestled his last match in 2010.\n\nParagraph 19: Floyd Gahman (1894 \u2013 1979) was a noted American landscape and building artist who specialized in oil paintings of the New England and mid-Atlantic area.

In the game you play as three Autobots: Optimus Prime, Hot Shot, and Red Alert. The general story is the same as the TV show, you must find and collect the Mini-Cons and fight off Megatron and his Decepticons. In the game, you travel through various large environments on Earth (such as the Amazon Jungle and Antarctica) while fighting off Megatron's \"Decepticlone\" army and finding Mini-Cons that give the player's character different abilities in order to get further into the game. The player will also fight a number of familiar Decepticons from the Armada show, such as Starscream, Cyclonus, and Tidal Wave. The plot is similar to Armada, right down to the final battle with Unicron at the end. A few of the voice actors from the show (notably Garry Chalk as Prime and David Kaye as Megatron) voiced for the game. There are also subtle references to The Transformers: The Movie. The game is rated T on the ESRB ratings scale.\n\nParagraph 22: Helen James (2004) stated that in the late 17th-century Burmese Restored Toungoo dynasty 'the transfer of power upon the death of a monarch was always a problem, for there were many contenders to the throne owing to the practice of polygamy. The sons of the major queens frequently contested the succession.' Alaungpaya, founder of the new Konbaung dynasty (1752\u20131885), intended his successors to be appointed by agnatic seniority (from brother to brother), according to James in an attempt 'to avoid the bloodshed that accompanied each transfer of power at the death of a Burmese monarch. It was a vain hope. The directive itself led to bloody succession crises, as some of his sons sought to pass the crown to their sons instead of their brothers, thereby thwarting Alaungpaya's dying wish.' His oldest son Naungdawgyi had to fight a two-year war of succession (1760\u20131762) to assert his authority. Hsinbyushin's succession was not challenged, but designating his son Singu Min as heir rather than a younger brother bred an imminent succession dispute just before his death. The next king Singu managed to avoid a war of succession by having most of his potential rivals killed or exiled in a timely manner, although Singu's reign was cut short by a princely rebellion in February 1782, in which Phaungkaza Maung Maung seized the throne for seven days before Bodawpaya killed and replaced him. Bodawpaya successfully eliminated all his rivals upon enthronement, and in 1802 ended 'twenty-five years of conflict between lineal and collateral succession' in favour of the former, according to Koenig (1990). Nevertheless, two kings were overthrown by their brothers in coups in 1837 and 1853, and in 1866 the crown prince (the king's brother) was assassinated by two of the king's sons. When the last Burmese king Thibaw Min (r. 1878\u20131885) began his reign, he had about 80 of his relatives murdered to prevent any challenge to his accession.\n\nParagraph 23: The governor mentioned here is Nes-Djehuti or Esdhuti who appears as the Chief of the Shamin Libyans in both the aforementioned Year 13 stela of Takelot III and also in the Smaller Dakhla Stela. The smaller Dakla stela dates to Year 24 of the Nubian king Piye. This could mean that Takelot III and Piye were near contemporaries during their respective reigns. It suggested that an important graffito at Wadi Gasus\u2014which apparently links the God's Wife Amenirdis I (hence Shabaka here) to Year 19 of a God's Wife Shepenupet\u2014is a synchronism between a Nubian ruler and an Upper Egyptian Libyan king thereby equating Year 12 of Shabaka to Takelot III (rather than the short-lived Rudamun). This graffito would have been carved prior to Piye's Nubian conquest of Egypt in his 20th Year\u2014by which time both Takelot III and Rudamun had already died. However, new evidence on the Wadi Gasus graffito published by Claus Jurman in 2006 has now redated the carving to the 25th dynastic Nubian period entirely\u2014to Year 12 of Shabaka and Year 19 of Taharqa rather than to the 23rd dynastic Libyan era\u2014and demonstrates that they instead pertain to Amenirdis I and Shepenupet II respectively based on palaegraphic and other evidence collated by Jurman at Karnak rather than the Nubian Amenirdis I and the Libyan Shepenupet I, daughter of Osorkon III. The God's Wife Shepenupet II was Piye's daughter and Taharqa's sister. Jurman notes that no evidence from the innermost sanctuary of the chapel of Osiris Heqadjet at Karnak shows Shepenupet I associated with Piye's daughter, Amenirdis I. The Wadi Gasus graffiti were written in 2 separate handstyles and the year date formulas for '12' and '19' were also written differently which suggests that they are unlikely to have been composed at the same time. This means that the Year 19 date cannot be assigned to Takelot III and likely belongs to the Nubian king Taharqa instead.\n\nParagraph 24: CLSM consists of a mixture of Portland cement, water, aggregate and sometimes fly ash.

In 2009, as one of the last iDogs released, Hasbro released the iDog Plush Puppy. This smaller plush iDog came in pink and purple and was one of the first iDogs that didn't need batteries. It came with a cord attached to it, like the iDog Clip. But it had the light patterns stitched onto it.\n\nParagraph 37: CLSM consists of a mixture of Portland cement, water, aggregate and sometimes fly ash. Unlike ordinary concrete, CLSM has much lower strength. The strength of CLSM is less than , while ordinary concrete has strengths exceeding . As a result, CLSM is not suitable for supporting buildings, bridges, or other structures. Instead, it is primarily used as a replacement for compacted backfill. It also flows much better than ordinary concrete, having the consistency of a milkshake. The first known use of CLSM was in 1964. CLSM is typically a ready mix concrete rather than soil cement which is a low strength cement made using local soil, and is similar to a slurry.\n\nParagraph 38: While in the USWA Thompson became friends with a wrestler known as \"The Awesome Kong\" and the two decided to form a tag team. Being similar in stature to Awesome Kong Thompson began to wrestle wearing a black wrestling mask as well as growing his beard out as he wrestled as \"King Kong\", collectively King Kong and Awesome Kong were known as \"The Colossal Kongs\". In mid-1993 the Kongs worked for Big D Pro Wrestling (BDPW) as well as the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). During their tenure in the GWF they were involved in a storyline against the then reigning GWF Tag Team Champion The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), but never won the championship. In the same year, the team signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WCW they were managed by Harley Race, the duo competed in WCW's tag team division. Their first real match on a national level took place as Clash of the Champions XXIV where the team lost to Sting and Ric Flair. Later on both of the Colossal Kong's competed in the 1993 Battlebowl tournament part of the WCW Pay Per View (PPV) of the same name. In the tournament King Kong teamed up with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Awesome Kong and The Equalizer, with the storyline being that the teams were \"randomly drawn\" to face off. Winning the match meant that King Kong was one of 20 wrestlers competing in a battle royal at the end of the night, won by Big Van Vader. King Kong would also work WCW's 1993 Starrcade show, losing to The Shockmaster in a singles match. The PPV loss was one of Thompson's last matches for WCW, after which he returned to the independent circuit in Texas. At this point he had tweaked his ring name outside of WCW to \"Krusher Kong\" instead of the more generic \"King Kong\". In Texas he held the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship for 73 days, until he lost it to Eclipse on August 14, 1998. He would later hold the Pro Wrestling Championship (PCW) title in 2001 as well as the Texas Championship Wrestling (later renamed Xtreme Championship Wrestling) singles title and the tag team titles twice in 2003. Kong wrestled his last match in 2010.\n\nParagraph 39: Helen James (2004) stated that in the late 17th-century Burmese Restored Toungoo dynasty 'the transfer of power upon the death of a monarch was always a problem, for there were many contenders to the throne owing to the practice of polygamy. The sons of the major queens frequently contested the succession.' Alaungpaya, founder of the new Konbaung dynasty (1752\u20131885), intended his successors to be appointed by agnatic seniority (from brother to brother), according to James in an attempt 'to avoid the bloodshed that accompanied each transfer of power at the death of a Burmese monarch. It was a vain hope. The directive itself led to bloody succession crises, as some of his sons sought to pass the crown to their sons instead of their brothers, thereby thwarting Alaungpaya's dying wish.' His oldest son Naungdawgyi had to fight a two-year war of succession (1760\u20131762) to assert his authority. Hsinbyushin's succession was not challenged, but designating his son Singu Min as heir rather than a younger brother bred an imminent succession dispute just before his death. The next king Singu managed to avoid a war of succession by having most of his potential rivals killed or exiled in a timely manner, although Singu's reign was cut short by a princely rebellion in February 1782, in which Phaungkaza Maung Maung seized the throne for seven days before Bodawpaya killed and replaced him. Bodawpaya successfully eliminated all his rivals upon enthronement, and in 1802 ended 'twenty-five years of conflict between lineal and collateral succession' in favour of the former, according to Koenig (1990). Nevertheless, two kings were overthrown by their brothers in coups in 1837 and 1853, and in 1866 the crown prince (the king's brother) was assassinated by two of the king's sons. When the last Burmese king Thibaw Min (r. 1878\u20131885) began his reign, he had about 80 of his relatives murdered to prevent any challenge to his accession.\n\nParagraph 40: The governor mentioned here is Nes-Djehuti or Esdhuti who appears as the Chief of the Shamin Libyans in both the aforementioned Year 13 stela of Takelot III and also in the Smaller Dakhla Stela. The smaller Dakla stela dates to Year 24 of the Nubian king Piye. This could mean that Takelot III and Piye were near contemporaries during their respective reigns. It suggested that an important graffito at Wadi Gasus\u2014which apparently links the God's Wife Amenirdis I (hence Shabaka here) to Year 19 of a God's Wife Shepenupet\u2014is a synchronism between a Nubian ruler and an Upper Egyptian Libyan king thereby equating Year 12 of Shabaka to Takelot III (rather than the short-lived Rudamun). This graffito would have been carved prior to Piye's Nubian conquest of Egypt in his 20th Year\u2014by which time both Takelot III and Rudamun had already died. However, new evidence on the Wadi Gasus graffito published by Claus Jurman in 2006 has now redated the carving to the 25th dynastic Nubian period entirely\u2014to Year 12 of Shabaka and Year 19 of Taharqa rather than to the 23rd dynastic Libyan era\u2014and demonstrates that they instead pertain to Amenirdis I and Shepenupet II respectively based on palaegraphic and other evidence collated by Jurman at Karnak rather than the Nubian Amenirdis I and the Libyan Shepenupet I, daughter of Osorkon III. The God's Wife Shepenupet II was Piye's daughter and Taharqa's sister. Jurman notes that no evidence from the innermost sanctuary of the chapel of Osiris Heqadjet at Karnak shows Shepenupet I associated with Piye's daughter, Amenirdis I. The Wadi Gasus graffiti were written in 2 separate handstyles and the year date formulas for '12' and '19' were also written differently which suggests that they are unlikely to have been composed at the same time. This means that the Year 19 date cannot be assigned to Takelot III and likely belongs to the Nubian king Taharqa instead.", "answers": ["8"], "pred": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2,", "length": 11221, "dataset": "passage_count", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "96387e4ae15da043d51ef61053087ad39e7b4f01fba3f2a2"}

It was there when the Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, was fought, and remained until December 1, when it rejoined the Army of the Potomac, and passed the winter of 1864 and 1865 in doing siege duty in the trenches in front of Petersburg, Va. The Regiment was engaged in all the skirmishes that took place during this period, the most important of which were Hatcher's Run, December 10, 1864; Hatcher's Run, February 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, 1865; Fort Fisher, Va., March 25, and Fort Stedman, same day. In the attack on Petersburg, April 2, 1865, the Regiment took a prominent and important part.  The night before, the 6th Corps was massed in front of Fort Fisher, ready for the assault.  Just at daybreak, Sunday morning, the lines advanced under a heavy fire, and carried the enemy's main lines by storm.  The Second Rhode Island started in the second line, but were the first to reach the works, and planted its colors on the parapet.  The enemy fled in great confusion, after their lines were pierced.  Lieutenant Frank S. Halliday, acting Adjutant of the Regiment, with a small party, carried a rebel fort mounting two guns, and turned them upon the enemy.  The whole affair was a glorious success, and caused the evacuation of the city on Monday morning, April 3. In the Battle of Sailors' Creek, Thursday following the above, April 6, the Regiment displayed great prowess.  About 5 o'clock, P. M., the division to which it was attached, advanced on the enemy's lines, and the Second Rhode Island attacked a part of the Naval Brigade, commanded by officers of the late rebel fleet.  The Regiment charged to within a few feet of their lines, when it met a severe flank fire, which forced it to retire.  The action as so close that men were bayoneted, and knocked down with the butts of muskets.  In the confusion, the colors of the Regiment were captured, but were quickly retaken.  The place where it charged was swampy, with water at least three feet deep, but the men pushed gallantly forward, and regained all the ground lost, causing the enemy to flee in great confusion, who left a part of their wagons in Federal hands.  The loss was severe in officers and men, but there was a proud satisfaction in knowing that the efforts of the Regiment hastened the surrender of Lee and his army. Captain Charles W. Gleason and Lieutenant William H. Perry, both gallant officers, were killed.  They were loved and respected by the Regiment. They entered the service as enlisted men at the beginning of the war, and by merit rose to their positions as officers.  In this battle the conduct of officers and men was in the highest degree commendable. The new men, who went into action for the first time, fought-like veterans.\n\nParagraph 2: On April 29, 2011, Ali Haddad was appointed Mouldi A\u00efssaoui as General Director of USM Alger.

The one is simply to enter a precomposed pasekh tsvey yudn, which is both displayed and stored as a single character \u05f2\u05b7 (U+FB1F). The second option is to enter the tsvey yudn ligature as a base character and then to enter a combining pasekh for display together with it. Although appearing to be a single character \u05f2\u05b7, it is stored digitally as two separate characters (U+05F2 U+05B7). These two forms can only be directly entered from a keyboard on which the ligature appears. As a result, a practice is developing where pasekh tsvey yudn are indicated by enclosing a pasekh between the elements of a two-character digraph. The pasekh aligns correctly only with the first yud (subject to conditions described in the next section) but the display is tolerably that of a fully marked digraph \u05d9\u05b7\u05d9 and in some display environments may be indistinguishable from one or both of the previous alternatives. However, this option requires the storage of three separate characters (U+05D9 U+05B7 U+05D9). As a fourth alternative, albeit the least stable typographically, the second of two consecutive yudn may be pointed \u05d9\u05d9\u05b7 (U+05D9 U+05D9 U+05B7). A pasekh yud is otherwise not part of any established Yiddish character repertoire, and its use in this context manifests conditions that are specific to computerized typography. The four possible representations of the pasekh tsvey yudn thus have even greater potential for causing confusion than do the other digraphs. A further potentially confusing option specific to computerized text production, but not a component of any Yiddish orthographic tradition, is the combination of a khirik with a tsvey yudn ligature to represent the consonant-vowel sequence yud \u2014 khirik yud, as \u05f2\u05b4 (U+05F2 U+05B4) rather than the correct \u05d9\u05d9\u05b4 (U+05D9 U+05D9 U+05B4).\n\nParagraph 5: The event in the series dates back to the late Ottoman rule of Syria (late 1890s\u2013early 1900s). The series tells the story of a man (Nassar) whose wife died while giving birth because his mother had gone to the home of the noble family of Abu Hashem in the neighborhood to help Umm Hashem with the birth of her baby. When Abu Hashim heard about the birth of the male child, he promised God that he would go on foot to the pilgrimage when his son reaches the age of seven. The years pass and the child becomes seven years old and some of the inhabitants of the neighborhood prepare to go to the pilgrimage, including Nassar and his mother. Nassar who wants to propose to the daughter of Abu Hashim before going for Hajj, believes that her father delays the matter because he refuses Nassar. Nassar enters into a fight with the bakery workers when he intervenes to protect an orphan boy (Rida). He is put in jail for two days during which he is subjected to ill-treatment. On the 7th birthday of Hashim, his father holds a birthday party and invites the majority of the residents of the neighborhood to his home as well as the head of the police department (Yuzbashi Hilmi). When Nassar comes out of prison, he sets his sights on retaliation against the head of the police department. Nassar goes to the celebration where the chief of police is to be shot but the bullet hits Hashem in the chest. Nassar immediately escapes and meets with Sayyah, another wanted man. Sayyah and Nassar goes to the cemetery to hide and they become friends. Hashem is saved by his uncle the doctor. Pilgrims go on their long journey to Mecca as planned despite Hashem's injury. Nassar asks to meet Arafa in order to meet his mother. Karkar, an informer who works for the head of the police, hears that Arafa met Nassar while talking to his friend. Arafa is being detained and he is forced to tell the police station where Nassar is. The police go to the cemetery and heavy gunfire starts. Sayyah is killed but Arafa, who is wounded, and Nassar manage to flee. Nassar and Arafah will end up in an orchard. The events follow and Nassar is sentenced to death and Arafa to five years in prison after fabricating to Nassar a charge of trying to kill the Wali. Days after overnight in the open they come to a gentleman (Abu Jawad) who lives with his family in Douma. Because Nassar wants to meet his mother before going to Palestine. Jawad goes to Shaghour to bring Nassar's mother to Douma but Jawad is caught after suspicion. The trouble continues on Nassar and he begins to search after Jawad. Nassar kidnaps Karkar to testify about Jawad's place and confesses to him but he is killed when Karkar tries to kill the brother of Jawad. Nassar then burns the bakery to distract the police force while he enters the outpost to look for Jawad. He fails to find him  and releases some prisoners instead. Nassar and Arafa return to a cave they have stayed in. Some young men join them and it turns out that they are the ones who was released. Nassar seeks help from Talib who works for Abu Hashim in a perfume shop. Talib is asked to enter the prison of the Hakam Dar with the help of the private driver to the deputy governor (Hakam Dar).\n\nParagraph 6: This rape experience creates some sort of turning point for the narrator, who decides after vomiting and crying that she has to use her brains to help her situation. She decides that she needs to \u201cfind a single wolf to keep away the pack\u201d and heads outside to find some higher ranked Russian to have an exclusive sexual relationship with so that she doesn't get viciously and spontaneously raped every day by different men. Out in the street she meets Anatol, a lieutenant from Ukraine. She flirts with him briefly and they agree to meet at her place at 7 pm. That night Petka arrives with some of his friends and makes himself at home. Petka and his friends shock the widow and the narrator as they place their food straight on the table, throw bones to the floor, and spit casually. Despite the narrator's worries that Petka and Anatol might clash over her, when Anatol comes he is at ease in her apartment and she discovers that his rank means very little to the Russians. Over the next days, Anatol comes to have sex with the narrator and a \"taboo\" is formed in that the Russians know that she is claimed. Anatol and his men come and go as they please and the widow's apartment is considered \"Anatol's men's restaurant\" but a restaurant where they bring the food. The narrator and the widow get food that the Russians bring and they benefit from the protection of Anatol's men against other Russian soldiers. The narrator also meets educated Russian soldiers, such as Andrei, and has many conversations about politics, fascism, and such. Petka shows up completely drunk in a fit of rage against the narrator and tries to hurt her but due to his drunkenness the widow and the narrator manage to push him out of the apartment. Among the many Russian visitors of the apartment, a pale blond lieutenant who has a lame leg and a clear dislike of the narrator rapes her one night, completely ignoring the \"taboo\" with Anatol. He arrives another day with a major and after conversing and drinking champagne; he asks the narrator if the major pleases her. The narrator realizes she has little choice considering Anatol has left and eventually decides to have sex with the major. She accepts the relationship with the major and does not call it rape since it is consensual. The major is very pleasant, shares his life with her, and brings her food and supplies such as candles.  The narrator contemplates her status as she agrees to have sexual relationships in return for goods and protection.\n\nParagraph 7: After this battle the Regiment was detailed as part of the garrison of Winchester, to protect it against guerrillas, as well as to escort trains to the front.

Practice pads may be designed to approximate the tension and response of a true drumhead when struck, or to provide less rebound to train the percussionist\u2019s muscles. They can be constructed in a variety of shapes and sizes, and are typically small and light enough to be easily portable. Many variations include harder or softer playing surfaces, non-skid bases (that can also double as muted playing surfaces), and fixing points allowing the pad to be connected to existing percussion hardware such as a cymbal or snare drum stand.\n\nParagraph 9: Kaduthuruthy St. Mary is known as Kaduthuruthy Muthiyamma (\u0d15\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d41\u0d30\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f \u0d2e\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e). Kaduthuruthy Valiapally is one of the churches where Virgin Mary appeared in front of the devotees as an old woman (\u0d2e\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e). Southists of Kaduthuruthy had been considering Virgin Mary is the patron of their church for the remembrance of their first set of churches in Kodungallur. According to Bishop Francis Roz in his report to Serra (1603/1604), says that he has read from a Chaldean book that there were 3 churches in Cranganore built by the Thomman Keenan and his descendants. Southist Christians of the Syriac Rite built 3 churches in Kodungallur immediately after they had been given permission to settle down in Kodungallur by the Chera King. They are in the Name of Virgin Mary, St. Thomas and St. Kuriakose. The old wooden buildings constructed for the first 3 churches are said to have last for four hundred years. First church building in Kaduthuruthy in the name of Virgin Mary (\u0d15\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e) had constructed from wooden logs in a square shape and known as Square Church. Those churches in Kodungallur constructed by Thomman Keenan and his companions were completely destroyed later, as a result of a continuous clash between the neighbouring kings.  But the church built in the name of St. Thomas had undergone many relocations and renovation, helped this church to survive until the 15th century and had reconstructed by Portuguese after the destruction of Cranganore. According to Mar Jacob Abuna (1533), Dionysio (1578), Bishop Francis Roz (1604) on their report says that the church which stood in Cranganore had been there from the third century and was built by Thomas of Cana. It is the Syriac liturgical tradition of Southists to being faithful to the Virgin Mary,  resulted them to accept Virgin Mary as the patron of the church built in Kaduthuruthy in fourth century. The same tradition is practiced in their other ancient churches like Udayamperoor, Mulanthuruthy, Kottayam Chungam and Kallissery. Later Southist community lost the control over the church in Mulanthuruthy and Udayamperoor. Their seamless faith is accounted by Virgin Mary and she revealed herself as an old woman in front of the devotees. This miraculous appearance of Virgin Mary happened in AD 1596, during the erection of the historic granite cross of Kaduthuruthy Vallyapalli. The sculpture and carving work of the Cross from a single stone block had completed with a total height of 50 feet in AD 1596. It is believed that the iconic Kaduthuruthy Vallyapalli Cross is the highest open air cross in Asia, made out from a single block. Being monolithic in its shape, which in fact proclaiming the glory of Kaduthuruthy Valiapally and the Southists of Kaduthuruthy. As it is gigantic in structure, it was very difficult to upright the cross and to position in the courtyard of the Vallyapalli. During that time when they faced difficulty to upright the cross, Virgin Mary-the patron of the Kaduthuruthy Valiapally revealed herself as an old woman (Muthiyamma) and helped them to upright the cross miraculously by supporting the cross by her hand. Kaduthuruthy Valiapally is one of the churches blessed by Virgin Mary by appearing in front of the devotees as an old woman. There after the Blessed Virgin Mary residing in Kaduthuruthy Valiapally known as Kaduthuruthy Muthiyamma. Bishop Alexis Dom Menesis had carried out the inaugural blessing of the Cross situated on the courtyard of this Church, during the Holy Friday of 1599.\n\nParagraph 10: A variety of practice pads have been developed to assist percussionists in different ways.

Many variations include harder or softer playing surfaces, non-skid bases (that can also double as muted playing surfaces), and fixing points allowing the pad to be connected to existing percussion hardware such as a cymbal or snare drum stand.\n\nParagraph 11: In addition to a material being certified as biocompatible, biomaterials must be engineered specifically to their target application within a medical device. This is especially important in terms of mechanical properties which govern the way that a given biomaterial behaves. One of the most relevant material parameters is the Young's Modulus, E, which describes a material's elastic response to stresses. The Young's Moduli of the tissue and the device that is being coupled to it must closely match for optimal compatibility between device and body, whether the device is implanted or mounted externally. Matching the elastic modulus makes it possible to limit movement and delamination at the biointerface between implant and tissue as well as avoiding stress concentration that can lead to mechanical failure. Other important properties are the tensile and compressive strengths which quantify the maximum stresses a material can withstand before breaking and may be used to set stress limits that a device may be subject to within or external to the body. Depending on the application, it may be desirable for a biomaterial to have high strength so that it is resistant to failure when subjected to a load, however in other applications it may be beneficial for the material to be low strength. There is a careful balance between strength and stiffness that determines how robust to failure the biomaterial device is. Typically, as the elasticity of the biomaterial increases, the ultimate tensile strength will decrease and vice versa. One application where a high-strength material is undesired is in neural probes; if a high-strength material is used in these applications the tissue will always fail before the device does (under applied load) because the Young's Modulus of the dura mater and cerebral tissue is on the order of 500 Pa. When this happens, irreversible damage to the brain can occur, thus the biomaterial must have an elastic modulus less than or equal to brain tissue and a low tensile strength if an applied load is expected.\n\nParagraph 12: This rape experience creates some sort of turning point for the narrator, who decides after vomiting and crying that she has to use her brains to help her situation. She decides that she needs to \u201cfind a single wolf to keep away the pack\u201d and heads outside to find some higher ranked Russian to have an exclusive sexual relationship with so that she doesn't get viciously and spontaneously raped every day by different men. Out in the street she meets Anatol, a lieutenant from Ukraine. She flirts with him briefly and they agree to meet at her place at 7 pm. That night Petka arrives with some of his friends and makes himself at home. Petka and his friends shock the widow and the narrator as they place their food straight on the table, throw bones to the floor, and spit casually. Despite the narrator's worries that Petka and Anatol might clash over her, when Anatol comes he is at ease in her apartment and she discovers that his rank means very little to the Russians. Over the next days, Anatol comes to have sex with the narrator and a \"taboo\" is formed in that the Russians know that she is claimed. Anatol and his men come and go as they please and the widow's apartment is considered \"Anatol's men's restaurant\" but a restaurant where they bring the food. The narrator and the widow get food that the Russians bring and they benefit from the protection of Anatol's men against other Russian soldiers. The narrator also meets educated Russian soldiers, such as Andrei, and has many conversations about politics, fascism, and such. Petka shows up completely drunk in a fit of rage against the narrator and tries to hurt her but due to his drunkenness the widow and the narrator manage to push him out of the apartment. Among the many Russian visitors of the apartment, a pale blond lieutenant who has a lame leg and a clear dislike of the narrator rapes her one night, completely ignoring the \"taboo\" with Anatol. He arrives another day with a major and after conversing and drinking champagne; he asks the narrator if the major pleases her. The narrator realizes she has little choice considering Anatol has left and eventually decides to have sex with the major. She accepts the relationship with the major and does not call it rape since it is consensual. The major is very pleasant, shares his life with her, and brings her food and supplies such as candles.  The narrator contemplates her status as she agrees to have sexual relationships in return for goods and protection.\n\nParagraph 13: Twosret's highest known date is a Year 8 II Shemu day 29  hieratic inscription found on one of the foundation blocks (FB 2) of her mortuary temple at Gournah in 2011 by the University of Arizona Egyptian Expedition. Since this was only a foundation inscription and Twosret's temple, although never finished as planned, was at least partially completed, it is logical to assume that some time must have passed before her downfall and the termination of work on her temple project. Richard Wilkinson stressed that Twosret's mortuary temple was \"largely structurally completed,\" although bearing minimal decoration; therefore, she would have ruled for several more months beyond II Shemu 29 of her 8th Year for her temple to reach completion. Further study by Pearce Paul Creasman has concluded that the temple was \"functionally complete.\" She could, hence, have possibly ruled for 6 to 20 more months after the inscription date to achieve these levels of completion, thus starting her 9th regnal year around the interval of IV Akhet/I Peret\u2014when her husband died (since she assumed Siptah's reign as her own) or perhaps longer\u2014before Setnakhte's rule began. Or she could have had a nearly full 9th year reign, including the 6-year reign of Siptah.\n\nParagraph 14: The pointed digraph pasekh tsvey yudn can also be typed in different ways.

It was there when the Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, was fought, and remained until December 1, when it rejoined the Army of the Potomac, and passed the winter of 1864 and 1865 in doing siege duty in the trenches in front of Petersburg, Va. The Regiment was engaged in all the skirmishes that took place during this period, the most important of which were Hatcher's Run, December 10, 1864; Hatcher's Run, February 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, 1865; Fort Fisher, Va., March 25, and Fort Stedman, same day. In the attack on Petersburg, April 2, 1865, the Regiment took a prominent and important part.  The night before, the 6th Corps was massed in front of Fort Fisher, ready for the assault.  Just at daybreak, Sunday morning, the lines advanced under a heavy fire, and carried the enemy's main lines by storm.  The Second Rhode Island started in the second line, but were the first to reach the works, and planted its colors on the parapet.  The enemy fled in great confusion, after their lines were pierced.  Lieutenant Frank S. Halliday, acting Adjutant of the Regiment, with a small party, carried a rebel fort mounting two guns, and turned them upon the enemy.  The whole affair was a glorious success, and caused the evacuation of the city on Monday morning, April 3. In the Battle of Sailors' Creek, Thursday following the above, April 6, the Regiment displayed great prowess.  About 5 o'clock, P. M., the division to which it was attached, advanced on the enemy's lines, and the Second Rhode Island attacked a part of the Naval Brigade, commanded by officers of the late rebel fleet.  The Regiment charged to within a few feet of their lines, when it met a severe flank fire, which forced it to retire.  The action as so close that men were bayoneted, and knocked down with the butts of muskets.  In the confusion, the colors of the Regiment were captured, but were quickly retaken.  The place where it charged was swampy, with water at least three feet deep, but the men pushed gallantly forward, and regained all the ground lost, causing the enemy to flee in great confusion, who left a part of their wagons in Federal hands.  The loss was severe in officers and men, but there was a proud satisfaction in knowing that the efforts of the Regiment hastened the surrender of Lee and his army. Captain Charles W. Gleason and Lieutenant William H. Perry, both gallant officers, were killed.  They were loved and respected by the Regiment. They entered the service as enlisted men at the beginning of the war, and by merit rose to their positions as officers.  In this battle the conduct of officers and men was in the highest degree commendable. The new men, who went into action for the first time, fought-like veterans.\n\nParagraph 20: Twosret's highest known date is a Year 8 II Shemu day 29  hieratic inscription found on one of the foundation blocks (FB 2) of her mortuary temple at Gournah in 2011 by the University of Arizona Egyptian Expedition.

The series tells the story of a man (Nassar) whose wife died while giving birth because his mother had gone to the home of the noble family of Abu Hashem in the neighborhood to help Umm Hashem with the birth of her baby. When Abu Hashim heard about the birth of the male child, he promised God that he would go on foot to the pilgrimage when his son reaches the age of seven. The years pass and the child becomes seven years old and some of the inhabitants of the neighborhood prepare to go to the pilgrimage, including Nassar and his mother. Nassar who wants to propose to the daughter of Abu Hashim before going for Hajj, believes that her father delays the matter because he refuses Nassar. Nassar enters into a fight with the bakery workers when he intervenes to protect an orphan boy (Rida). He is put in jail for two days during which he is subjected to ill-treatment. On the 7th birthday of Hashim, his father holds a birthday party and invites the majority of the residents of the neighborhood to his home as well as the head of the police department (Yuzbashi Hilmi). When Nassar comes out of prison, he sets his sights on retaliation against the head of the police department. Nassar goes to the celebration where the chief of police is to be shot but the bullet hits Hashem in the chest. Nassar immediately escapes and meets with Sayyah, another wanted man. Sayyah and Nassar goes to the cemetery to hide and they become friends. Hashem is saved by his uncle the doctor. Pilgrims go on their long journey to Mecca as planned despite Hashem's injury. Nassar asks to meet Arafa in order to meet his mother. Karkar, an informer who works for the head of the police, hears that Arafa met Nassar while talking to his friend. Arafa is being detained and he is forced to tell the police station where Nassar is. The police go to the cemetery and heavy gunfire starts. Sayyah is killed but Arafa, who is wounded, and Nassar manage to flee. Nassar and Arafah will end up in an orchard. The events follow and Nassar is sentenced to death and Arafa to five years in prison after fabricating to Nassar a charge of trying to kill the Wali. Days after overnight in the open they come to a gentleman (Abu Jawad) who lives with his family in Douma. Because Nassar wants to meet his mother before going to Palestine. Jawad goes to Shaghour to bring Nassar's mother to Douma but Jawad is caught after suspicion. The trouble continues on Nassar and he begins to search after Jawad. Nassar kidnaps Karkar to testify about Jawad's place and confesses to him but he is killed when Karkar tries to kill the brother of Jawad. Nassar then burns the bakery to distract the police force while he enters the outpost to look for Jawad. He fails to find him  and releases some prisoners instead. Nassar and Arafa return to a cave they have stayed in. Some young men join them and it turns out that they are the ones who was released. Nassar seeks help from Talib who works for Abu Hashim in a perfume shop. Talib is asked to enter the prison of the Hakam Dar with the help of the private driver to the deputy governor (Hakam Dar).\n\nParagraph 23: This rape experience creates some sort of turning point for the narrator, who decides after vomiting and crying that she has to use her brains to help her situation.

It was there when the Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, was fought, and remained until December 1, when it rejoined the Army of the Potomac, and passed the winter of 1864 and 1865 in doing siege duty in the trenches in front of Petersburg, Va. The Regiment was engaged in all the skirmishes that took place during this period, the most important of which were Hatcher's Run, December 10, 1864; Hatcher's Run, February 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, 1865; Fort Fisher, Va., March 25, and Fort Stedman, same day. In the attack on Petersburg, April 2, 1865, the Regiment took a prominent and important part.  The night before, the 6th Corps was massed in front of Fort Fisher, ready for the assault.  Just at daybreak, Sunday morning, the lines advanced under a heavy fire, and carried the enemy's main lines by storm.  The Second Rhode Island started in the second line, but were the first to reach the works, and planted its colors on the parapet.  The enemy fled in great confusion, after their lines were pierced.  Lieutenant Frank S. Halliday, acting Adjutant of the Regiment, with a small party, carried a rebel fort mounting two guns, and turned them upon the enemy.  The whole affair was a glorious success, and caused the evacuation of the city on Monday morning, April 3. In the Battle of Sailors' Creek, Thursday following the above, April 6, the Regiment displayed great prowess.  About 5 o'clock, P. M., the division to which it was attached, advanced on the enemy's lines, and the Second Rhode Island attacked a part of the Naval Brigade, commanded by officers of the late rebel fleet.  The Regiment charged to within a few feet of their lines, when it met a severe flank fire, which forced it to retire.  The action as so close that men were bayoneted, and knocked down with the butts of muskets.  In the confusion, the colors of the Regiment were captured, but were quickly retaken.  The place where it charged was swampy, with water at least three feet deep, but the men pushed gallantly forward, and regained all the ground lost, causing the enemy to flee in great confusion, who left a part of their wagons in Federal hands.  The loss was severe in officers and men, but there was a proud satisfaction in knowing that the efforts of the Regiment hastened the surrender of Lee and his army. Captain Charles W. Gleason and Lieutenant William H. Perry, both gallant officers, were killed.  They were loved and respected by the Regiment. They entered the service as enlisted men at the beginning of the war, and by merit rose to their positions as officers.

The one is simply to enter a precomposed pasekh tsvey yudn, which is both displayed and stored as a single character \u05f2\u05b7 (U+FB1F). The second option is to enter the tsvey yudn ligature as a base character and then to enter a combining pasekh for display together with it. Although appearing to be a single character \u05f2\u05b7, it is stored digitally as two separate characters (U+05F2 U+05B7). These two forms can only be directly entered from a keyboard on which the ligature appears. As a result, a practice is developing where pasekh tsvey yudn are indicated by enclosing a pasekh between the elements of a two-character digraph. The pasekh aligns correctly only with the first yud (subject to conditions described in the next section) but the display is tolerably that of a fully marked digraph \u05d9\u05b7\u05d9 and in some display environments may be indistinguishable from one or both of the previous alternatives. However, this option requires the storage of three separate characters (U+05D9 U+05B7 U+05D9). As a fourth alternative, albeit the least stable typographically, the second of two consecutive yudn may be pointed \u05d9\u05d9\u05b7 (U+05D9 U+05D9 U+05B7). A pasekh yud is otherwise not part of any established Yiddish character repertoire, and its use in this context manifests conditions that are specific to computerized typography. The four possible representations of the pasekh tsvey yudn thus have even greater potential for causing confusion than do the other digraphs. A further potentially confusing option specific to computerized text production, but not a component of any Yiddish orthographic tradition, is the combination of a khirik with a tsvey yudn ligature to represent the consonant-vowel sequence yud \u2014 khirik yud, as \u05f2\u05b4 (U+05F2 U+05B4) rather than the correct \u05d9\u05d9\u05b4 (U+05D9 U+05D9 U+05B4).\n\nParagraph 5: The event in the series dates back to the late Ottoman rule of Syria (late 1890s\u2013early 1900s). The series tells the story of a man (Nassar) whose wife died while giving birth because his mother had gone to the home of the noble family of Abu Hashem in the neighborhood to help Umm Hashem with the birth of her baby. When Abu Hashim heard about the birth of the male child, he promised God that he would go on foot to the pilgrimage when his son reaches the age of seven. The years pass and the child becomes seven years old and some of the inhabitants of the neighborhood prepare to go to the pilgrimage, including Nassar and his mother. Nassar who wants to propose to the daughter of Abu Hashim before going for Hajj, believes that her father delays the matter because he refuses Nassar. Nassar enters into a fight with the bakery workers when he intervenes to protect an orphan boy (Rida). He is put in jail for two days during which he is subjected to ill-treatment. On the 7th birthday of Hashim, his father holds a birthday party and invites the majority of the residents of the neighborhood to his home as well as the head of the police department (Yuzbashi Hilmi). When Nassar comes out of prison, he sets his sights on retaliation against the head of the police department. Nassar goes to the celebration where the chief of police is to be shot but the bullet hits Hashem in the chest. Nassar immediately escapes and meets with Sayyah, another wanted man. Sayyah and Nassar goes to the cemetery to hide and they become friends. Hashem is saved by his uncle the doctor. Pilgrims go on their long journey to Mecca as planned despite Hashem's injury. Nassar asks to meet Arafa in order to meet his mother. Karkar, an informer who works for the head of the police, hears that Arafa met Nassar while talking to his friend. Arafa is being detained and he is forced to tell the police station where Nassar is. The police go to the cemetery and heavy gunfire starts. Sayyah is killed but Arafa, who is wounded, and Nassar manage to flee. Nassar and Arafah will end up in an orchard. The events follow and Nassar is sentenced to death and Arafa to five years in prison after fabricating to Nassar a charge of trying to kill the Wali. Days after overnight in the open they come to a gentleman (Abu Jawad) who lives with his family in Douma. Because Nassar wants to meet his mother before going to Palestine. Jawad goes to Shaghour to bring Nassar's mother to Douma but Jawad is caught after suspicion. The trouble continues on Nassar and he begins to search after Jawad. Nassar kidnaps Karkar to testify about Jawad's place and confesses to him but he is killed when Karkar tries to kill the brother of Jawad. Nassar then burns the bakery to distract the police force while he enters the outpost to look for Jawad. He fails to find him  and releases some prisoners instead. Nassar and Arafa return to a cave they have stayed in. Some young men join them and it turns out that they are the ones who was released. Nassar seeks help from Talib who works for Abu Hashim in a perfume shop. Talib is asked to enter the prison of the Hakam Dar with the help of the private driver to the deputy governor (Hakam Dar).\n\nParagraph 6: This rape experience creates some sort of turning point for the narrator, who decides after vomiting and crying that she has to use her brains to help her situation. She decides that she needs to \u201cfind a single wolf to keep away the pack\u201d and heads outside to find some higher ranked Russian to have an exclusive sexual relationship with so that she doesn't get viciously and spontaneously raped every day by different men. Out in the street she meets Anatol, a lieutenant from Ukraine. She flirts with him briefly and they agree to meet at her place at 7 pm. That night Petka arrives with some of his friends and makes himself at home. Petka and his friends shock the widow and the narrator as they place their food straight on the table, throw bones to the floor, and spit casually. Despite the narrator's worries that Petka and Anatol might clash over her, when Anatol comes he is at ease in her apartment and she discovers that his rank means very little to the Russians. Over the next days, Anatol comes to have sex with the narrator and a \"taboo\" is formed in that the Russians know that she is claimed. Anatol and his men come and go as they please and the widow's apartment is considered \"Anatol's men's restaurant\" but a restaurant where they bring the food. The narrator and the widow get food that the Russians bring and they benefit from the protection of Anatol's men against other Russian soldiers. The narrator also meets educated Russian soldiers, such as Andrei, and has many conversations about politics, fascism, and such. Petka shows up completely drunk in a fit of rage against the narrator and tries to hurt her but due to his drunkenness the widow and the narrator manage to push him out of the apartment. Among the many Russian visitors of the apartment, a pale blond lieutenant who has a lame leg and a clear dislike of the narrator rapes her one night, completely ignoring the \"taboo\" with Anatol. He arrives another day with a major and after conversing and drinking champagne; he asks the narrator if the major pleases her. The narrator realizes she has little choice considering Anatol has left and eventually decides to have sex with the major. She accepts the relationship with the major and does not call it rape since it is consensual. The major is very pleasant, shares his life with her, and brings her food and supplies such as candles.  The narrator contemplates her status as she agrees to have sexual relationships in return for goods and protection.\n\nParagraph 7: After this battle the Regiment was detailed as part of the garrison of Winchester, to protect it against guerrillas, as well as to escort trains to the front.

Practice pads may be designed to approximate the tension and response of a true drumhead when struck, or to provide less rebound to train the percussionist\u2019s muscles. They can be constructed in a variety of shapes and sizes, and are typically small and light enough to be easily portable. Many variations include harder or softer playing surfaces, non-skid bases (that can also double as muted playing surfaces), and fixing points allowing the pad to be connected to existing percussion hardware such as a cymbal or snare drum stand.\n\nParagraph 9: Kaduthuruthy St. Mary is known as Kaduthuruthy Muthiyamma (\u0d15\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d41\u0d30\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f \u0d2e\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e). Kaduthuruthy Valiapally is one of the churches where Virgin Mary appeared in front of the devotees as an old woman (\u0d2e\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e). Southists of Kaduthuruthy had been considering Virgin Mary is the patron of their church for the remembrance of their first set of churches in Kodungallur. According to Bishop Francis Roz in his report to Serra (1603/1604), says that he has read from a Chaldean book that there were 3 churches in Cranganore built by the Thomman Keenan and his descendants. Southist Christians of the Syriac Rite built 3 churches in Kodungallur immediately after they had been given permission to settle down in Kodungallur by the Chera King. They are in the Name of Virgin Mary, St. Thomas and St. Kuriakose. The old wooden buildings constructed for the first 3 churches are said to have last for four hundred years. First church building in Kaduthuruthy in the name of Virgin Mary (\u0d15\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e) had constructed from wooden logs in a square shape and known as Square Church. Those churches in Kodungallur constructed by Thomman Keenan and his companions were completely destroyed later, as a result of a continuous clash between the neighbouring kings.  But the church built in the name of St. Thomas had undergone many relocations and renovation, helped this church to survive until the 15th century and had reconstructed by Portuguese after the destruction of Cranganore. According to Mar Jacob Abuna (1533), Dionysio (1578), Bishop Francis Roz (1604) on their report says that the church which stood in Cranganore had been there from the third century and was built by Thomas of Cana. It is the Syriac liturgical tradition of Southists to being faithful to the Virgin Mary,  resulted them to accept Virgin Mary as the patron of the church built in Kaduthuruthy in fourth century. The same tradition is practiced in their other ancient churches like Udayamperoor, Mulanthuruthy, Kottayam Chungam and Kallissery. Later Southist community lost the control over the church in Mulanthuruthy and Udayamperoor. Their seamless faith is accounted by Virgin Mary and she revealed herself as an old woman in front of the devotees. This miraculous appearance of Virgin Mary happened in AD 1596, during the erection of the historic granite cross of Kaduthuruthy Vallyapalli. The sculpture and carving work of the Cross from a single stone block had completed with a total height of 50 feet in AD 1596. It is believed that the iconic Kaduthuruthy Vallyapalli Cross is the highest open air cross in Asia, made out from a single block. Being monolithic in its shape, which in fact proclaiming the glory of Kaduthuruthy Valiapally and the Southists of Kaduthuruthy. As it is gigantic in structure, it was very difficult to upright the cross and to position in the courtyard of the Vallyapalli. During that time when they faced difficulty to upright the cross, Virgin Mary-the patron of the Kaduthuruthy Valiapally revealed herself as an old woman (Muthiyamma) and helped them to upright the cross miraculously by supporting the cross by her hand. Kaduthuruthy Valiapally is one of the churches blessed by Virgin Mary by appearing in front of the devotees as an old woman. There after the Blessed Virgin Mary residing in Kaduthuruthy Valiapally known as Kaduthuruthy Muthiyamma. Bishop Alexis Dom Menesis had carried out the inaugural blessing of the Cross situated on the courtyard of this Church, during the Holy Friday of 1599.\n\nParagraph 10: A variety of practice pads have been developed to assist percussionists in different ways. Practice pads may be designed to approximate the tension and response of a true drumhead when struck, or to provide less rebound to train the percussionist\u2019s muscles. They can be constructed in a variety of shapes and sizes, and are typically small and light enough to be easily portable. Many variations include harder or softer playing surfaces, non-skid bases (that can also double as muted playing surfaces), and fixing points allowing the pad to be connected to existing percussion hardware such as a cymbal or snare drum stand.\n\nParagraph 11: In addition to a material being certified as biocompatible, biomaterials must be engineered specifically to their target application within a medical device. This is especially important in terms of mechanical properties which govern the way that a given biomaterial behaves. One of the most relevant material parameters is the Young's Modulus, E, which describes a material's elastic response to stresses. The Young's Moduli of the tissue and the device that is being coupled to it must closely match for optimal compatibility between device and body, whether the device is implanted or mounted externally. Matching the elastic modulus makes it possible to limit movement and delamination at the biointerface between implant and tissue as well as avoiding stress concentration that can lead to mechanical failure. Other important properties are the tensile and compressive strengths which quantify the maximum stresses a material can withstand before breaking and may be used to set stress limits that a device may be subject to within or external to the body. Depending on the application, it may be desirable for a biomaterial to have high strength so that it is resistant to failure when subjected to a load, however in other applications it may be beneficial for the material to be low strength. There is a careful balance between strength and stiffness that determines how robust to failure the biomaterial device is. Typically, as the elasticity of the biomaterial increases, the ultimate tensile strength will decrease and vice versa. One application where a high-strength material is undesired is in neural probes; if a high-strength material is used in these applications the tissue will always fail before the device does (under applied load) because the Young's Modulus of the dura mater and cerebral tissue is on the order of 500 Pa. When this happens, irreversible damage to the brain can occur, thus the biomaterial must have an elastic modulus less than or equal to brain tissue and a low tensile strength if an applied load is expected.\n\nParagraph 12: This rape experience creates some sort of turning point for the narrator, who decides after vomiting and crying that she has to use her brains to help her situation.

This is especially important in terms of mechanical properties which govern the way that a given biomaterial behaves. One of the most relevant material parameters is the Young's Modulus, E, which describes a material's elastic response to stresses. The Young's Moduli of the tissue and the device that is being coupled to it must closely match for optimal compatibility between device and body, whether the device is implanted or mounted externally. Matching the elastic modulus makes it possible to limit movement and delamination at the biointerface between implant and tissue as well as avoiding stress concentration that can lead to mechanical failure. Other important properties are the tensile and compressive strengths which quantify the maximum stresses a material can withstand before breaking and may be used to set stress limits that a device may be subject to within or external to the body. Depending on the application, it may be desirable for a biomaterial to have high strength so that it is resistant to failure when subjected to a load, however in other applications it may be beneficial for the material to be low strength. There is a careful balance between strength and stiffness that determines how robust to failure the biomaterial device is. Typically, as the elasticity of the biomaterial increases, the ultimate tensile strength will decrease and vice versa. One application where a high-strength material is undesired is in neural probes; if a high-strength material is used in these applications the tissue will always fail before the device does (under applied load) because the Young's Modulus of the dura mater and cerebral tissue is on the order of 500 Pa. When this happens, irreversible damage to the brain can occur, thus the biomaterial must have an elastic modulus less than or equal to brain tissue and a low tensile strength if an applied load is expected.\n\nParagraph 16: Twosret's highest known date is a Year 8 II Shemu day 29  hieratic inscription found on one of the foundation blocks (FB 2) of her mortuary temple at Gournah in 2011 by the University of Arizona Egyptian Expedition.

Practice pads may be designed to approximate the tension and response of a true drumhead when struck, or to provide less rebound to train the percussionist\u2019s muscles. They can be constructed in a variety of shapes and sizes, and are typically small and light enough to be easily portable. Many variations include harder or softer playing surfaces, non-skid bases (that can also double as muted playing surfaces), and fixing points allowing the pad to be connected to existing percussion hardware such as a cymbal or snare drum stand.\n\nParagraph 18: In addition to a material being certified as biocompatible, biomaterials must be engineered specifically to their target application within a medical device.

It was there when the Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, was fought, and remained until December 1, when it rejoined the Army of the Potomac, and passed the winter of 1864 and 1865 in doing siege duty in the trenches in front of Petersburg, Va. The Regiment was engaged in all the skirmishes that took place during this period, the most important of which were Hatcher's Run, December 10, 1864; Hatcher's Run, February 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, 1865; Fort Fisher, Va., March 25, and Fort Stedman, same day. In the attack on Petersburg, April 2, 1865, the Regiment took a prominent and important part.  The night before, the 6th Corps was massed in front of Fort Fisher, ready for the assault.  Just at daybreak, Sunday morning, the lines advanced under a heavy fire, and carried the enemy's main lines by storm.  The Second Rhode Island started in the second line, but were the first to reach the works, and planted its colors on the parapet.  The enemy fled in great confusion, after their lines were pierced.  Lieutenant Frank S. Halliday, acting Adjutant of the Regiment, with a small party, carried a rebel fort mounting two guns, and turned them upon the enemy.  The whole affair was a glorious success, and caused the evacuation of the city on Monday morning, April 3. In the Battle of Sailors' Creek, Thursday following the above, April 6, the Regiment displayed great prowess.  About 5 o'clock, P. M., the division to which it was attached, advanced on the enemy's lines, and the Second Rhode Island attacked a part of the Naval Brigade, commanded by officers of the late rebel fleet.  The Regiment charged to within a few feet of their lines, when it met a severe flank fire, which forced it to retire.  The action as so close that men were bayoneted, and knocked down with the butts of muskets.  In the confusion, the colors of the Regiment were captured, but were quickly retaken.  The place where it charged was swampy, with water at least three feet deep, but the men pushed gallantly forward, and regained all the ground lost, causing the enemy to flee in great confusion, who left a part of their wagons in Federal hands.  The loss was severe in officers and men, but there was a proud satisfaction in knowing that the efforts of the Regiment hastened the surrender of Lee and his army. Captain Charles W. Gleason and Lieutenant William H. Perry, both gallant officers, were killed.  They were loved and respected by the Regiment. They entered the service as enlisted men at the beginning of the war, and by merit rose to their positions as officers.  In this battle the conduct of officers and men was in the highest degree commendable. The new men, who went into action for the first time, fought-like veterans.\n\nParagraph 20: Twosret's highest known date is a Year 8 II Shemu day 29  hieratic inscription found on one of the foundation blocks (FB 2) of her mortuary temple at Gournah in 2011 by the University of Arizona Egyptian Expedition.

The series tells the story of a man (Nassar) whose wife died while giving birth because his mother had gone to the home of the noble family of Abu Hashem in the neighborhood to help Umm Hashem with the birth of her baby. When Abu Hashim heard about the birth of the male child, he promised God that he would go on foot to the pilgrimage when his son reaches the age of seven. The years pass and the child becomes seven years old and some of the inhabitants of the neighborhood prepare to go to the pilgrimage, including Nassar and his mother. Nassar who wants to propose to the daughter of Abu Hashim before going for Hajj, believes that her father delays the matter because he refuses Nassar. Nassar enters into a fight with the bakery workers when he intervenes to protect an orphan boy (Rida). He is put in jail for two days during which he is subjected to ill-treatment. On the 7th birthday of Hashim, his father holds a birthday party and invites the majority of the residents of the neighborhood to his home as well as the head of the police department (Yuzbashi Hilmi). When Nassar comes out of prison, he sets his sights on retaliation against the head of the police department. Nassar goes to the celebration where the chief of police is to be shot but the bullet hits Hashem in the chest. Nassar immediately escapes and meets with Sayyah, another wanted man. Sayyah and Nassar goes to the cemetery to hide and they become friends. Hashem is saved by his uncle the doctor. Pilgrims go on their long journey to Mecca as planned despite Hashem's injury. Nassar asks to meet Arafa in order to meet his mother. Karkar, an informer who works for the head of the police, hears that Arafa met Nassar while talking to his friend. Arafa is being detained and he is forced to tell the police station where Nassar is. The police go to the cemetery and heavy gunfire starts. Sayyah is killed but Arafa, who is wounded, and Nassar manage to flee. Nassar and Arafah will end up in an orchard. The events follow and Nassar is sentenced to death and Arafa to five years in prison after fabricating to Nassar a charge of trying to kill the Wali. Days after overnight in the open they come to a gentleman (Abu Jawad) who lives with his family in Douma. Because Nassar wants to meet his mother before going to Palestine. Jawad goes to Shaghour to bring Nassar's mother to Douma but Jawad is caught after suspicion. The trouble continues on Nassar and he begins to search after Jawad. Nassar kidnaps Karkar to testify about Jawad's place and confesses to him but he is killed when Karkar tries to kill the brother of Jawad. Nassar then burns the bakery to distract the police force while he enters the outpost to look for Jawad. He fails to find him  and releases some prisoners instead. Nassar and Arafa return to a cave they have stayed in. Some young men join them and it turns out that they are the ones who was released. Nassar seeks help from Talib who works for Abu Hashim in a perfume shop. Talib is asked to enter the prison of the Hakam Dar with the help of the private driver to the deputy governor (Hakam Dar).\n\nParagraph 23: This rape experience creates some sort of turning point for the narrator, who decides after vomiting and crying that she has to use her brains to help her situation. She decides that she needs to \u201cfind a single wolf to keep away the pack\u201d and heads outside to find some higher ranked Russian to have an exclusive sexual relationship with so that she doesn't get viciously and spontaneously raped every day by different men. Out in the street she meets Anatol, a lieutenant from Ukraine. She flirts with him briefly and they agree to meet at her place at 7 pm. That night Petka arrives with some of his friends and makes himself at home. Petka and his friends shock the widow and the narrator as they place their food straight on the table, throw bones to the floor, and spit casually. Despite the narrator's worries that Petka and Anatol might clash over her, when Anatol comes he is at ease in her apartment and she discovers that his rank means very little to the Russians. Over the next days, Anatol comes to have sex with the narrator and a \"taboo\" is formed in that the Russians know that she is claimed. Anatol and his men come and go as they please and the widow's apartment is considered \"Anatol's men's restaurant\" but a restaurant where they bring the food. The narrator and the widow get food that the Russians bring and they benefit from the protection of Anatol's men against other Russian soldiers. The narrator also meets educated Russian soldiers, such as Andrei, and has many conversations about politics, fascism, and such. Petka shows up completely drunk in a fit of rage against the narrator and tries to hurt her but due to his drunkenness the widow and the narrator manage to push him out of the apartment. Among the many Russian visitors of the apartment, a pale blond lieutenant who has a lame leg and a clear dislike of the narrator rapes her one night, completely ignoring the \"taboo\" with Anatol. He arrives another day with a major and after conversing and drinking champagne; he asks the narrator if the major pleases her. The narrator realizes she has little choice considering Anatol has left and eventually decides to have sex with the major. She accepts the relationship with the major and does not call it rape since it is consensual. The major is very pleasant, shares his life with her, and brings her food and supplies such as candles.  The narrator contemplates her status as she agrees to have sexual relationships in return for goods and protection.\n\nParagraph 24: On April 29, 2011, Ali Haddad was appointed Mouldi A\u00efssaoui as General Director of USM Alger.

At the same time their outgoing neighbour, Rodaina(Suha Najjar), is trying to marry Monaliza off to her sleazy, older and still unwed brother, Suhail(Haidar Kfouf). Monaliza, fed up by Afaf constantly controlling her life, She tricks her into thinking that she is actually considering the proposal. In the office Monaliza meets Nayfeh (Nadera Omran), a bossy, prejudiced, disagreeable woman who keeps picking on everybody around and especially Hamdi (Shady Khalaf), the cheerful Egyptian cafeteria guy, who keeps trying to loosen her up with his coffee and jokes. Monaliza who's been living in an emotional ice cube for a long time, gradually opens up to Hamdi's charm and little by little lets him into her closed world and start to learn the joy of living. When Hamdi finally manages to draw a smile on Monaliza's face, things start getting complicated; Hamdi's work permit is expiring and he'll soon become \u201cillegal\u201d. On the other hand, Monaliza's trick backfires and suddenly everyone in the neighbourhood think that she is officially engaged to Suhail. Being socially inexperienced, and not wanting to lose the battle with Afaf, Monaliza doesn't know what to do about that neither she tells Hamdi about it. Until one day, after a big fight with Nayfeh in the office, Hamdi impulsively decided to show up at Monaliza's neighbourhood to meet her sister and propose, only to hear that Monaliza is already \u201cengaged\u201d to the grocer, Suhail. Feeling shocked and betrayed, Hamdi decides to go back to Egypt immediately and Monaliza thinks she must have lost him forever. But when Rodaina realizes the heartbreak, being a dedicated lover, she encourages Monaliza to run after him and work things out. Monaliza's story overlaps with a bunch of other characters\u2019 who surround her; the story of her sister Afaf and what brought her to become agoraphobic, and the story of Rodaina, who is still waiting for her husband who disappeared in Iraq several years ago, and the story of Nayfeh at the office and her inexcusable bitterness.\n\nParagraph 3: Following Will's arrival in Bel-Air, he was a great distance from home and was considered an outsider by many people in his Bel-Air neighborhood. Early on, he had a picture of Malcolm X on his wall. He often disagrees with his cousin Carlton, whom he sees as not quite \"black\" enough because he doesn't talk like other young African Americans. The next day at school, Carlton and Will show up and after failing to talk the bully down and scare her, they bribe her to leave Ashley alone for $50. Will becomes sick with an infection and must have his tonsils removed. At the hospital, Will befriend his roommate, an elderly patient named Max Jakey who has an optimistic and care-free attitude despite being cooped up in a hospital all the time. After suffering from nightmares about incompetent doctors, Will escapes and goes back home but is busted by Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv when Phil sits on top of Geoffrey's bed. Will is taken back to the hospital (complete with a bodyguard to prevent his escape) and has his surgery. Max later returns to retrieve his lucky hat, having been moved to Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Talking to Will and seeing a nurse come in, he gives Will his lucky hat to keep. While Smith sometimes perceives Phil as being overprotective of Ashley, he himself also can be; when Ashley asks him about sex, Will became shocked by Ashley's inquiry, which leads him and Carlton to go to a clinic to talk to a doctor about how to discuss sex with Ashley. Will and Carlton are punished for their behavior and ordered by Uncle Phil to get the bracelet back. At the pawn shop, Agnes is about to sell the bracelet to another customer for $550. Playing on the crush Agnes has on Carlton, he plans to have Carlton strip to get the bracelet. His father, Lou, who had abandoned him at childhood, returns in the episode \"Papa's Got A Brand New Excuse.\" His dad promises to take him on the road with him, but later drops Will, and the resulting disappointment breaks Will\u2019s heart. It is then that Smith tearfully realizes Philip is the closest thing he had to a father. Will and the Banks family vacation to Will's hometown in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where Will learns to his horror that he has a reputation as a chicken due to not fighting Omar, a local bully and instead going to live in Bel Air, Los Angeles. To salvage his reputation, Will plans to fight Omar on the basketball court where he had the notorious fight but finds that Omar is no longer a bully and has grown up, attempting to give back to his community and help people. Will refuses to take no for an answer and keeps trying to fight Omar, who reminds Will that he needs to grow up and stop worrying about his reputation. Will chooses to stay home an extra week with Vy but later calls Uncle Phil to tell him that he's not coming back. \n\nParagraph 4: Throughout the nineteenth century, the institution became known because of the efforts of missionaries serving throughout the world. In the 1870s, the campus was expanded with the construction of two buildings\u2014one housing a gymnasium and additional lecture space; the second, a library. The seminary desired to build a library first, citing the need to house its expanding collection of books. However, local businessman and seminary benefactor James Suydam donated funds to build the gymnasium, to be named Suydam Hall, because he was extremely concerned with student health. Suydam Hall was built in 1873 and was designed by architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh. Hardenbergh had finished completing the design for Kirkpatrick Chapel and Geology Hall on the Rutgers campus and later would become known for buildings in New York City, including the Plaza Hotel and Dakota Apartments. After receiving a donation from Gardner A. Sage earmarked for the construction of a library, the trustees commissioned Hardenbergh's former teacher, German-American architect Detlef Lienau, to design it. The Sage Library was completed in 1875.  Lienau designed the library to complement Hardenbergh's (style) design for Suydam Hall. In the 1960s, Suydam Hall and Hertzog Hall were deemed to be inadequate for the administrative and instructional needs of the seminary. The trustees voted in 1966 to demolish both buildings and replace it with a modern one-story all-purpose building, Zwemer Hall, containing the seminary's chapel, faculty offices, and classroom facilities.\n\nParagraph 5: When Monaliza Smiled is a romantic comedy film that takes place in Amman, Jordan and tells the story of Monaliza (Tahani Salim) who was named after a postcard of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. In contrast to the \u201cinteresting\u201d story behind her name, Monaliza lived an unpleasant upbringing, which made her grow her anti-social attitude and most importantly an extreme inability to draw a smile. Now, 37 years old, and after 17 years of waiting for her turn to come in the long queue of applicants, Monaliza finally gets a governmental job at the Directorate of Archiving and makes a decision that it's time for her to go out into the world. This makes Afaf (Haifa Al Agha), her older unmarried agoraphobic sister who wants to keep Monaliza by her side, very unhappy.

Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy emerged as the most important in the Middle East and the wider Arab world. Finding themselves as mere figureheads during the period of British control, Egypt and Sudan's monarchs saw their powers increased following the recognition of independence, and the subsequent adoption of the 1923 Constitution, the most liberal in the country's history. Although King Fuad I often ruled as an autocrat, partly because he repeatedly overrode some provisions of the Constitution, Egypt and Sudan had the freest parliament in the region. During Fuad's reign and that of his son, Farouk, the country witnessed six free parliamentary elections and enjoyed a free press as well as an independent judiciary. According to historian Philip Mansel, \"the Egyptian monarchy appeared so splendid, powerful and popular that King Farouk's ignominious end seems inexplicable.\" The Muhammad Ali Dynasty's downfall is often regarded as having begun with the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which greatly discredited the King. It accelerated with the growing discontent of Egypt's armed forces following the country's defeat in the First Arab-Israeli War. Disgruntled members of the military formed the Free Officers Movement, which led a coup d'\u00e9tat on 23 July 1952, thereby marking the beginning of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The toppling of the monarchy, and the resultant establishment of a revolutionary republican government, was the first of its kind in the modern Arab world, and was a crucial event in the region's history; it accelerated dramatically the rise of Pan-Arabism, and had a domino effect leading to similar military overthrows of the monarchies of Iraq (1958), North Yemen (1962), and Libya (1969). Egypt has had a republican form of government since the end of monarchical rule. Although the establishment of genuine democratic rule was one of the six core principles of the Revolution, political parties were banned in 1953 and the country was turned into a military dictatorship. The thriving pluralism that characterized political life during the latter period of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule was thus brought to an end. Even though a multi-party system was officially restored in Egypt in 1976, the country has never recovered the level of political freedom it had enjoyed during the monarchy. In common with most deposed royal families, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty was initially vilified by the new revolutionary regime. Nonetheless, it has undergone re-evaluation in recent years; nostalgia for the former monarchy has been growing among some in Egypt, largely fuelled by the airing in 2007 of a hugely successful serial about the life of King Farouk I.\n\nParagraph 7: Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, White debuted in her family's circus show at age 2, acting as a \"living doll\" who stood in place until she got a cue to begin cooing and wriggling. At the age of 10, she was dancing in vaudeville as part of The White Sisters, leading to jobs with the Ziegfeld Follies and Earl Carroll revue, then moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s. Her first film was A Night in a Dormitory (1930) co-starring Ginger Rogers. This job led to a number of short films at Path\u00e9 Exchange (later RKO Pictures), where she played leading lady to familiar comics, such as Edgar Kennedy and Leon Errol.\n\nParagraph 8: \"Confide in Me\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Sean Smith labelled the track a \"classic\" to Minogue's discography, as similar to how William Baker viewed it. Larry Flick from Billboard complimented \"the gorgeously atmospheric, downtempo album cut\". Nick Levine from Digital Spy selected it as the standout, and commented \"How can we plump for anything other than 'Confide in Me'? Fifteen years on, this sumptuous, string-swathed dance-pop epic still caresses the ears like a flirty hair stylist.\" Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian noted that it \"has a classical violin overture that unfolds into a snake-charming Eastern melody. Kylie sounds delightfully woebegone.\" Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that \"the Brothers In Rhythm-produced gem was the stepping stone that took her from the glorious pop of \"Better The Devil You Know\" to collaborating with Nick Cave on \"Where The Wild Roses Grow\".\" He added that it was \"a vehicle to showcase a then-hugely-underrated voice.\" Music writer James Masterton deemed it a \"exotic, string-laden single\". Alan Jones from Music Week gave it five out of five, noting that \"a widescreen string-driven shuffle which allows her to deliver a soft and polished vocal.\" Tim Jeffery from the magazine's RM Dance Update said, \"Very Madonna-ish, in fact, even down to the giggly chuckle thrown in occasionally. Huge.\" Another editor, James Hamilton deemed it a \"Madonna-ishly moaned and muttered Brothers In Rhythm creation\". Quentin Harrison from PopMatters highlighted the track from the parent album, and said \"Minogue's international perspective lent her canvas precision, not iciness as witnessed with 'Confide in Me'. The cut played like a lost spy film accompaniment, its grandiose strings and rumbling groove enthralled. 'Confide in Me' let Minogue become the vocalist cynics sneered she'd never be\u00a0...\". British author and critic Adrian Denning enjoyed the track and called it \"truly timeless and absolutely wonderful.\" He declared the track \"Arguably still her finest musical moment to this date,\" and found the production and lyrical delivery \"classy\". Billboards Jason Lipshutz wrote of the track:\n\nParagraph 9: The process of running rounds in the 1500 tends to select strategic experts because nobody would want to run hard three times in four days as this schedule would require.  Since 2008 (excepting that bad race at the 2012 Olympics), the expert in this has been two-time defending champion Asbel Kiprop.  But in case anybody wanted to run fast, Kiprop also left a message at the fastest race of the year in Monaco, where he blew away many of the members of this field by almost 2 seconds in his near miss of the world record.  What makes Kiprop so dangerous is his ability to accelerate from the back of the field and in the final that is exactly where he went.  Was he hiding or just waiting to pounce?  With three other Kenyan teammates making it to the final, there was talk about a potential sweep.  Timothy Cheruiyot and Elijah Motonei Manangoi took the race through an honest first two laps in 1:58.62.  Only Aman Wote ran aggressively with them at the front, the other tacticians lining themselves up for the finish.  Matthew Centrowitz, Jr. was the first to move forward as they came through for the bell.  With 300 metres to go, Olympic champion Taoufik Makhloufi made his move, identical to the Olympics, Kiprop near the back of the pack beating only two Americans and boxed by Wote.  Over the next 100 metres, Makhloufi opened a lead chase by Abdalaati Iguider.  Kiprop slowed down to get out of the box, then ran around Wote out to lane 3.  The tall Kenyan was now clearly moving faster than the rest of the field he was passing on the outside.  As Kiprop swept past the field after the North African duo, only Silas Kiplagat came with him, these four breaking from the rest.  As Kiprop caught Iguider, he reacted and ran even with Kiprop up to Makhloufi.  With 50 metres to go, it was three abreast across the track with Kiplagat chasing Kiprop on the outside less than two metres back.  Kiprop broke past the two North Africans and ran on to victory, while Iguider edged ahead of a spent Makhloufi.  Out of nowhere (actually a distant fifth place) came sprinting Manangoi, faster than any of the leaders, drifting out to lane 3 for clear sailing.  Passing three people in the last 10 metres, Manangoi crossed the finish line just ahead of a desperately diving Iguider to take silver, Iguider doing a full face plant to the track across the finish line holding on to bronze.\n\nParagraph 10: Restoration work began on the monastery after 1860, starting with the southern fa\u00e7ade under supervision of the architect Rafael Silva e Castro, and in 1898 under Domingos Parente da Silva. Although the cloister cistern, internal clerical cells and the kitchen were demolished at this time, three reconstruction projects proposed by architect J. Colson, including the introduction of revivalist neo-Manueline elements, failed to gain the required approval. In 1863, architect Valentim Jos\u00e9 Correia was hired by the ombudsman of the Casa Pia, Eug\u00e9nio de Almeida, to reorganise the second storey of the old dormitory and design the windows (1863\u20131865). He was subsequently replaced by Samuel Barret, who constructed the towers in the extreme western end of the dormitories. Similarly and inexplicably, Barret was replaced by the Italian scenery designers Rambois and Cinatti, who had worked on the design of the S\u00e3o Carlos Theatre, to continue the remodelling within the monastery in 1867. Between 1867 and 1868, they profoundly altered the annex and fa\u00e7ade of the Church, which then appeared as it does today. They demolished the gallery and Hall of the Kings, constructed the towers of the eastern dormitory, the rose window of the upper choir and substituted the pyramid-shaped roof of the bell tower with the mitre-shaped design. The remodelling was delayed by the 1878 collapse of the central dormitory. After 1884, Raymundo Valladas began to contribute, initiating in 1886 the restoration of the cloister and the Sala do Cap\u00edtulo, including construction of the vaulted ceiling. The tomb of Alexandre Herculano, designed by Eduardo Augusto da Silva, was placed in the Sala do Cap\u00edtulo in 1888.\n\nParagraph 11: \"Confide in Me\" received critical acclaim from music critics.

This large temple complex comprises the main temple of Baba Baidyanath, where the Jyotirlinga is installed, along with twenty-one other temples. This temple is also one of fifty one Shaktipeeth of Goddess Durga where It is believed that the heart of Sati fell at Baidyanath Dham when Lord Vishnu used the Sudarshana Chakra, to cut Sati's corpse in order to stop Shiva's destruction. Here the deity is worshiped in form of Jaya Durga. The temple is mentioned in several ancient scriptures and continues to be mentioned even in modern-day history books. The story of the origin of this Jyotirlinga goes back to the Treta Yuga, in the era of Lord Rama. According to popular Hindu beliefs, Ravana The King of Lanka Once felt that his capital would be incomplete and under the constant threat of enemies unless Lord Shiva decides to stay there forever. So, he went to the Himalayas to impress the Lord and started offering his heads one after another. When he was about to cut off his tenth head, Lord Shiva descended on Earth impressed by his devotee. He then cured the wounded Ravana and granted him a boon. Ravana requested Lord Shiva to allow him to take the Shivalinga back to Lanka with him to which the Lord agreed but on one condition. Lord Shiva warned Ravana that he cannot keep the Shivalinga on the ground until he reaches Lanka and if he does so it will get fixed to the ground and he will never be able to uproot it. Ravana agreed to the condition and began his journey. All the other God and Goddess were not happy with the decision because they knew, if Shiva went to Lanka with Ravana, then he would become invincible and his evil deeds would threaten the world. They met Lord Vishnu and asked him to stop Ravana, the demon king from taking the Shivalinga to Lanka. Lord Vishnu asked Lord Varun, the Ocean God to enter the stomach of Ravana at the time he performs Aachamanam during the Sandhya Vandana, the evening prayer. Aachamanam is a process of purifying by sipping drops of water while reciting the 21 names of Vishnu. When Ravana reached Deoghar, it was almost evening so he decided to perform his evening prayers. As asked, Lord Varun entered his stomach during the Aachamanam and Ravana felt an urgent need to release himself. He gave the Shivalinga to a milkman and asked him to take care of the lingam until he comes back. To utter surprise, the more Ravana released himself, the more he felt the urge. He took a long time to come back and the impatient milkman kept the shiva linga on the ground and went away. When Ravana finally returned he saw that the Shivalinga was fixed on the ground. He tried a lot to uproot it but failed miserably. Ravana damaged the Shivalinga in the process. He understood that the milkman was Lord Vishnu who pranked him and left the place in anger. Later, God and Goddess came down from heaven and established the Shivalinga. Every monsoon (in the month of Shravan) millions of devotees undertake a rigorous  pilgrimage on foot from Ajgaibinath, Sultanganj to offer holy water and prayers to Baba Baidyanath. The pilgrimage is deemed complete with homage paid at Basukinath which is almost  from Deoghar.\n\nParagraph 14:  Baidyanath Dham Temple: Baidyanath Jyotirlinga temple, also commonly referred to as the Baidyanath Dham, is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga in India and is considered to be the most sacred abodes of Lord Shiva.The temple is located in Deoghar in the Santhal Parganas division of the state of Jharkhand in India.

Other religious buildings constructed in the region include the hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Necessidades, which was constructed in 1830; the Hermitage of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, along Canada do Bago, concluded in the second-half of the 17th century; the Hermitage of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, raised during the middle of the 17th century; and the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora do P\u00f3pulo, founded by Jacques de Padron.\n\nParagraph 16: Restoration work began on the monastery after 1860, starting with the southern fa\u00e7ade under supervision of the architect Rafael Silva e Castro, and in 1898 under Domingos Parente da Silva.

The trustees voted in 1966 to demolish both buildings and replace it with a modern one-story all-purpose building, Zwemer Hall, containing the seminary's chapel, faculty offices, and classroom facilities.\n\nParagraph 18: Rulers of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty governed Egypt and Sudan as absolute monarchs until constitutional rule was established in August 1878. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy emerged as the most important in the Middle East and the wider Arab world. Finding themselves as mere figureheads during the period of British control, Egypt and Sudan's monarchs saw their powers increased following the recognition of independence, and the subsequent adoption of the 1923 Constitution, the most liberal in the country's history. Although King Fuad I often ruled as an autocrat, partly because he repeatedly overrode some provisions of the Constitution, Egypt and Sudan had the freest parliament in the region. During Fuad's reign and that of his son, Farouk, the country witnessed six free parliamentary elections and enjoyed a free press as well as an independent judiciary. According to historian Philip Mansel, \"the Egyptian monarchy appeared so splendid, powerful and popular that King Farouk's ignominious end seems inexplicable.\" The Muhammad Ali Dynasty's downfall is often regarded as having begun with the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which greatly discredited the King. It accelerated with the growing discontent of Egypt's armed forces following the country's defeat in the First Arab-Israeli War. Disgruntled members of the military formed the Free Officers Movement, which led a coup d'\u00e9tat on 23 July 1952, thereby marking the beginning of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The toppling of the monarchy, and the resultant establishment of a revolutionary republican government, was the first of its kind in the modern Arab world, and was a crucial event in the region's history; it accelerated dramatically the rise of Pan-Arabism, and had a domino effect leading to similar military overthrows of the monarchies of Iraq (1958), North Yemen (1962), and Libya (1969). Egypt has had a republican form of government since the end of monarchical rule. Although the establishment of genuine democratic rule was one of the six core principles of the Revolution, political parties were banned in 1953 and the country was turned into a military dictatorship. The thriving pluralism that characterized political life during the latter period of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule was thus brought to an end. Even though a multi-party system was officially restored in Egypt in 1976, the country has never recovered the level of political freedom it had enjoyed during the monarchy. In common with most deposed royal families, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty was initially vilified by the new revolutionary regime. Nonetheless, it has undergone re-evaluation in recent years; nostalgia for the former monarchy has been growing among some in Egypt, largely fuelled by the airing in 2007 of a hugely successful serial about the life of King Farouk I.\n\nParagraph 19: White spruce has a transcontinental range in North America. In Canada, its contiguous distribution encompasses virtually the whole of the Boreal, Subalpine, Montane, Columbia, Great Lakes\u2013St. Lawrence, and Acadian Forest Regions, extending into every province and territory. On the west coast of Hudson Bay, it extends to Seal River, about 59\u00b0N, \"from which the northward limit runs apparently almost directly north-west to near the mouth of the Mackenzie River, or about latitude 68\u00b0\". Collins and Sumner reported finding white spruce within 13\u00a0km of the Arctic coast in the Firth Valley, Yukon, at about 69\u00b030\u2032 N, 139\u00b030\u2032 W. It reaches within 100\u00a0km of the Pacific Ocean in the Skeena Valley, overlapping with the range of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), and almost reaching the Arctic Ocean at latitude 69\u00b0 N in the District of Mackenzie, with white spruce up to 15\u00a0m high occurring on some of the islands in the Delta near Inuvik. The wide variety of ecological conditions in which 4 Quebec conifers, including white spruce, are able to establish themselves, was noted by Lafond, but white spruce was more exacting than black spruce. In the United States, the range of white spruce extends into Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Alaska, where it reaches the Bering Strait in 66\u00b044\u2032 N\" at Norton Bay and the Gulf of Alaska at Cook Inlet.\n\nParagraph 20: There are conflicting interpretations on the building of the parochial church; some suggest that Father Jo\u00e3o Alves de Lordelo ordered the church in the 17th century, while others claim that its state occurred from remodelling occurring in 1794. Other religious buildings constructed in the region include the hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Necessidades, which was constructed in 1830; the Hermitage of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, along Canada do Bago, concluded in the second-half of the 17th century; the Hermitage of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, raised during the middle of the 17th century; and the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora do P\u00f3pulo, founded by Jacques de Padron.\n\nPlease enter the final count of unique paragraphs after removing duplicates.

In contrast to the \u201cinteresting\u201d story behind her name, Monaliza lived an unpleasant upbringing, which made her grow her anti-social attitude and most importantly an extreme inability to draw a smile. Now, 37 years old, and after 17 years of waiting for her turn to come in the long queue of applicants, Monaliza finally gets a governmental job at the Directorate of Archiving and makes a decision that it's time for her to go out into the world. This makes Afaf (Haifa Al Agha), her older unmarried agoraphobic sister who wants to keep Monaliza by her side, very unhappy. At the same time their outgoing neighbour, Rodaina(Suha Najjar), is trying to marry Monaliza off to her sleazy, older and still unwed brother, Suhail(Haidar Kfouf). Monaliza, fed up by Afaf constantly controlling her life, She tricks her into thinking that she is actually considering the proposal. In the office Monaliza meets Nayfeh (Nadera Omran), a bossy, prejudiced, disagreeable woman who keeps picking on everybody around and especially Hamdi (Shady Khalaf), the cheerful Egyptian cafeteria guy, who keeps trying to loosen her up with his coffee and jokes. Monaliza who's been living in an emotional ice cube for a long time, gradually opens up to Hamdi's charm and little by little lets him into her closed world and start to learn the joy of living. When Hamdi finally manages to draw a smile on Monaliza's face, things start getting complicated; Hamdi's work permit is expiring and he'll soon become \u201cillegal\u201d. On the other hand, Monaliza's trick backfires and suddenly everyone in the neighbourhood think that she is officially engaged to Suhail. Being socially inexperienced, and not wanting to lose the battle with Afaf, Monaliza doesn't know what to do about that neither she tells Hamdi about it. Until one day, after a big fight with Nayfeh in the office, Hamdi impulsively decided to show up at Monaliza's neighbourhood to meet her sister and propose, only to hear that Monaliza is already \u201cengaged\u201d to the grocer, Suhail. Feeling shocked and betrayed, Hamdi decides to go back to Egypt immediately and Monaliza thinks she must have lost him forever. But when Rodaina realizes the heartbreak, being a dedicated lover, she encourages Monaliza to run after him and work things out. Monaliza's story overlaps with a bunch of other characters\u2019 who surround her; the story of her sister Afaf and what brought her to become agoraphobic, and the story of Rodaina, who is still waiting for her husband who disappeared in Iraq several years ago, and the story of Nayfeh at the office and her inexcusable bitterness.\n\nParagraph 3: Following Will's arrival in Bel-Air, he was a great distance from home and was considered an outsider by many people in his Bel-Air neighborhood. Early on, he had a picture of Malcolm X on his wall. He often disagrees with his cousin Carlton, whom he sees as not quite \"black\" enough because he doesn't talk like other young African Americans. The next day at school, Carlton and Will show up and after failing to talk the bully down and scare her, they bribe her to leave Ashley alone for $50. Will becomes sick with an infection and must have his tonsils removed. At the hospital, Will befriend his roommate, an elderly patient named Max Jakey who has an optimistic and care-free attitude despite being cooped up in a hospital all the time. After suffering from nightmares about incompetent doctors, Will escapes and goes back home but is busted by Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv when Phil sits on top of Geoffrey's bed. Will is taken back to the hospital (complete with a bodyguard to prevent his escape) and has his surgery. Max later returns to retrieve his lucky hat, having been moved to Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Talking to Will and seeing a nurse come in, he gives Will his lucky hat to keep. While Smith sometimes perceives Phil as being overprotective of Ashley, he himself also can be; when Ashley asks him about sex, Will became shocked by Ashley's inquiry, which leads him and Carlton to go to a clinic to talk to a doctor about how to discuss sex with Ashley. Will and Carlton are punished for their behavior and ordered by Uncle Phil to get the bracelet back. At the pawn shop, Agnes is about to sell the bracelet to another customer for $550. Playing on the crush Agnes has on Carlton, he plans to have Carlton strip to get the bracelet. His father, Lou, who had abandoned him at childhood, returns in the episode \"Papa's Got A Brand New Excuse.\" His dad promises to take him on the road with him, but later drops Will, and the resulting disappointment breaks Will\u2019s heart. It is then that Smith tearfully realizes Philip is the closest thing he had to a father. Will and the Banks family vacation to Will's hometown in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where Will learns to his horror that he has a reputation as a chicken due to not fighting Omar, a local bully and instead going to live in Bel Air, Los Angeles. To salvage his reputation, Will plans to fight Omar on the basketball court where he had the notorious fight but finds that Omar is no longer a bully and has grown up, attempting to give back to his community and help people. Will refuses to take no for an answer and keeps trying to fight Omar, who reminds Will that he needs to grow up and stop worrying about his reputation. Will chooses to stay home an extra week with Vy but later calls Uncle Phil to tell him that he's not coming back. \n\nParagraph 4: Throughout the nineteenth century, the institution became known because of the efforts of missionaries serving throughout the world. In the 1870s, the campus was expanded with the construction of two buildings\u2014one housing a gymnasium and additional lecture space; the second, a library. The seminary desired to build a library first, citing the need to house its expanding collection of books. However, local businessman and seminary benefactor James Suydam donated funds to build the gymnasium, to be named Suydam Hall, because he was extremely concerned with student health. Suydam Hall was built in 1873 and was designed by architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh. Hardenbergh had finished completing the design for Kirkpatrick Chapel and Geology Hall on the Rutgers campus and later would become known for buildings in New York City, including the Plaza Hotel and Dakota Apartments. After receiving a donation from Gardner A. Sage earmarked for the construction of a library, the trustees commissioned Hardenbergh's former teacher, German-American architect Detlef Lienau, to design it. The Sage Library was completed in 1875.  Lienau designed the library to complement Hardenbergh's (style) design for Suydam Hall. In the 1960s, Suydam Hall and Hertzog Hall were deemed to be inadequate for the administrative and instructional needs of the seminary. The trustees voted in 1966 to demolish both buildings and replace it with a modern one-story all-purpose building, Zwemer Hall, containing the seminary's chapel, faculty offices, and classroom facilities.\n\nParagraph 5: When Monaliza Smiled is a romantic comedy film that takes place in Amman, Jordan and tells the story of Monaliza (Tahani Salim) who was named after a postcard of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.

At the age of 10, she was dancing in vaudeville as part of The White Sisters, leading to jobs with the Ziegfeld Follies and Earl Carroll revue, then moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s. Her first film was A Night in a Dormitory (1930) co-starring Ginger Rogers. This job led to a number of short films at Path\u00e9 Exchange (later RKO Pictures), where she played leading lady to familiar comics, such as Edgar Kennedy and Leon Errol.\n\nParagraph 8: \"Confide in Me\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Sean Smith labelled the track a \"classic\" to Minogue's discography, as similar to how William Baker viewed it. Larry Flick from Billboard complimented \"the gorgeously atmospheric, downtempo album cut\". Nick Levine from Digital Spy selected it as the standout, and commented \"How can we plump for anything other than 'Confide in Me'? Fifteen years on, this sumptuous, string-swathed dance-pop epic still caresses the ears like a flirty hair stylist.\" Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian noted that it \"has a classical violin overture that unfolds into a snake-charming Eastern melody. Kylie sounds delightfully woebegone.\" Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that \"the Brothers In Rhythm-produced gem was the stepping stone that took her from the glorious pop of \"Better The Devil You Know\" to collaborating with Nick Cave on \"Where The Wild Roses Grow\".\" He added that it was \"a vehicle to showcase a then-hugely-underrated voice.\" Music writer James Masterton deemed it a \"exotic, string-laden single\". Alan Jones from Music Week gave it five out of five, noting that \"a widescreen string-driven shuffle which allows her to deliver a soft and polished vocal.\" Tim Jeffery from the magazine's RM Dance Update said, \"Very Madonna-ish, in fact, even down to the giggly chuckle thrown in occasionally. Huge.\" Another editor, James Hamilton deemed it a \"Madonna-ishly moaned and muttered Brothers In Rhythm creation\". Quentin Harrison from PopMatters highlighted the track from the parent album, and said \"Minogue's international perspective lent her canvas precision, not iciness as witnessed with 'Confide in Me'. The cut played like a lost spy film accompaniment, its grandiose strings and rumbling groove enthralled. 'Confide in Me' let Minogue become the vocalist cynics sneered she'd never be\u00a0...\". British author and critic Adrian Denning enjoyed the track and called it \"truly timeless and absolutely wonderful.\" He declared the track \"Arguably still her finest musical moment to this date,\" and found the production and lyrical delivery \"classy\". Billboards Jason Lipshutz wrote of the track:\n\nParagraph 9: The process of running rounds in the 1500 tends to select strategic experts because nobody would want to run hard three times in four days as this schedule would require.  Since 2008 (excepting that bad race at the 2012 Olympics), the expert in this has been two-time defending champion Asbel Kiprop.  But in case anybody wanted to run fast, Kiprop also left a message at the fastest race of the year in Monaco, where he blew away many of the members of this field by almost 2 seconds in his near miss of the world record.  What makes Kiprop so dangerous is his ability to accelerate from the back of the field and in the final that is exactly where he went.  Was he hiding or just waiting to pounce?  With three other Kenyan teammates making it to the final, there was talk about a potential sweep.  Timothy Cheruiyot and Elijah Motonei Manangoi took the race through an honest first two laps in 1:58.62.  Only Aman Wote ran aggressively with them at the front, the other tacticians lining themselves up for the finish.  Matthew Centrowitz, Jr. was the first to move forward as they came through for the bell.  With 300 metres to go, Olympic champion Taoufik Makhloufi made his move, identical to the Olympics, Kiprop near the back of the pack beating only two Americans and boxed by Wote.  Over the next 100 metres, Makhloufi opened a lead chase by Abdalaati Iguider.  Kiprop slowed down to get out of the box, then ran around Wote out to lane 3.  The tall Kenyan was now clearly moving faster than the rest of the field he was passing on the outside.  As Kiprop swept past the field after the North African duo, only Silas Kiplagat came with him, these four breaking from the rest.  As Kiprop caught Iguider, he reacted and ran even with Kiprop up to Makhloufi.  With 50 metres to go, it was three abreast across the track with Kiplagat chasing Kiprop on the outside less than two metres back.  Kiprop broke past the two North Africans and ran on to victory, while Iguider edged ahead of a spent Makhloufi.  Out of nowhere (actually a distant fifth place) came sprinting Manangoi, faster than any of the leaders, drifting out to lane 3 for clear sailing.  Passing three people in the last 10 metres, Manangoi crossed the finish line just ahead of a desperately diving Iguider to take silver, Iguider doing a full face plant to the track across the finish line holding on to bronze.\n\nParagraph 10: Restoration work began on the monastery after 1860, starting with the southern fa\u00e7ade under supervision of the architect Rafael Silva e Castro, and in 1898 under Domingos Parente da Silva. Although the cloister cistern, internal clerical cells and the kitchen were demolished at this time, three reconstruction projects proposed by architect J. Colson, including the introduction of revivalist neo-Manueline elements, failed to gain the required approval. In 1863, architect Valentim Jos\u00e9 Correia was hired by the ombudsman of the Casa Pia, Eug\u00e9nio de Almeida, to reorganise the second storey of the old dormitory and design the windows (1863\u20131865). He was subsequently replaced by Samuel Barret, who constructed the towers in the extreme western end of the dormitories. Similarly and inexplicably, Barret was replaced by the Italian scenery designers Rambois and Cinatti, who had worked on the design of the S\u00e3o Carlos Theatre, to continue the remodelling within the monastery in 1867. Between 1867 and 1868, they profoundly altered the annex and fa\u00e7ade of the Church, which then appeared as it does today. They demolished the gallery and Hall of the Kings, constructed the towers of the eastern dormitory, the rose window of the upper choir and substituted the pyramid-shaped roof of the bell tower with the mitre-shaped design. The remodelling was delayed by the 1878 collapse of the central dormitory. After 1884, Raymundo Valladas began to contribute, initiating in 1886 the restoration of the cloister and the Sala do Cap\u00edtulo, including construction of the vaulted ceiling. The tomb of Alexandre Herculano, designed by Eduardo Augusto da Silva, was placed in the Sala do Cap\u00edtulo in 1888.\n\nParagraph 11: \"Confide in Me\" received critical acclaim from music critics.

This large temple complex comprises the main temple of Baba Baidyanath, where the Jyotirlinga is installed, along with twenty-one other temples. This temple is also one of fifty one Shaktipeeth of Goddess Durga where It is believed that the heart of Sati fell at Baidyanath Dham when Lord Vishnu used the Sudarshana Chakra, to cut Sati's corpse in order to stop Shiva's destruction. Here the deity is worshiped in form of Jaya Durga. The temple is mentioned in several ancient scriptures and continues to be mentioned even in modern-day history books. The story of the origin of this Jyotirlinga goes back to the Treta Yuga, in the era of Lord Rama. According to popular Hindu beliefs, Ravana The King of Lanka Once felt that his capital would be incomplete and under the constant threat of enemies unless Lord Shiva decides to stay there forever. So, he went to the Himalayas to impress the Lord and started offering his heads one after another. When he was about to cut off his tenth head, Lord Shiva descended on Earth impressed by his devotee. He then cured the wounded Ravana and granted him a boon. Ravana requested Lord Shiva to allow him to take the Shivalinga back to Lanka with him to which the Lord agreed but on one condition. Lord Shiva warned Ravana that he cannot keep the Shivalinga on the ground until he reaches Lanka and if he does so it will get fixed to the ground and he will never be able to uproot it. Ravana agreed to the condition and began his journey. All the other God and Goddess were not happy with the decision because they knew, if Shiva went to Lanka with Ravana, then he would become invincible and his evil deeds would threaten the world. They met Lord Vishnu and asked him to stop Ravana, the demon king from taking the Shivalinga to Lanka. Lord Vishnu asked Lord Varun, the Ocean God to enter the stomach of Ravana at the time he performs Aachamanam during the Sandhya Vandana, the evening prayer. Aachamanam is a process of purifying by sipping drops of water while reciting the 21 names of Vishnu. When Ravana reached Deoghar, it was almost evening so he decided to perform his evening prayers. As asked, Lord Varun entered his stomach during the Aachamanam and Ravana felt an urgent need to release himself. He gave the Shivalinga to a milkman and asked him to take care of the lingam until he comes back. To utter surprise, the more Ravana released himself, the more he felt the urge. He took a long time to come back and the impatient milkman kept the shiva linga on the ground and went away. When Ravana finally returned he saw that the Shivalinga was fixed on the ground. He tried a lot to uproot it but failed miserably. Ravana damaged the Shivalinga in the process. He understood that the milkman was Lord Vishnu who pranked him and left the place in anger. Later, God and Goddess came down from heaven and established the Shivalinga. Every monsoon (in the month of Shravan) millions of devotees undertake a rigorous  pilgrimage on foot from Ajgaibinath, Sultanganj to offer holy water and prayers to Baba Baidyanath. The pilgrimage is deemed complete with homage paid at Basukinath which is almost  from Deoghar.\n\nParagraph 14:  Baidyanath Dham Temple: Baidyanath Jyotirlinga temple, also commonly referred to as the Baidyanath Dham, is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga in India and is considered to be the most sacred abodes of Lord Shiva.The temple is located in Deoghar in the Santhal Parganas division of the state of Jharkhand in India.

This temple is also one of fifty one Shaktipeeth of Goddess Durga where It is believed that the heart of Sati fell at Baidyanath Dham when Lord Vishnu used the Sudarshana Chakra, to cut Sati's corpse in order to stop Shiva's destruction. Here the deity is worshiped in form of Jaya Durga. The temple is mentioned in several ancient scriptures and continues to be mentioned even in modern-day history books. The story of the origin of this Jyotirlinga goes back to the Treta Yuga, in the era of Lord Rama. According to popular Hindu beliefs, Ravana The King of Lanka Once felt that his capital would be incomplete and under the constant threat of enemies unless Lord Shiva decides to stay there forever. So, he went to the Himalayas to impress the Lord and started offering his heads one after another. When he was about to cut off his tenth head, Lord Shiva descended on Earth impressed by his devotee. He then cured the wounded Ravana and granted him a boon. Ravana requested Lord Shiva to allow him to take the Shivalinga back to Lanka with him to which the Lord agreed but on one condition. Lord Shiva warned Ravana that he cannot keep the Shivalinga on the ground until he reaches Lanka and if he does so it will get fixed to the ground and he will never be able to uproot it. Ravana agreed to the condition and began his journey. All the other God and Goddess were not happy with the decision because they knew, if Shiva went to Lanka with Ravana, then he would become invincible and his evil deeds would threaten the world. They met Lord Vishnu and asked him to stop Ravana, the demon king from taking the Shivalinga to Lanka. Lord Vishnu asked Lord Varun, the Ocean God to enter the stomach of Ravana at the time he performs Aachamanam during the Sandhya Vandana, the evening prayer. Aachamanam is a process of purifying by sipping drops of water while reciting the 21 names of Vishnu. When Ravana reached Deoghar, it was almost evening so he decided to perform his evening prayers. As asked, Lord Varun entered his stomach during the Aachamanam and Ravana felt an urgent need to release himself. He gave the Shivalinga to a milkman and asked him to take care of the lingam until he comes back. To utter surprise, the more Ravana released himself, the more he felt the urge. He took a long time to come back and the impatient milkman kept the shiva linga on the ground and went away. When Ravana finally returned he saw that the Shivalinga was fixed on the ground. He tried a lot to uproot it but failed miserably. Ravana damaged the Shivalinga in the process. He understood that the milkman was Lord Vishnu who pranked him and left the place in anger. Later, God and Goddess came down from heaven and established the Shivalinga. Every monsoon (in the month of Shravan) millions of devotees undertake a rigorous  pilgrimage on foot from Ajgaibinath, Sultanganj to offer holy water and prayers to Baba Baidyanath. The pilgrimage is deemed complete with homage paid at Basukinath which is almost  from Deoghar.\n\nParagraph 15: There are conflicting interpretations on the building of the parochial church; some suggest that Father Jo\u00e3o Alves de Lordelo ordered the church in the 17th century, while others claim that its state occurred from remodelling occurring in 1794. Other religious buildings constructed in the region include the hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Necessidades, which was constructed in 1830; the Hermitage of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, along Canada do Bago, concluded in the second-half of the 17th century; the Hermitage of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, raised during the middle of the 17th century; and the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora do P\u00f3pulo, founded by Jacques de Padron.\n\nParagraph 16: Restoration work began on the monastery after 1860, starting with the southern fa\u00e7ade under supervision of the architect Rafael Silva e Castro, and in 1898 under Domingos Parente da Silva. Although the cloister cistern, internal clerical cells and the kitchen were demolished at this time, three reconstruction projects proposed by architect J. Colson, including the introduction of revivalist neo-Manueline elements, failed to gain the required approval. In 1863, architect Valentim Jos\u00e9 Correia was hired by the ombudsman of the Casa Pia, Eug\u00e9nio de Almeida, to reorganise the second storey of the old dormitory and design the windows (1863\u20131865). He was subsequently replaced by Samuel Barret, who constructed the towers in the extreme western end of the dormitories. Similarly and inexplicably, Barret was replaced by the Italian scenery designers Rambois and Cinatti, who had worked on the design of the S\u00e3o Carlos Theatre, to continue the remodelling within the monastery in 1867. Between 1867 and 1868, they profoundly altered the annex and fa\u00e7ade of the Church, which then appeared as it does today. They demolished the gallery and Hall of the Kings, constructed the towers of the eastern dormitory, the rose window of the upper choir and substituted the pyramid-shaped roof of the bell tower with the mitre-shaped design. The remodelling was delayed by the 1878 collapse of the central dormitory. After 1884, Raymundo Valladas began to contribute, initiating in 1886 the restoration of the cloister and the Sala do Cap\u00edtulo, including construction of the vaulted ceiling. The tomb of Alexandre Herculano, designed by Eduardo Augusto da Silva, was placed in the Sala do Cap\u00edtulo in 1888.\n\nParagraph 17: Throughout the nineteenth century, the institution became known because of the efforts of missionaries serving throughout the world. In the 1870s, the campus was expanded with the construction of two buildings\u2014one housing a gymnasium and additional lecture space; the second, a library. The seminary desired to build a library first, citing the need to house its expanding collection of books. However, local businessman and seminary benefactor James Suydam donated funds to build the gymnasium, to be named Suydam Hall, because he was extremely concerned with student health. Suydam Hall was built in 1873 and was designed by architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh. Hardenbergh had finished completing the design for Kirkpatrick Chapel and Geology Hall on the Rutgers campus and later would become known for buildings in New York City, including the Plaza Hotel and Dakota Apartments. After receiving a donation from Gardner A. Sage earmarked for the construction of a library, the trustees commissioned Hardenbergh's former teacher, German-American architect Detlef Lienau, to design it. The Sage Library was completed in 1875.  Lienau designed the library to complement Hardenbergh's (style) design for Suydam Hall. In the 1960s, Suydam Hall and Hertzog Hall were deemed to be inadequate for the administrative and instructional needs of the seminary. The trustees voted in 1966 to demolish both buildings and replace it with a modern one-story all-purpose building, Zwemer Hall, containing the seminary's chapel, faculty offices, and classroom facilities.\n\nParagraph 18: Rulers of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty governed Egypt and Sudan as absolute monarchs until constitutional rule was established in August 1878. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy emerged as the most important in the Middle East and the wider Arab world. Finding themselves as mere figureheads during the period of British control, Egypt and Sudan's monarchs saw their powers increased following the recognition of independence, and the subsequent adoption of the 1923 Constitution, the most liberal in the country's history. Although King Fuad I often ruled as an autocrat, partly because he repeatedly overrode some provisions of the Constitution, Egypt and Sudan had the freest parliament in the region. During Fuad's reign and that of his son, Farouk, the country witnessed six free parliamentary elections and enjoyed a free press as well as an independent judiciary. According to historian Philip Mansel, \"the Egyptian monarchy appeared so splendid, powerful and popular that King Farouk's ignominious end seems inexplicable.\" The Muhammad Ali Dynasty's downfall is often regarded as having begun with the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which greatly discredited the King. It accelerated with the growing discontent of Egypt's armed forces following the country's defeat in the First Arab-Israeli War. Disgruntled members of the military formed the Free Officers Movement, which led a coup d'\u00e9tat on 23 July 1952, thereby marking the beginning of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The toppling of the monarchy, and the resultant establishment of a revolutionary republican government, was the first of its kind in the modern Arab world, and was a crucial event in the region's history; it accelerated dramatically the rise of Pan-Arabism, and had a domino effect leading to similar military overthrows of the monarchies of Iraq (1958), North Yemen (1962), and Libya (1969). Egypt has had a republican form of government since the end of monarchical rule. Although the establishment of genuine democratic rule was one of the six core principles of the Revolution, political parties were banned in 1953 and the country was turned into a military dictatorship. The thriving pluralism that characterized political life during the latter period of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule was thus brought to an end. Even though a multi-party system was officially restored in Egypt in 1976, the country has never recovered the level of political freedom it had enjoyed during the monarchy. In common with most deposed royal families, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty was initially vilified by the new revolutionary regime. Nonetheless, it has undergone re-evaluation in recent years; nostalgia for the former monarchy has been growing among some in Egypt, largely fuelled by the airing in 2007 of a hugely successful serial about the life of King Farouk I.\n\nParagraph 19: White spruce has a transcontinental range in North America. In Canada, its contiguous distribution encompasses virtually the whole of the Boreal, Subalpine, Montane, Columbia, Great Lakes\u2013St. Lawrence, and Acadian Forest Regions, extending into every province and territory. On the west coast of Hudson Bay, it extends to Seal River, about 59\u00b0N, \"from which the northward limit runs apparently almost directly north-west to near the mouth of the Mackenzie River, or about latitude 68\u00b0\". Collins and Sumner reported finding white spruce within 13\u00a0km of the Arctic coast in the Firth Valley, Yukon, at about 69\u00b030\u2032 N, 139\u00b030\u2032 W. It reaches within 100\u00a0km of the Pacific Ocean in the Skeena Valley, overlapping with the range of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), and almost reaching the Arctic Ocean at latitude 69\u00b0 N in the District of Mackenzie, with white spruce up to 15\u00a0m high occurring on some of the islands in the Delta near Inuvik. The wide variety of ecological conditions in which 4 Quebec conifers, including white spruce, are able to establish themselves, was noted by Lafond, but white spruce was more exacting than black spruce. In the United States, the range of white spruce extends into Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Alaska, where it reaches the Bering Strait in 66\u00b044\u2032 N\" at Norton Bay and the Gulf of Alaska at Cook Inlet.\n\nParagraph 20: There are conflicting interpretations on the building of the parochial church; some suggest that Father Jo\u00e3o Alves de Lordelo ordered the church in the 17th century, while others claim that its state occurred from remodelling occurring in 1794.

The ship's coat-of-arms depict three golden chalices which represent the three ancient dioceses among which Tipperary was divided. Also featured is a Celtic cross as a representation of the North Cross at Ahenny, County Tipperary. The coat of arms incorporates the Tipperary colours of Blue and Yellow as well as the background or field colours of the Tipperary Arms which is Ermine - white with a pattern of black arrowhead shaped points.\n\nParagraph 2: New York Avenue was planned as one of the original streets in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C.  It was intended to begin at the Potomac River and extend northeast toward the White House, then continue past the Executive Residence northeast to the boundary of the Federal City. The portion of the street southwest of the White House was to give the President of the United States an uninterrupted view of the river. Construction of the State, War, and Navy Building from 1871 to 1888 blocked this view, and it remains blocked to this day. Originally, it extended to the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the construction of Rawlins Park in 1873 destroyed a block of New York Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets NW. Its consolidation with Triangle Park and three other \"parklets\" into a \"Little Mall\" (in apparent imitation of the nearby National Mall) in 1937 consumed another block between 20th and 21st Streets NW. Construction of the United States Department of War Building (now the Harry S Truman Building, housing the United States Department of State), and an associated park (since January 1959, known as Edward J. Kelly Park) from 1940 to 1941 destroyed the lower three blocks of New York Avenue. Construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Building (which now houses the United States Office of Personnel Management) in 1963 eliminated another block between 19th and 20th Streets NW.  This left a single block of New York Avenue NW, between 17th and 18th Streets NW, southeast of the White House.\n\nParagraph 3: If a small freight or commuter railroad does not operate on another railroad territory, then there is no interoperability-based reason that obligates them to use  spectrum to implement PTC. In addition, if a small freight or commuter railroad only operates on their own territory and hosts other guest railroads (freight or other passenger rail), there is still no interoperability-based reason the host is obliged to use  spectrum to implement PTC. Such a railroad could implement PTC by freely picking any radio spectrum and requiring the guest railroads to either install compliant PTC equipment (including radios) on board their trains or provide wayside equipment for their guest PTC implementation to be installed on the host railroad property. An interesting case that highlights some of these issues is the northeast corridor. Amtrak operates services on two commuter rail properties it does not own: Metro-North Railroad (owned by New York and Connecticut) and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) (owned by Massachusetts). In theory, Amtrak could have found themselves installing their own PTC system on these host properties (about 15 percent of the corridor), or worse, found themselves in the ridiculous position of trying to install three different PTC systems on each Amtrak train to traverse the commuter properties. This was not the case. Amtrak had a significant head start over the commuter rail agencies on the corridor in implementing PTC. They spent a considerable amount of time in research and development and won early approvals for their ACSES system on the northeast corridor with the FRA. They chose first to use  and then later moved to , in part because of a perceived improvement in radio-system performance and in part because Amtrak was using  in Michigan for their ITCS implementation.  When the commuter agencies on the corridor looked at options for implementing PTC, many of them chose to take advantage of the advance work Amtrak had done and implement the ACSES solution using . Amtrak's early work paid off and meant that they would be traversing commuter properties that installed the same protocol at the same frequency, making them all interoperable. (Actually most of the Northeast Corridor is owned and operated by Amtrak, not the commuter properties, including the tracks from Washington, D.C. to New York Penn Station and the tracks from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The State of Massachusetts owns the tracks from the Rhode Island state line to the New Hampshire state line, but Amtrak \"operates\" these lines. Only the line between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut is actually owned and operated by a commuter line.)\n\nParagraph 4: Born in Stratford,  Tomlinson completed preparatory studies and graduated from Yale College in 1802. He went to Virginia for a year to be a private tutor and to study law.  When he returned to Fairfield he continued his studies and was admitted to the bar in 1807. That same year he married Sarah Bradley. He received a Master of Arts, in 1808 from Yale. Their only child, Jabez Huntington Tomlinson, was born in 1818 but died at the young age of 19 in 1838.  Mrs. Tomlinson died in 1842. In 1846, Gideon married Mrs. Lydia Ann Wells Wright, widow of William Wright of Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nParagraph 5: MBC Action (stylized as MBCACTION) is a free-to-air television channel that MBC Group\u2019s action-packed channel that targets young Arabic males.

The sea state was 6 to 7 at the meeting place, Rogge and Merten decided to move the meeting place  southwest. The next day, they met again and provisions were transferred to U-68. During the following night, U-68 conducted a number of mock attacks on Atlantis for training purposes. On 23 November, U-68 received the message that Atlantis had been sunk by  while resupplying  under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Ernst Bauer. U-126 was able to rescue up 300 German sailors, including Rogge. The Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote (BdU\u2014supreme commander of the U-boat Arm) ordered , under the command of Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Johann Mohr, , under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Nicolai Clausen, and , under the command of Fregattenkapit\u00e4n Hans Eckermann, to the rescue. Two days later the survivors were transferred to the refueling ship Python. On 30 November, U-68 and UA met with Python for refueling. Immediately Merten and the crew began taking on fuel,  were transferred, as well as replenishing spent torpedoes. UA was late to arrive, unnecessarily delaying the procedure. During the refueling, a smokestack was sighted, sounding the alarms. U-68 had just finished the transfer, but the additional weight of the boat was not yet accounted for, when Python came under attack from . U-68 was not ready for combat, Merten and the crew had difficulties keeping the boat at depth. During the vital phase of the attack U-68 was oscillating between a depth of  and . Holding the boat at periscope depth was impossible. Submerged, the crew of U-68 could hear the sinking of Python. Following the first warning salvo by Dorsetshire, Pythons crew its crew had chosen to scuttle the ship to avoid unnecessary casualties.\n\nParagraph 7: The 19th century did not witness the emergence of any political organization that could help in airing the grievances and expressing the aspirations of Nigerians on a constant basis. The British presence in the early 20th century led to the formation of political organizations as the measures brought by the British were no longer conducive for Nigerians. The old political methods practiced in Lagos was seen as no longer adequate to meet the new situation. The first of such organizations was the People's Union formed by Orisadipe Obasa and John K. Randle with the main aim of agitating against the water rate but also to champion the interests of the people of Lagos. This body became popular and attracted members of all sections of community including the Chief Imam of Lagos, as well as Alli Balogun, a wealthy Muslim. The popularity of the organization reduced after it was unable to prevent the imposition of the water rate by 1916. The organization was also handicapped by constant disagreements among the leaders. The emergence of the NCBWA and the NNDP in 1920 and 1923 respectively, led to a major loss of supporters of the People's Union, and by 1926, it had completely ceased to exist. Two years after the formation of the People's Union, another organization called The Lagos Ancillary of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society (LAARPS) came into the picture. This society was not a political organization but a humanitarian body. This organization came into existence to fight for the interest of Nigerians generally but its attention was taken up by the struggle over the land issue of 1912. In Northern Nigeria, all lands were taken over by the administration and held in trust for the people. Those in Southern Nigeria feared that this method would be introduced into the South. Educated Africans believed that if they can be successful in preventing the system from being extended to Southern Nigeria, then they can fight to destroy its practice in the North. This movement attracted personalities in Lagos amongst whom are James Johnson, Mojola Agbebi, Candido Da Rocha, Christopher Sapara Williams, Samuel Herbert Pearse, Cardoso, Adeyemo Alakija and John Payne Jackson (Editor, Lagos Weekly Record). Its delegation to London to present its views to the British government was discredited by quarrels which broke out among its members over the delegation fund. Accusations of embezzlement against some members, disagreements and quarrels, as well as the death of some of its leading members led to the untimely death of this organization before 1920. The outbreak of war and a strong political awareness led to the formation of a number of organizations. These are the Lagos Branch of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP).\n\nParagraph 8: Throughout Roosevelt's presidency, he returned to the same theme continually over the course of the New Deal. Also in the Atlantic Charter, an international commitment was made as the Allies thought about how to \"win the peace\" following victory in the Second World War. The US' commitment to non-interventionism in World War II ending with the 1941 Lend-Lease act, and later Pearl Harbor attacks, resulted in the mobilisation of the war state. The generous terms of the act, in conjunction with the economic growth of the US were key in allowing the US to establish new global order with the help of Allied powers in the aftermath of war. This motivation to establish a new global order provided the infrastructure for the implementation of an international standard of human rights, seen with the Second Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Akira Iriye's proposition that the US desired to transform the post war Pacific after their own image is representative of the wider desire to raise global standards to that of the US, feeding into ideals of American Exceptionalism. The effect of wider democratisation and social reform is divulged upon in Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man.\n\nParagraph 9: MBC Action (stylized as MBCACTION) is a free-to-air television channel that MBC Group\u2019s action-packed channel that targets young Arabic males.

Also known as the Grim Reaper, he is feared by the NOL for being the most powerful individual to have ever rebelled against them since the Ikaruga Civil War. His actions, which included destroying countless numbers of their branches, have labeled him the most wanted criminal and caused him to receive the largest bounty ever in the history of the NOL. He possesses a powerful form of ars magus called the Azure Grimoire, or simply referred to as the titular BlazBlue, which is often either the secondary or primary target of those after him and his bounty. His ultimate goal is to destroy the NOL, for he blames them for destroying his family. He is Jin Kisaragi's biological brother, whose rivalry with him stems from an incident that happened when their sister Saya was presumably killed. His right arm is mechanical because his real one was cut off by Terumi, who had taken control of Jin's mind. He was resurrected by Rachel as a dhampir, causing one of his green eyes to turn red and his once-blond hair to white. The BlazBlue he possesses is only a fragment of an imitation; the true Grimoire is actually destined to be wielded by Noel Vermillion. In Continuum Shift, Ragna is given the Idea Engine by a dying Lambda which enabled him to access the true Azure. He realizes that Saya is possessed by Izanami and decides to give up vengeance to protect his loved ones in Chrono Phantasma, and later in Central Fiction decides to protect the girl inside Amaterasu from the Entitled-people whose dreams are strong enough to remake the world. He and Jin (including his future-past counterpart Hakumen) soon learned that Noel/Mu can be used to recreate Saya, whose soul remains in her old body, possessed by Izanami. Once Noel and Mu merge, he helps Noel merge with Izanami and imprison her into her soul, recreating Saya. With the help of Jin and Trinity after Ragna separates the Susano'o armor from Terumi, Jin transports Ragna and Terumi to the Azure void where Ragna can kill him for good. Once all evils are finished, and after helping Noel merge with the Origin to free her from the Amaterasu Unit, Ragna's last act is to cast himself into the cauldron and remain outside the world, to make sure the Azure never falls into the wrong hands. As this act would erase himself from the memories of everybody in the story, he says goodbye to his beloved siblings and tells Amane that he has no regrets at all. Ragna disappears and leaves only his sword behind, which is later put to the hill where it is placed on a hill near Celica's church as a makeshift grave. Whether or not Ragna is truly unable to return to the world is unknown, as the final scene shows that his sword has been taken by somebody. He is also hinted not to be a natural-born human due to his unusual features, an idea that is confirmed in the final game when it is revealed he is the child of the fifth Prime Field Device. Ragna's weapon is called Blood-Scythe (\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba Buraddo Saizu), a giant sword that can extend into a scythe. His Drive, Soul Eater, enables him to absorb a portion of the damage dealt to replenish his health.\n\nParagraph 11: In 1373, John brought about a new alliance against Hesse under the name: Bund der alten Minne (Alliance of the Old Love). It was actually aimed at the conquest of Driedorf, and John seems to have been the leader of the alliance. The members, mostly Sterners, now called themselves: Gesellen der alten Minne (Fellows of the Old Love). The Hessians were defeated by John at Wetzlar, who then plundered the districts of , Giessen, , , Biedenkopf, Caldern, Marburg, and others, and caused great damage to the landgrave everywhere. Perhaps it was a further consequence of this victory that John drove the Hessians out of Driedorf. The settlement of 1378 at least proves that he had regained possession of this castle and district, although there are no definite records of when this happened and how Driedorf was returned to Hesse after 1378. This much is certain: the hostilities against Landgrave Henry and his successors continued for several years after 1373. Anyone who had a dispute with Hesse could count on John\u02bcs support. John entered into a special alliance with Count John of Solms in 1375 because of the dispute between the latter and Hesse over the Lordship of Lich. Finally, under the mediation of the Hoch- und Deutschmeister Johann von Hayn and the counts of Katzenelnbogen and Sponheim, a provisional settlement was reached in Friedberg in 1377. A further reconciliation, the conditions of which were not stated, was initiated by Duke Otto\u00a0I of Brunswick-G\u00f6ttingen, and also recognised in 1378 at a personal meeting of Herman and John in Frankfurt before counts Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg and Diether\u00a0VIII of Katzenelnbogen as chosen arbitrators, that John should be left undisturbed in the castle of Driedorf and its appurtenances, that the fiefs of the lordship of Itter should be returned to him, that the castle built by Hesse at the River Dill, presumably at Hermannstein, should be dismantled, and that, contrary to custom, no toll should be taken from John\u02bcs subjects there. Landgrave Herman, however, did not want to settle down with this decision, but nevertheless promised to give John a hearing before his knights and men on the matter of Driedorf and Itter. Whether this was done is unknown. At least this did not end the dispute. As early as 1379, John joined a new alliance against Hesse, which was established in the Wetterau under the name of the Gesellschaft mit dem L\u00f6wen (Society with the Lions). The hostilities continued for more than 30\u00a0years, but with several interruptions, especially during the alliance of 1390 against the common enemy, Count John\u00a0III of Sayn-Wittgenstein, and although they ceased in 1411 by a treaty between Herman and John, they soon resumed under their sons. John also seems to have been a member of a Gesellschaft mit den H\u00f6rnern (Society with the Horns), which was also established around this time with the purpose of mutual defence and assistance.\n\nParagraph 12: Keats introduced four new projects in 2010. In January he created a pinhole camera intended to take a single 100-year-long exposure. Printed in Good Magazine, the simple box camera was designed to be cut out, folded, and glued together, and then left to take a picture which the magazine promised to publish in a \"special folio\" as part of the January 2110 issue. In February, Keats expanded his filmmaking for plants into a new genre. Observing that plants aren't mobile, he produced a travel documentary \u2013 showing footage of Italian skies \u2013 which he screened for an audience of ficus and palm trees at the AC Institute in New York City through early March, and later in the year presented to an audience of mixed species, with musical accompaniment by the composer Theresa Wong, at the Berkeley Art Museum in California. He also produced an online version of the movie for viewing by plants at home, posted by Wired News Following an AFP wire story, news of the travel documentaries was reported worldwide, though not in Italy. Keats launched an alternative space agency, the Local Air and Space Administration (LASA), in October. Headquartered at California State University, Chico, the organization claimed to be taking on the exploratory role abandoned by NASA, and announced simultaneous missions to the Moon and Mars. Rather than building rockets, LASA amassed lunar and martian terrain locally in California, by pulverizing meteorites. The first LASA astronauts were potatoes grown in water mineralized with lunar anorthosite and martian shergottite, exploring the Moon and Mars by osmosis, according to Keats, who further argued that the minerals they absorbed over their month-long missions made them \"alien hybrids\". LASA also entered the space tourism business, offering humans the opportunity to explore the Moon and Mars by buying and drinking bottled lunar and martian mineral waters at an \"exotourism bureau\" in San Francisco. At the same time that he was managing the Local Air & Space Administration, Keats started independently to produce pornography for God. The source for his pornography was the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which had just begun to replicate Big Bang conditions at a small scale. Reasoning that the Big Bang was \"divine coitus\", Keats screened a live feed from the LHC on a votive altar. He opened his \"porn palace for God\" at the alternative art space Louis V. ESP in Brooklyn, New York. While Keats explained that he had become \"God's pornographer\" in order to encourage God to create additional universes since our own was doomed by cosmic expansion, worldwide opinion on the worthiness of his project was mixed.\n\nParagraph 13: Normanhurst is divided by Pennant Hills Road, a major north-south road that leads north to the M1 Motorway, and south towards Parramatta. However, both the east and west sections have extensive bush access. On the east side, a small section of bush lies between Normanhurst and Fox Valley. This is land occupied by the SAN Hospital. On the western side, the suburb backs onto the southern reaches of the Berowra Valley, a continuous section of bush stretching all the way to Broken Bay. This gives Normanhurst a very \"leafy\" and rural look. This in turn contributes to making native bird life abundant. The area is home to cockatoos, rainbow lorikeets, kookaburras, noisy miners, native brush turkeys, and powerful owls. Additionally, Normanhurst has several small waterfalls, which promote reptile and marsupial life, such as Eastern grey kangaroos, echidnas and red-bellied black snakes. It also has encouraged the growth of retirement residences in the suburb. The Hornsby Shire Historical Society and Museum is located on Kenley Road.\n\nParagraph 14: On 13 November 1941, U-68 was resupplied by the auxiliary cruiser Atlantis under the command of Kapit\u00e4n zur See Bernhard Rogge. The sea state was 6 to 7 at the meeting place, Rogge and Merten decided to move the meeting place  southwest. The next day, they met again and provisions were transferred to U-68. During the following night, U-68 conducted a number of mock attacks on Atlantis for training purposes. On 23 November, U-68 received the message that Atlantis had been sunk by  while resupplying  under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Ernst Bauer. U-126 was able to rescue up 300 German sailors, including Rogge. The Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote (BdU\u2014supreme commander of the U-boat Arm) ordered , under the command of Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Johann Mohr, , under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Nicolai Clausen, and , under the command of Fregattenkapit\u00e4n Hans Eckermann, to the rescue. Two days later the survivors were transferred to the refueling ship Python. On 30 November, U-68 and UA met with Python for refueling. Immediately Merten and the crew began taking on fuel,  were transferred, as well as replenishing spent torpedoes. UA was late to arrive, unnecessarily delaying the procedure. During the refueling, a smokestack was sighted, sounding the alarms. U-68 had just finished the transfer, but the additional weight of the boat was not yet accounted for, when Python came under attack from . U-68 was not ready for combat, Merten and the crew had difficulties keeping the boat at depth. During the vital phase of the attack U-68 was oscillating between a depth of  and . Holding the boat at periscope depth was impossible. Submerged, the crew of U-68 could hear the sinking of Python. Following the first warning salvo by Dorsetshire, Pythons crew its crew had chosen to scuttle the ship to avoid unnecessary casualties.\n\nParagraph 15: New York Avenue was planned as one of the original streets in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C.  It was intended to begin at the Potomac River and extend northeast toward the White House, then continue past the Executive Residence northeast to the boundary of the Federal City. The portion of the street southwest of the White House was to give the President of the United States an uninterrupted view of the river. Construction of the State, War, and Navy Building from 1871 to 1888 blocked this view, and it remains blocked to this day. Originally, it extended to the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the construction of Rawlins Park in 1873 destroyed a block of New York Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets NW. Its consolidation with Triangle Park and three other \"parklets\" into a \"Little Mall\" (in apparent imitation of the nearby National Mall) in 1937 consumed another block between 20th and 21st Streets NW. Construction of the United States Department of War Building (now the Harry S Truman Building, housing the United States Department of State), and an associated park (since January 1959, known as Edward J. Kelly Park) from 1940 to 1941 destroyed the lower three blocks of New York Avenue. Construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Building (which now houses the United States Office of Personnel Management) in 1963 eliminated another block between 19th and 20th Streets NW.  This left a single block of New York Avenue NW, between 17th and 18th Streets NW, southeast of the White House.\n\nParagraph 16: The  globin is thought to be a very ancient molecule, even acting as a molecular clock of sorts. It has even been used to date the separation of vertebrates and invertebrates more than 1 billion years ago. Globin enjoys a large biological distribution, not only occurring among more than 9 different phyla of animals but occurring in some fungi and bacteria as well, even being identified in nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of some leguminous plants. The isolation of the globin gene from plant root cells has suggested that the globin genes that were inherited from a common ancestor shared by plants and animals may be present in all plants.\n\nParagraph 17: Wadsley Bridge continues to develop; the Kilner Way retail park opened in the 1970s, being built on the site of an old brick works and sandstone quarry. In 2008 it underwent a complete revamp with the old buildings being pulled down and eight new large retail unit being built for shops such as Halfords and Matalan. Development in recent years has given the area at the foot of Leppings Lane a Burger King and a Carphone Warehouse, built utilising the roof of the former service station on the site. There are three public houses in Wadsley Bridge, the New Bridge Inn dates from 1833, originally the New Inn but renamed in the 1970s when the new railway bridge was constructed, the Railway and the Pheasant. Recently demolished are the Gate Inn which dated originally from 1828; it was demolished in the early 1970s when the A61 was widened and new pub put in its place, and the Travellers which dated from 1881 although parts of the building were probably much older. Both pubs were demolished in late August 2012 to make way for a Sainsbury's supermarket. Construction of the supermarket was started in May 2014 and it opened on 26 November 2014.\n\nParagraph 18: Another explanation given is that in ancient Mesopotamia divine names were written in one way and pronounced in another. Thus it is possible for borrowed words to have their consonants reversed. Another explanation is that Muhammad adopted Isa from the polemical Jewish form Esau. However, there is no evidence that the Jews have ever used Esau to refer to Jesus, and if Muhammad had unwittingly adopted a pejorative form his many Christian acquaintances would have corrected him. A fourth explanation is that prior to the rise of Islam, Christian Arabs had already adopted this form from Syriac. According to the Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02bc\u0101n, \"Arabic often employs an initial 'ayn in words borrowed from Aramaic or Syriac and the dropping of the final Hebrew 'ayin is evidenced in the form Yisho of the 'koktiirkish' Manichaean fragments from Turfan.\" This is supported by Mac\u00fach with an example in classical Mandaic, a variety of Eastern Aramaic (hence closely related to Syriac) used as liturgical language by the Mandaean community of southern Mesopotamia, where the name for Jesus is rendered \u02bf-\u0161-u (\u084f\u0854\u0845), though the pharyngeal ('ayin) is pronounced like a regular long i (\"\u012ashu\"). Also the name Yeshu (\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5 in Hebrew and Aramaic) lacking the final 'ayin is also used to refer to Jesus in the Jewish work the Toledot Yeshu, and scholar David Flusser presents evidence Yeshu was also a name itself rather than claims it was meant to supposedly be an acronym to insult Jesus. The Brill Encyclopedia of the Qur'an notes scholar Anis al-Assiouty as noting the fact that \"In the Talmud, however, he (Jesus) is called Yeshu.\" Scholar David Flusser and other scholars like Adolf Neubauer, Hugh J. Schonfield, and Joachim Jeremias also further argued that the name or pronunciation Yeshu (\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5 in Hebrew and Aramaic) could also be \"the Galilean pronunciation\" of Yeshua' that came about because of an inability to pronounce the 'ayin in the Galilee region where Jesus came from. Scholar Alphonse Mingana writes there may have been a monastery named \u02bf\u012as\u0101niyya  in the territory of the Christian Ghassanid Arabs in southern Syria as early as 571 CE.\n\nParagraph 19: Another explanation given is that in ancient Mesopotamia divine names were written in one way and pronounced in another.

Spencer took a 6\u20132 lead, before Owen levelled the match at 6\u20136, having made the first day's highest break of 80 in the 9th frame. The Birmingham Daily Post correspondent praised the players for bringing a \"refreshing new look to the game, with bold attacking play, wonderful potting, and a sprinkling of good-sized breaks\". On the second day, both players missed easy , sharing the first two frames for 7\u20137 before Spencer won the next four frames to lead 11\u20137 by the interval, after which he added four of the subsequent six frames to increase his advantage to six frames at 15\u20139. The third day's play, which featured only two breaks of 50 or more, was described in the Coventry Evening Telegraph as \"undistinguished\", and ended with Spencer still six frames ahead, at 21\u201315. On day 4, Owen won four of the afternoon session's six frames to close to 19\u201323. In the evening session, Spencer claimed the first three frames, and finished the day six frames ahead again at 27\u201321. Owen only won three of the twelve frames on the fifth day, leaving Spencer one frame from victory at 36\u201324. Owen's brother Marcus Owen, a former English Amateur Championship winner, commented that \"Gary's cueing is all over the place. Every time he plays a forcing shot, his whole body is moving.\" Spencer took the first frame on the final day to claim victory by achieving a winning margin of 37\u201324. The remaining 12 dead frames were played, with Spencer finishing 46\u201327 ahead. With this he became the first player to win the World Championship at his first attempt since Joe Davis at the inaugural championship in 1927. Owen compiled a 100 break, the highest of the match, in the 66th frame after the title had been decided.\n\nParagraph 21: Don Hayes, lead guitar player, was born in Fairmont, West Virginia in January 1950. He was the second of ten children in his family and he was raised in the small community of Whitehall, WV, outside of Fairmont for seven years until he was moved to the outskirts of Akron, Ohio. Living in the village of Canal Fulton for most of his early years, he graduated from Northwest High School in 1968. Don was an avid athlete in his younger days, he could usually be found hard at a game of baseball or basketball. If the chores were done and there wasn't a game in the works, he could usually be found beating on an old hollow body electric guitar a neighbor had given him. That beater served him well until his parents got him a new solid body Silvertone guitar, which became his mainstay for two or three years. Don grew up listening to just about every kind of music, but snuck in as much Rock & Roll as he could. His favorite guitarists and idols in those years were undoubtedly Don Rich and Duane Eddy. Don started playing in his first band around 16 years of age, \"Don & Jerry & the Ghost Riders\".  Don and two other members of the band wrote most of the music for the band, if they weren't playin' a gig, he could usually be found playing with his father's country band. Over the years he played in several cover bands; the two most notable were Dave Cutting and the \"Nimissilla Creek Band\" and Dave Cutting and the \"Coyote Junction Band\". He also played in three different bands during his tour of duty in Germany with the US Army.  Even though he thought he had retired from playing in bands when he moved to Kentucky in 2002, KBCB kept the pressure on and after several attempts to get him to go to a KBCB practice, he was finally persuaded to attend one. Don was immediately impressed with the fact that KBCB did mostly original material, and with the message left on his answering machine by the band before he even had a chance to return home the evening of that first jam session, a bond of friendship was made that became the history of KBCB. Now every new step is only a new chapter in that history as Don continues to reinvent himself each step of the way.\n\nParagraph 22: The economist George Dalton, through surveying agrarian peasant economies in areas of West Africa, suggests that in societies where peasant economics is the predominant form of production, those societies generally consist of a community of family units. Dalton defines this community as \u201ca circle of people who live together\u2026 so that they share not this or that particular interest, but a whole set of interests wide enough and comprehensive enough to include their lives.\u201d  These communities largely produce for their own subsistence, as opposed to producing for markets. The production processes that occur in these societies center around this subsistence, and the organization of this society into a communal form of production. As Dalton writes of African peasant communities, unemployment and economic depression are not the main issues. Instead, these societies primarily have to contend with issues within the environment, like the weather and plant diseases.  Peasants are also less likely to be specialists in a particular area of production and will spend time across the year doing a wide range of productive activities. Dalton also argued that peasant societies based their economic production much more on cultural and religious tradition, as opposed to purely environmental conditions. He based this on a study of neighboring African peasant societies which had very different cultural practices and social structures. They would have extremely similar environmental conditions and yet would have very different economies, which he argued demonstrated that social structure and culture were the primary determining factors of the economic activity of peasant societies.  Dalton also argued that this is demonstrated in the distribution of the factors of production in peasant societies. Unlike market economies where land, labour, and materials are purchased, in African peasant societies \u201cland for homesteads and farms is acquired through tribal affiliation or kinship right.\u201d  Alongside this, Dalton suggests that much of the organization of work would occur through social relationships within the community, such as \u201ckinship and friendship reciprocity.\u201d He concludes that this largely social and cultural organization of production is due to relative absence of the pressure of market economies to reduce costs and maximize profits, which would \u201cenforce economizing decisions on local producers.\u201d Dalton also argues that peasant societies were generally based on a socially guaranteed subsistence, with reciprocal gifts of produce, materials and livestock based on tribal and social relationships.  These gifts would exchange between members of a particular tribe and would also involve tribute to the chief of the tribe, who would act as a steward of the society, and would maintain a retinue of warriors. These chiefs would also resolve conflicts between tribe members and provide emergency resources. The chief could also call upon members of the tribe to perform labour in service to them, like constructing their huts. \n\nParagraph 23: Another explanation given is that in ancient Mesopotamia divine names were written in one way and pronounced in another.

He went to Virginia for a year to be a private tutor and to study law.  When he returned to Fairfield he continued his studies and was admitted to the bar in 1807. That same year he married Sarah Bradley. He received a Master of Arts, in 1808 from Yale. Their only child, Jabez Huntington Tomlinson, was born in 1818 but died at the young age of 19 in 1838.  Mrs. Tomlinson died in 1842. In 1846, Gideon married Mrs. Lydia Ann Wells Wright, widow of William Wright of Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nParagraph 25: Catana or Catina (Catania) was conquered at the beginning of the First Punic War, in 263 BC, by the Consul Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla. Part of the booty from the conquest was a sundial which was set up in the Comitium in Rome. Additionally the city was required to pay tribute to Rome (civitas decumana). The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus built a gymnasium in the city. Around 135 BC, in the course of the First Servile War, the city was conquered by the rebel slaves. Another revolt in the area, led by the gladiator Seleurus in 35 BC, was probably suppressed after the death of its leader. In 122 BC, following volcanic activity on Etna, there was heavy damage from the volcanic ash raining down on the roofs of the city which collapsed under the weight. The territory of Catina was further impacted by eruptions in 50, 44, 36 BC and finally by the disastrous lava flow of 32 BC, which ruined the countryside and the city of Aitna, as well as the disastrous war between Augustus and Sextus Pompey, but with the beginning of the Augustan period, a long and difficult socio-economic recovery began. At the end of the war, all Sicily is described as heavily damaged, impoverished, and depopulated in a wide range of areas. In book 6 of Strabo in particular there is reference to the deleterious state of Syracuse, Catania, and Centuripe. After the war against Sextus Pompey, Augustus established a colonia in Catania. Pliny the Elder lists the city, which the Romans called Catina among the cities which Augustus promoted to the rank of Colonia Romana in 21 BC, along with Syracuse and Thermae (Sciacca). Groups of veterans of the Roman army were settled in the cities which had received this new status. The new demographic situation certainly contributed to change the style of municipal life in favour of the new \"Middle Class.\" Catania retained a notable importance and wealth in the course of the late Republic and the Empire: Cicero calls it the \"richest\" of the cities and it must have remained thus in the later Imperial period and Byzantine times, as the literary sources and numerous contemporary monuments suggest, which makes the city almost unique among those of Roman Sicily. In order to pay the stipendium, the large coastal cities like Catania, extended their control in the course of the High Empire, over a vast swath of the interior of the island which had become depopulated as a result of the large estates which dominated agriculture in the period. Christianity spread rapidly; among the martyrs during the persecutions of Decius and Diocletian, were Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, and Euplius. The Diocese of Catania was established at the end of the 6th century.\n\nParagraph 26: Catana or Catina (Catania) was conquered at the beginning of the First Punic War, in 263 BC, by the Consul Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla.

After entering the state of Mississippi in late April 1863, Major General Ulysses S. Grant of the Union Army moved his force inland to strike at the strategic Mississippi River town of Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Battle of Raymond, which was fought on May 12, convinced Grant that General Joseph E. Johnston's Confederate army was too strong to be safely bypassed, so he sent two corps, under Major Generals James B. McPherson and William T. Sherman, to capture Johnston's position at Jackson. Johnston did not believe the city was defensible and began withdrawing. Brigadier General John Gregg was tasked with commanding the Confederate rear guard, which fought Sherman's and McPherson's men at Jackson on May 14 before withdrawing. After taking the city, Union troops destroyed economic and military infrastructure and also plundered civilians' homes. Grant then moved against Vicksburg, which he placed under siege on May 18 and captured on July 4. Despite being reinforced, Johnston made only a weak effort to save the Vicksburg garrison, and was driven out of Jackson a second time in mid-July.\n\nParagraph 29: Ordered to Baltimore, Maryland, April 1862.

Linda leaves Ava who she feels seduced her dad from the Faerie and had kept this fact from her. Linda goes back to Verian who reveals that he is also from the Faerie and explains how cold iron kills fairy. He also tells her that the hot iron in human blood is poison too, but a changelings blood takes the edge of it and mixing it with charmed heroin is what gives it the kick. Linda makes love to Verian, who later on tries to make a hit using her father's christening spoon which he drops, as it is made of iron. The Puck then comes to Verian's room with a bag of heroin and tells Linda that he saw Death go in the corridor and she was with Linda's friend. Linda rushes to the next room to see that Jeffrey has overdosed. Linda makes a brief visit to the dreaming where she meets Lucius, Nuala and The Sandman. She also sees Jeff in a grotesque collection of dead souls which is later revealed as Mabs' heart. When she wakes up she sees Queen Titania who carries her home, where she meets Ava, and reveals that Ava was exiled from faerie, which surprises Linda who had believed it was her dad. Titania also reveals how Mab escaped. Mab who was imprisoned in her cell gave each one who visited her a piece of her heart without their knowing. Then when the fairy were killed it released the fragment of Mab which came together, and Linda realises it is the Red Horse drug that kills the fairy. Titania calls on Linda to fulfill the oath she had made to Cluracan. Ava also comes along to protect her daughter, and it revealed that Ava is the architect of the palace. Ava releases all the faerie who have been trapped by Mab. There is a fight between these faerie and the faerie who are allied with Mab. Linda injects herself with Red Horse, which she mixes with her fathers christening spoon and she is bound to Mab's heart which Titania wants to pull down and destroy. Mab arrives on the scene and interrupts them. Ava uses her mastery of the palace to trap Mab under a pillar and both she and Titania aim their bows to Mab's heart but their arrows are prevented from meeting their target by the Puck. Mab who says she spared Titania because she feared her death curse chokes Ava and Titania  with the strings of their bows thereby preventing them from speaking.\n\nParagraph 31: During the normal cycle of respiration, a single breath can be divided into two phases: inspiration and expiration. At the beginning of inspiration, the lungs expand and  free gasses fill the lungs. As the alveoli are filled with this new gas, the concentration of  that fills the alveoli is dependent on the ventilation of the alveoli and the perfusion (blood flow) that is delivering the  for exchange. Once expiration begins to occur, the lung volume decreases as air is forced out the respiratory tract. The volume of  that is exhaled at the end of exhalation is generated as a by product of metabolism from tissue throughout the body. The delivery of  to the alveoli for exhalation is dependent on an intact cardiovascular system to ensure adequate blood flow from the tissue to the alveoli. If cardiac output (the amount of blood that is pumped out of the heart) is decreased, the ability to transport  is also decreased which is reflected in a decreased expired amount of . The relationship of cardiac output and end tidal  is linear, such that as cardiac output increases or decreases, the amount of  is also adjusted in the same manner. Therefore the monitoring of end tidal  can provide vital information on the integrity of the cardiovascular system, specifically how well the heart is able to pump blood.\n\nParagraph 32: Asa Earl Carter (September 4, 1925 \u2013 June 7, 1979) was a 1950s segregationist speech writer, and later Western novelist. He co-wrote George Wallace's well-known pro-segregation line of 1963, \"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\", and ran in the Democratic primary for governor of Alabama on a segregationist ticket. Years later, under the alias of supposedly Cherokee writer Forrest Carter, he wrote The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales (1972), a Western novel that led to a 1976 film featuring Clint Eastwood that was adopted into the National Film Registry, and The Education of Little Tree (1976), a best-selling, award-winning book which was marketed as a memoir but which turned out to be fiction.\n\nParagraph 33: New York Avenue was planned as one of the original streets in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C.  It was intended to begin at the Potomac River and extend northeast toward the White House, then continue past the Executive Residence northeast to the boundary of the Federal City. The portion of the street southwest of the White House was to give the President of the United States an uninterrupted view of the river. Construction of the State, War, and Navy Building from 1871 to 1888 blocked this view, and it remains blocked to this day. Originally, it extended to the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the construction of Rawlins Park in 1873 destroyed a block of New York Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets NW. Its consolidation with Triangle Park and three other \"parklets\" into a \"Little Mall\" (in apparent imitation of the nearby National Mall) in 1937 consumed another block between 20th and 21st Streets NW. Construction of the United States Department of War Building (now the Harry S Truman Building, housing the United States Department of State), and an associated park (since January 1959, known as Edward J. Kelly Park) from 1940 to 1941 destroyed the lower three blocks of New York Avenue. Construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Building (which now houses the United States Office of Personnel Management) in 1963 eliminated another block between 19th and 20th Streets NW.  This left a single block of New York Avenue NW, between 17th and 18th Streets NW, southeast of the White House.\n\nParagraph 34: If a small freight or commuter railroad does not operate on another railroad territory, then there is no interoperability-based reason that obligates them to use  spectrum to implement PTC. In addition, if a small freight or commuter railroad only operates on their own territory and hosts other guest railroads (freight or other passenger rail), there is still no interoperability-based reason the host is obliged to use  spectrum to implement PTC. Such a railroad could implement PTC by freely picking any radio spectrum and requiring the guest railroads to either install compliant PTC equipment (including radios) on board their trains or provide wayside equipment for their guest PTC implementation to be installed on the host railroad property. An interesting case that highlights some of these issues is the northeast corridor. Amtrak operates services on two commuter rail properties it does not own: Metro-North Railroad (owned by New York and Connecticut) and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) (owned by Massachusetts). In theory, Amtrak could have found themselves installing their own PTC system on these host properties (about 15 percent of the corridor), or worse, found themselves in the ridiculous position of trying to install three different PTC systems on each Amtrak train to traverse the commuter properties. This was not the case. Amtrak had a significant head start over the commuter rail agencies on the corridor in implementing PTC. They spent a considerable amount of time in research and development and won early approvals for their ACSES system on the northeast corridor with the FRA. They chose first to use  and then later moved to , in part because of a perceived improvement in radio-system performance and in part because Amtrak was using  in Michigan for their ITCS implementation.  When the commuter agencies on the corridor looked at options for implementing PTC, many of them chose to take advantage of the advance work Amtrak had done and implement the ACSES solution using . Amtrak's early work paid off and meant that they would be traversing commuter properties that installed the same protocol at the same frequency, making them all interoperable. (Actually most of the Northeast Corridor is owned and operated by Amtrak, not the commuter properties, including the tracks from Washington, D.C. to New York Penn Station and the tracks from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The State of Massachusetts owns the tracks from the Rhode Island state line to the New Hampshire state line, but Amtrak \"operates\" these lines. Only the line between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut is actually owned and operated by a commuter line.)\n\nParagraph 35: The first article of the agreement stated that The Government of Sinkiang agrees to extend to the Government of the USSR within the territory of Sinkiang exclusive rights to prospect for, investigate and exploit tin mines and its ancillary minerals. The USSR established a trust known as Sin-Tin as an independent juridical person subject only to legislative procedures of the USSR for implementation of the provisions of the agreement on Concessions in accordance with Article 4 with the right to establish without hindrance branch offices, sub-branch offices and agencies within the whole territory of Sinkiang with all supplies of needs of concessions, deliveries of equipment and materials and other imports from USSR and exports of minerals from Sinkiang free of custom duties and other imposts and taxes and payment of a fixed price of five percent of the cost of mined minerals to the Xinjiang Government. Article 5 stated that  During the period of validity of the present Agreement, the Government of Sinkiang shall guarantee the acquisition of lands, including the felling of timbers, the mining of coal and areas for the procurement of building materials, which may be necessary for the carrying on of the various kinds of works referred to in this Agreement. The Government of Sinkiang shall remove all the population residing in such areas as may have been allotted to Sin-tin. The Agreement granted USSR the right to seize land allotted to Sin-tin in any area of Xinjiang because Article 5 stated that  such areas of land shall be allotted on the application of Sin-tin. In the allotment of such areas of land, there shall be no delay and shall be in strict conformity with the terms of the application. The rental for such allotted areas shall be paid with the products of Sin-tin as provided for in Article 7 Following this agreement on Concessions, large-scale geological exploration expeditions were sent by the Soviets to Xinjiang in 1940 to 1941 and large deposits of uranium, beryllium and other minerals were found in the mountains near Kashgar and in the Altai region. Ores of both minerals continued to be delivered from Xinjiang Altai mines to the USSR until the end of 1949. Soviet geologists continued to work in Xinjiang until 1955, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev refused Mao Zedong's demand to hand over the technology to produce PRC nuclear weapons. A Chinese atomic project was initiated using facilities built by the Soviet Union in Chuguchak and Altai in Northern Xinjiang. These facilities were used by the Soviet Union for nuclear weapon design and the creation of the first Soviet atomic bomb, successfully tested in the USSR on 29 August 1949.\n\nParagraph 36: Ordered to Baltimore, Maryland, April 1862.

Early March 2000, MP Femke Halsema (GreenLeft) called for discussion on abolishing the monarchy, because according to her 'the time is ripe', and she pleaded for the establishment of a parliamentary republic after the German model. Even though an elected head of state was in the election programme of GreenLeft, fraction leader Paul Rosenm\u00f6ller said he found it 'no urgent matter'. D66 leader Thom de Graaf, opining in April 2000 that there was not enough momentum for a republic, instead presented a plan for a 'modern kingship' as an alternative: the king should be 'at a distance, but have authority', comparable to the German president. According to him, the king's membership of the government, chairmanship of the Council of State, role as initiator of the formation and signer of laws was 'outdated', but De Graaf was also against a completely ceremonial Swedish model. GreenLeft, including both Halsema and Rosenm\u00f6ller, backed De Graaf. The response from the PvdA, which at the time stated in its party platform that the royal house should be replaced by an elected head of state, was disunited: Prime Minister Wim Kok was open to discussion, but said he did not intend to 'change anything about the head of state's constitutional position', as did former Queen's Commissioner Roel de Wit and MP Peter Rehwinkel; other PvdA members such as senator Erik Jurgens spoke in favour of modernisation, still others went a step further and advocated for a republic, such as senator Willem Witteveen, party ideologue Paul Kalma and professor Maarten Hajer. A TNS NIPO survey showed that 27% of the population agreed with De Graaf's plea for modernisation, whilst 67% opposed changing the kingship, and 6% wanted an even stronger kingship. In total, 90% wanted to maintain the monarchy, although 44% agreed with Halsema that hereditary succession was 'outdated'; however, another 44% did not see hereditary succession as a problem at all. On 9 May, De Graaf requested the government to produce a memorandum about the modernisation of the kingship, in which D66 was supported by the PvdA, the SP and GreenLeft (together 75 MPs, 50%). However, the VVD, the CDA and the small Christian fractions (also 75 MPs combined) did not feel the need for a memorandum (although they would not block a discussion on the topic), and Prime Minister Kok said he would only discuss his views on modernisation of the monarchy during his explanation of the General Affairs's budget on Prinsjesdag. On Prinsjesdag 2000, Kok made no proposals to the effect of amending the kingschap; he merely suggested that after elections, Parliament itself could host a consultative debate on who should be appointed informateur, but the eventual choice would remain a royal privilege. D66 responded with disappointment. In November 2000, a tight majority of the D66 party congress backed De Graaf's proposal, whilst over a third of the members voted for a republic.\n\nParagraph 38: New York Avenue was planned as one of the original streets in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C.

Dalton defines this community as \u201ca circle of people who live together\u2026 so that they share not this or that particular interest, but a whole set of interests wide enough and comprehensive enough to include their lives.\u201d  These communities largely produce for their own subsistence, as opposed to producing for markets. The production processes that occur in these societies center around this subsistence, and the organization of this society into a communal form of production. As Dalton writes of African peasant communities, unemployment and economic depression are not the main issues. Instead, these societies primarily have to contend with issues within the environment, like the weather and plant diseases.  Peasants are also less likely to be specialists in a particular area of production and will spend time across the year doing a wide range of productive activities. Dalton also argued that peasant societies based their economic production much more on cultural and religious tradition, as opposed to purely environmental conditions. He based this on a study of neighboring African peasant societies which had very different cultural practices and social structures. They would have extremely similar environmental conditions and yet would have very different economies, which he argued demonstrated that social structure and culture were the primary determining factors of the economic activity of peasant societies.  Dalton also argued that this is demonstrated in the distribution of the factors of production in peasant societies. Unlike market economies where land, labour, and materials are purchased, in African peasant societies \u201cland for homesteads and farms is acquired through tribal affiliation or kinship right.\u201d  Alongside this, Dalton suggests that much of the organization of work would occur through social relationships within the community, such as \u201ckinship and friendship reciprocity.\u201d He concludes that this largely social and cultural organization of production is due to relative absence of the pressure of market economies to reduce costs and maximize profits, which would \u201cenforce economizing decisions on local producers.\u201d Dalton also argues that peasant societies were generally based on a socially guaranteed subsistence, with reciprocal gifts of produce, materials and livestock based on tribal and social relationships.  These gifts would exchange between members of a particular tribe and would also involve tribute to the chief of the tribe, who would act as a steward of the society, and would maintain a retinue of warriors. These chiefs would also resolve conflicts between tribe members and provide emergency resources. The chief could also call upon members of the tribe to perform labour in service to them, like constructing their huts. \n\nParagraph 41: In about 1580, while travelling on the continent, he had met the arch-conspirator Thomas Morgan, and he was persuaded to courier letters to Mary while she was still being held by his former master, the Earl of Shrewsbury. He also assisted the movement of priests in the Catholic Midlands. But by 1586, with Mary removed to the harsher regime of Tutbury and the consequent closing down of communications with her, Babington's role as a courier came to an end. Twice in early 1586 he received letters from France, destined for Mary, but in each case he declined to 'deal further in those affairs'. Around this time he was reportedly considering leaving England permanently and was trying to secure a passport along with his Welsh friend, Thomas Salisbury. He obtained an introduction to Robert Poley, a man with good political contacts, with a view to securing a 'licence' to go to France. Poley, unknown to Babington, was an agent for Francis Walsingham, the Secretary of State, and was under orders to infiltrate known Catholic circles. He probably intentionally failed to obtain a passport for Babington, and instead persuaded him that he, Poley, was a Catholic sympathiser and could be trusted.  It was Babington's misplaced trust of, and possibly even love for, Poley that was a large contributory factor in his eventual downfall.\n\nParagraph 42: Hector Soberon is a well known theater, film and television actor. He was born in Mexico City. He obtained a bachelor's degree as an electronic engineer and his artistic career began as a professional model in 1987. Emphasized by his discipline, Hector was awarded with the \"omni\" as the best model for pasarela and fixed photography. He filmed over 100 TV. Commercials for outstanding brands and was selected to be the only model for Hugo Boss in Mexico in that time. In 1992 begins his TV. Trajectory as an actor, working for the two mayor broadcasting companies of greater international prestige in Mexico ( Televisa and TV.Azteca ) where he participated in many series and soap operas of great success such as: \"Muchachitas\", \"Maria la del Barrio\", \"el Amor no es como lo pintan\", \"papa soltero\" and \"mi pequena traviesa\" among others. He has participated in films, like just to name a few : \"morena\", \"sexual education in brief lessons\", \"la curva del olvido\" while in the international arena he shares credits with Harvey Keitel and Miguel Sandoval in the film called \"Puerto Vallarta Squeeze\", and also \"cuento sin hadas\", \"carpem diem\". In theater his most outstanding projection came with his participation in the play \"ps. Your Cat is Dead\" sharing credits with famous actor Mr. Otto Sirgo, where they were both awarded bye the critics as revelations for the years 1997. Hector has also participated as a host for festivals like \"Acapulco Fest\" and recently participated in radio broadcasting with his own programs. In 2005 Hector decides to go one step forward with his acting career by immigrating to the United States of America, where he was very well received by the audiences after personifying a villain for the soap opera \"olvidarte jamas\" produced by Univision. Recently we saw him acting the role of a personal disease in the productions \"other people's sins\" by Telemundo. Hector is currently participating in several projects where emphasizes his passion to his career by delivering all his professionalism, and respect in every single project where he is involved.\n\nParagraph 43: On 13 November 1941, U-68 was resupplied by the auxiliary cruiser Atlantis under the command of Kapit\u00e4n zur See Bernhard Rogge. The sea state was 6 to 7 at the meeting place, Rogge and Merten decided to move the meeting place  southwest. The next day, they met again and provisions were transferred to U-68. During the following night, U-68 conducted a number of mock attacks on Atlantis for training purposes. On 23 November, U-68 received the message that Atlantis had been sunk by  while resupplying  under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Ernst Bauer. U-126 was able to rescue up 300 German sailors, including Rogge. The Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote (BdU\u2014supreme commander of the U-boat Arm) ordered , under the command of Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Johann Mohr, , under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Nicolai Clausen, and , under the command of Fregattenkapit\u00e4n Hans Eckermann, to the rescue. Two days later the survivors were transferred to the refueling ship Python. On 30 November, U-68 and UA met with Python for refueling. Immediately Merten and the crew began taking on fuel,  were transferred, as well as replenishing spent torpedoes. UA was late to arrive, unnecessarily delaying the procedure. During the refueling, a smokestack was sighted, sounding the alarms. U-68 had just finished the transfer, but the additional weight of the boat was not yet accounted for, when Python came under attack from . U-68 was not ready for combat, Merten and the crew had difficulties keeping the boat at depth. During the vital phase of the attack U-68 was oscillating between a depth of  and . Holding the boat at periscope depth was impossible. Submerged, the crew of U-68 could hear the sinking of Python. Following the first warning salvo by Dorsetshire, Pythons crew its crew had chosen to scuttle the ship to avoid unnecessary casualties.\n\nParagraph 44: If a small freight or commuter railroad does not operate on another railroad territory, then there is no interoperability-based reason that obligates them to use  spectrum to implement PTC. In addition, if a small freight or commuter railroad only operates on their own territory and hosts other guest railroads (freight or other passenger rail), there is still no interoperability-based reason the host is obliged to use  spectrum to implement PTC. Such a railroad could implement PTC by freely picking any radio spectrum and requiring the guest railroads to either install compliant PTC equipment (including radios) on board their trains or provide wayside equipment for their guest PTC implementation to be installed on the host railroad property. An interesting case that highlights some of these issues is the northeast corridor. Amtrak operates services on two commuter rail properties it does not own: Metro-North Railroad (owned by New York and Connecticut) and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) (owned by Massachusetts). In theory, Amtrak could have found themselves installing their own PTC system on these host properties (about 15 percent of the corridor), or worse, found themselves in the ridiculous position of trying to install three different PTC systems on each Amtrak train to traverse the commuter properties. This was not the case. Amtrak had a significant head start over the commuter rail agencies on the corridor in implementing PTC. They spent a considerable amount of time in research and development and won early approvals for their ACSES system on the northeast corridor with the FRA. They chose first to use  and then later moved to , in part because of a perceived improvement in radio-system performance and in part because Amtrak was using  in Michigan for their ITCS implementation.  When the commuter agencies on the corridor looked at options for implementing PTC, many of them chose to take advantage of the advance work Amtrak had done and implement the ACSES solution using . Amtrak's early work paid off and meant that they would be traversing commuter properties that installed the same protocol at the same frequency, making them all interoperable. (Actually most of the Northeast Corridor is owned and operated by Amtrak, not the commuter properties, including the tracks from Washington, D.C. to New York Penn Station and the tracks from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The State of Massachusetts owns the tracks from the Rhode Island state line to the New Hampshire state line, but Amtrak \"operates\" these lines. Only the line between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut is actually owned and operated by a commuter line.)\n\nParagraph 45: Don Hayes, lead guitar player, was born in Fairmont, West Virginia in January 1950. He was the second of ten children in his family and he was raised in the small community of Whitehall, WV, outside of Fairmont for seven years until he was moved to the outskirts of Akron, Ohio. Living in the village of Canal Fulton for most of his early years, he graduated from Northwest High School in 1968. Don was an avid athlete in his younger days, he could usually be found hard at a game of baseball or basketball. If the chores were done and there wasn't a game in the works, he could usually be found beating on an old hollow body electric guitar a neighbor had given him. That beater served him well until his parents got him a new solid body Silvertone guitar, which became his mainstay for two or three years. Don grew up listening to just about every kind of music, but snuck in as much Rock & Roll as he could. His favorite guitarists and idols in those years were undoubtedly Don Rich and Duane Eddy. Don started playing in his first band around 16 years of age, \"Don & Jerry & the Ghost Riders\".  Don and two other members of the band wrote most of the music for the band, if they weren't playin' a gig, he could usually be found playing with his father's country band. Over the years he played in several cover bands; the two most notable were Dave Cutting and the \"Nimissilla Creek Band\" and Dave Cutting and the \"Coyote Junction Band\". He also played in three different bands during his tour of duty in Germany with the US Army.  Even though he thought he had retired from playing in bands when he moved to Kentucky in 2002, KBCB kept the pressure on and after several attempts to get him to go to a KBCB practice, he was finally persuaded to attend one. Don was immediately impressed with the fact that KBCB did mostly original material, and with the message left on his answering machine by the band before he even had a chance to return home the evening of that first jam session, a bond of friendship was made that became the history of KBCB. Now every new step is only a new chapter in that history as Don continues to reinvent himself each step of the way.\n\nParagraph 46: In 1373, John brought about a new alliance against Hesse under the name: Bund der alten Minne (Alliance of the Old Love). It was actually aimed at the conquest of Driedorf, and John seems to have been the leader of the alliance. The members, mostly Sterners, now called themselves: Gesellen der alten Minne (Fellows of the Old Love). The Hessians were defeated by John at Wetzlar, who then plundered the districts of , Giessen, , , Biedenkopf, Caldern, Marburg, and others, and caused great damage to the landgrave everywhere. Perhaps it was a further consequence of this victory that John drove the Hessians out of Driedorf. The settlement of 1378 at least proves that he had regained possession of this castle and district, although there are no definite records of when this happened and how Driedorf was returned to Hesse after 1378. This much is certain: the hostilities against Landgrave Henry and his successors continued for several years after 1373. Anyone who had a dispute with Hesse could count on John\u02bcs support. John entered into a special alliance with Count John of Solms in 1375 because of the dispute between the latter and Hesse over the Lordship of Lich. Finally, under the mediation of the Hoch- und Deutschmeister Johann von Hayn and the counts of Katzenelnbogen and Sponheim, a provisional settlement was reached in Friedberg in 1377. A further reconciliation, the conditions of which were not stated, was initiated by Duke Otto\u00a0I of Brunswick-G\u00f6ttingen, and also recognised in 1378 at a personal meeting of Herman and John in Frankfurt before counts Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg and Diether\u00a0VIII of Katzenelnbogen as chosen arbitrators, that John should be left undisturbed in the castle of Driedorf and its appurtenances, that the fiefs of the lordship of Itter should be returned to him, that the castle built by Hesse at the River Dill, presumably at Hermannstein, should be dismantled, and that, contrary to custom, no toll should be taken from John\u02bcs subjects there. Landgrave Herman, however, did not want to settle down with this decision, but nevertheless promised to give John a hearing before his knights and men on the matter of Driedorf and Itter. Whether this was done is unknown. At least this did not end the dispute. As early as 1379, John joined a new alliance against Hesse, which was established in the Wetterau under the name of the Gesellschaft mit dem L\u00f6wen (Society with the Lions). The hostilities continued for more than 30\u00a0years, but with several interruptions, especially during the alliance of 1390 against the common enemy, Count John\u00a0III of Sayn-Wittgenstein, and although they ceased in 1411 by a treaty between Herman and John, they soon resumed under their sons. John also seems to have been a member of a Gesellschaft mit den H\u00f6rnern (Society with the Horns), which was also established around this time with the purpose of mutual defence and assistance.\n\nParagraph 47: Born in Stratford,  Tomlinson completed preparatory studies and graduated from Yale College in 1802.

It was intended to begin at the Potomac River and extend northeast toward the White House, then continue past the Executive Residence northeast to the boundary of the Federal City. The portion of the street southwest of the White House was to give the President of the United States an uninterrupted view of the river. Construction of the State, War, and Navy Building from 1871 to 1888 blocked this view, and it remains blocked to this day. Originally, it extended to the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the construction of Rawlins Park in 1873 destroyed a block of New York Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets NW. Its consolidation with Triangle Park and three other \"parklets\" into a \"Little Mall\" (in apparent imitation of the nearby National Mall) in 1937 consumed another block between 20th and 21st Streets NW. Construction of the United States Department of War Building (now the Harry S Truman Building, housing the United States Department of State), and an associated park (since January 1959, known as Edward J. Kelly Park) from 1940 to 1941 destroyed the lower three blocks of New York Avenue. Construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Building (which now houses the United States Office of Personnel Management) in 1963 eliminated another block between 19th and 20th Streets NW.  This left a single block of New York Avenue NW, between 17th and 18th Streets NW, southeast of the White House.\n\nParagraph 3: If a small freight or commuter railroad does not operate on another railroad territory, then there is no interoperability-based reason that obligates them to use  spectrum to implement PTC.

The British presence in the early 20th century led to the formation of political organizations as the measures brought by the British were no longer conducive for Nigerians. The old political methods practiced in Lagos was seen as no longer adequate to meet the new situation. The first of such organizations was the People's Union formed by Orisadipe Obasa and John K. Randle with the main aim of agitating against the water rate but also to champion the interests of the people of Lagos. This body became popular and attracted members of all sections of community including the Chief Imam of Lagos, as well as Alli Balogun, a wealthy Muslim. The popularity of the organization reduced after it was unable to prevent the imposition of the water rate by 1916. The organization was also handicapped by constant disagreements among the leaders. The emergence of the NCBWA and the NNDP in 1920 and 1923 respectively, led to a major loss of supporters of the People's Union, and by 1926, it had completely ceased to exist. Two years after the formation of the People's Union, another organization called The Lagos Ancillary of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society (LAARPS) came into the picture. This society was not a political organization but a humanitarian body. This organization came into existence to fight for the interest of Nigerians generally but its attention was taken up by the struggle over the land issue of 1912. In Northern Nigeria, all lands were taken over by the administration and held in trust for the people. Those in Southern Nigeria feared that this method would be introduced into the South. Educated Africans believed that if they can be successful in preventing the system from being extended to Southern Nigeria, then they can fight to destroy its practice in the North. This movement attracted personalities in Lagos amongst whom are James Johnson, Mojola Agbebi, Candido Da Rocha, Christopher Sapara Williams, Samuel Herbert Pearse, Cardoso, Adeyemo Alakija and John Payne Jackson (Editor, Lagos Weekly Record). Its delegation to London to present its views to the British government was discredited by quarrels which broke out among its members over the delegation fund. Accusations of embezzlement against some members, disagreements and quarrels, as well as the death of some of its leading members led to the untimely death of this organization before 1920. The outbreak of war and a strong political awareness led to the formation of a number of organizations. These are the Lagos Branch of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP).\n\nParagraph 8: Throughout Roosevelt's presidency, he returned to the same theme continually over the course of the New Deal. Also in the Atlantic Charter, an international commitment was made as the Allies thought about how to \"win the peace\" following victory in the Second World War. The US' commitment to non-interventionism in World War II ending with the 1941 Lend-Lease act, and later Pearl Harbor attacks, resulted in the mobilisation of the war state. The generous terms of the act, in conjunction with the economic growth of the US were key in allowing the US to establish new global order with the help of Allied powers in the aftermath of war. This motivation to establish a new global order provided the infrastructure for the implementation of an international standard of human rights, seen with the Second Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Akira Iriye's proposition that the US desired to transform the post war Pacific after their own image is representative of the wider desire to raise global standards to that of the US, feeding into ideals of American Exceptionalism. The effect of wider democratisation and social reform is divulged upon in Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man.\n\nParagraph 9: MBC Action (stylized as MBCACTION) is a free-to-air television channel that MBC Group\u2019s action-packed channel that targets young Arabic males.

Also known as the Grim Reaper, he is feared by the NOL for being the most powerful individual to have ever rebelled against them since the Ikaruga Civil War. His actions, which included destroying countless numbers of their branches, have labeled him the most wanted criminal and caused him to receive the largest bounty ever in the history of the NOL. He possesses a powerful form of ars magus called the Azure Grimoire, or simply referred to as the titular BlazBlue, which is often either the secondary or primary target of those after him and his bounty. His ultimate goal is to destroy the NOL, for he blames them for destroying his family. He is Jin Kisaragi's biological brother, whose rivalry with him stems from an incident that happened when their sister Saya was presumably killed. His right arm is mechanical because his real one was cut off by Terumi, who had taken control of Jin's mind. He was resurrected by Rachel as a dhampir, causing one of his green eyes to turn red and his once-blond hair to white. The BlazBlue he possesses is only a fragment of an imitation; the true Grimoire is actually destined to be wielded by Noel Vermillion. In Continuum Shift, Ragna is given the Idea Engine by a dying Lambda which enabled him to access the true Azure. He realizes that Saya is possessed by Izanami and decides to give up vengeance to protect his loved ones in Chrono Phantasma, and later in Central Fiction decides to protect the girl inside Amaterasu from the Entitled-people whose dreams are strong enough to remake the world. He and Jin (including his future-past counterpart Hakumen) soon learned that Noel/Mu can be used to recreate Saya, whose soul remains in her old body, possessed by Izanami. Once Noel and Mu merge, he helps Noel merge with Izanami and imprison her into her soul, recreating Saya. With the help of Jin and Trinity after Ragna separates the Susano'o armor from Terumi, Jin transports Ragna and Terumi to the Azure void where Ragna can kill him for good. Once all evils are finished, and after helping Noel merge with the Origin to free her from the Amaterasu Unit, Ragna's last act is to cast himself into the cauldron and remain outside the world, to make sure the Azure never falls into the wrong hands. As this act would erase himself from the memories of everybody in the story, he says goodbye to his beloved siblings and tells Amane that he has no regrets at all. Ragna disappears and leaves only his sword behind, which is later put to the hill where it is placed on a hill near Celica's church as a makeshift grave. Whether or not Ragna is truly unable to return to the world is unknown, as the final scene shows that his sword has been taken by somebody. He is also hinted not to be a natural-born human due to his unusual features, an idea that is confirmed in the final game when it is revealed he is the child of the fifth Prime Field Device. Ragna's weapon is called Blood-Scythe (\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba Buraddo Saizu), a giant sword that can extend into a scythe. His Drive, Soul Eater, enables him to absorb a portion of the damage dealt to replenish his health.\n\nParagraph 11: In 1373, John brought about a new alliance against Hesse under the name: Bund der alten Minne (Alliance of the Old Love).

Whether this was done is unknown. At least this did not end the dispute. As early as 1379, John joined a new alliance against Hesse, which was established in the Wetterau under the name of the Gesellschaft mit dem L\u00f6wen (Society with the Lions). The hostilities continued for more than 30\u00a0years, but with several interruptions, especially during the alliance of 1390 against the common enemy, Count John\u00a0III of Sayn-Wittgenstein, and although they ceased in 1411 by a treaty between Herman and John, they soon resumed under their sons. John also seems to have been a member of a Gesellschaft mit den H\u00f6rnern (Society with the Horns), which was also established around this time with the purpose of mutual defence and assistance.\n\nParagraph 12: Keats introduced four new projects in 2010. In January he created a pinhole camera intended to take a single 100-year-long exposure. Printed in Good Magazine, the simple box camera was designed to be cut out, folded, and glued together, and then left to take a picture which the magazine promised to publish in a \"special folio\" as part of the January 2110 issue. In February, Keats expanded his filmmaking for plants into a new genre. Observing that plants aren't mobile, he produced a travel documentary \u2013 showing footage of Italian skies \u2013 which he screened for an audience of ficus and palm trees at the AC Institute in New York City through early March, and later in the year presented to an audience of mixed species, with musical accompaniment by the composer Theresa Wong, at the Berkeley Art Museum in California. He also produced an online version of the movie for viewing by plants at home, posted by Wired News Following an AFP wire story, news of the travel documentaries was reported worldwide, though not in Italy. Keats launched an alternative space agency, the Local Air and Space Administration (LASA), in October. Headquartered at California State University, Chico, the organization claimed to be taking on the exploratory role abandoned by NASA, and announced simultaneous missions to the Moon and Mars. Rather than building rockets, LASA amassed lunar and martian terrain locally in California, by pulverizing meteorites. The first LASA astronauts were potatoes grown in water mineralized with lunar anorthosite and martian shergottite, exploring the Moon and Mars by osmosis, according to Keats, who further argued that the minerals they absorbed over their month-long missions made them \"alien hybrids\". LASA also entered the space tourism business, offering humans the opportunity to explore the Moon and Mars by buying and drinking bottled lunar and martian mineral waters at an \"exotourism bureau\" in San Francisco. At the same time that he was managing the Local Air & Space Administration, Keats started independently to produce pornography for God. The source for his pornography was the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which had just begun to replicate Big Bang conditions at a small scale. Reasoning that the Big Bang was \"divine coitus\", Keats screened a live feed from the LHC on a votive altar. He opened his \"porn palace for God\" at the alternative art space Louis V. ESP in Brooklyn, New York. While Keats explained that he had become \"God's pornographer\" in order to encourage God to create additional universes since our own was doomed by cosmic expansion, worldwide opinion on the worthiness of his project was mixed.\n\nParagraph 13: Normanhurst is divided by Pennant Hills Road, a major north-south road that leads north to the M1 Motorway, and south towards Parramatta. However, both the east and west sections have extensive bush access. On the east side, a small section of bush lies between Normanhurst and Fox Valley. This is land occupied by the SAN Hospital. On the western side, the suburb backs onto the southern reaches of the Berowra Valley, a continuous section of bush stretching all the way to Broken Bay. This gives Normanhurst a very \"leafy\" and rural look. This in turn contributes to making native bird life abundant. The area is home to cockatoos, rainbow lorikeets, kookaburras, noisy miners, native brush turkeys, and powerful owls. Additionally, Normanhurst has several small waterfalls, which promote reptile and marsupial life, such as Eastern grey kangaroos, echidnas and red-bellied black snakes. It also has encouraged the growth of retirement residences in the suburb. The Hornsby Shire Historical Society and Museum is located on Kenley Road.\n\nParagraph 14: On 13 November 1941, U-68 was resupplied by the auxiliary cruiser Atlantis under the command of Kapit\u00e4n zur See Bernhard Rogge. The sea state was 6 to 7 at the meeting place, Rogge and Merten decided to move the meeting place  southwest. The next day, they met again and provisions were transferred to U-68. During the following night, U-68 conducted a number of mock attacks on Atlantis for training purposes. On 23 November, U-68 received the message that Atlantis had been sunk by  while resupplying  under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Ernst Bauer. U-126 was able to rescue up 300 German sailors, including Rogge. The Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote (BdU\u2014supreme commander of the U-boat Arm) ordered , under the command of Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Johann Mohr, , under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Nicolai Clausen, and , under the command of Fregattenkapit\u00e4n Hans Eckermann, to the rescue. Two days later the survivors were transferred to the refueling ship Python. On 30 November, U-68 and UA met with Python for refueling. Immediately Merten and the crew began taking on fuel,  were transferred, as well as replenishing spent torpedoes. UA was late to arrive, unnecessarily delaying the procedure. During the refueling, a smokestack was sighted, sounding the alarms. U-68 had just finished the transfer, but the additional weight of the boat was not yet accounted for, when Python came under attack from . U-68 was not ready for combat, Merten and the crew had difficulties keeping the boat at depth. During the vital phase of the attack U-68 was oscillating between a depth of  and . Holding the boat at periscope depth was impossible. Submerged, the crew of U-68 could hear the sinking of Python. Following the first warning salvo by Dorsetshire, Pythons crew its crew had chosen to scuttle the ship to avoid unnecessary casualties.\n\nParagraph 15: New York Avenue was planned as one of the original streets in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C.  It was intended to begin at the Potomac River and extend northeast toward the White House, then continue past the Executive Residence northeast to the boundary of the Federal City. The portion of the street southwest of the White House was to give the President of the United States an uninterrupted view of the river. Construction of the State, War, and Navy Building from 1871 to 1888 blocked this view, and it remains blocked to this day. Originally, it extended to the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the construction of Rawlins Park in 1873 destroyed a block of New York Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets NW. Its consolidation with Triangle Park and three other \"parklets\" into a \"Little Mall\" (in apparent imitation of the nearby National Mall) in 1937 consumed another block between 20th and 21st Streets NW. Construction of the United States Department of War Building (now the Harry S Truman Building, housing the United States Department of State), and an associated park (since January 1959, known as Edward J. Kelly Park) from 1940 to 1941 destroyed the lower three blocks of New York Avenue. Construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Building (which now houses the United States Office of Personnel Management) in 1963 eliminated another block between 19th and 20th Streets NW.  This left a single block of New York Avenue NW, between 17th and 18th Streets NW, southeast of the White House.\n\nParagraph 16: The  globin is thought to be a very ancient molecule, even acting as a molecular clock of sorts. It has even been used to date the separation of vertebrates and invertebrates more than 1 billion years ago. Globin enjoys a large biological distribution, not only occurring among more than 9 different phyla of animals but occurring in some fungi and bacteria as well, even being identified in nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of some leguminous plants. The isolation of the globin gene from plant root cells has suggested that the globin genes that were inherited from a common ancestor shared by plants and animals may be present in all plants.\n\nParagraph 17: Wadsley Bridge continues to develop; the Kilner Way retail park opened in the 1970s, being built on the site of an old brick works and sandstone quarry. In 2008 it underwent a complete revamp with the old buildings being pulled down and eight new large retail unit being built for shops such as Halfords and Matalan. Development in recent years has given the area at the foot of Leppings Lane a Burger King and a Carphone Warehouse, built utilising the roof of the former service station on the site. There are three public houses in Wadsley Bridge, the New Bridge Inn dates from 1833, originally the New Inn but renamed in the 1970s when the new railway bridge was constructed, the Railway and the Pheasant. Recently demolished are the Gate Inn which dated originally from 1828; it was demolished in the early 1970s when the A61 was widened and new pub put in its place, and the Travellers which dated from 1881 although parts of the building were probably much older. Both pubs were demolished in late August 2012 to make way for a Sainsbury's supermarket. Construction of the supermarket was started in May 2014 and it opened on 26 November 2014.\n\nParagraph 18: Another explanation given is that in ancient Mesopotamia divine names were written in one way and pronounced in another. Thus it is possible for borrowed words to have their consonants reversed. Another explanation is that Muhammad adopted Isa from the polemical Jewish form Esau. However, there is no evidence that the Jews have ever used Esau to refer to Jesus, and if Muhammad had unwittingly adopted a pejorative form his many Christian acquaintances would have corrected him. A fourth explanation is that prior to the rise of Islam, Christian Arabs had already adopted this form from Syriac. According to the Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02bc\u0101n, \"Arabic often employs an initial 'ayn in words borrowed from Aramaic or Syriac and the dropping of the final Hebrew 'ayin is evidenced in the form Yisho of the 'koktiirkish' Manichaean fragments from Turfan.\" This is supported by Mac\u00fach with an example in classical Mandaic, a variety of Eastern Aramaic (hence closely related to Syriac) used as liturgical language by the Mandaean community of southern Mesopotamia, where the name for Jesus is rendered \u02bf-\u0161-u (\u084f\u0854\u0845), though the pharyngeal ('ayin) is pronounced like a regular long i (\"\u012ashu\"). Also the name Yeshu (\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5 in Hebrew and Aramaic) lacking the final 'ayin is also used to refer to Jesus in the Jewish work the Toledot Yeshu, and scholar David Flusser presents evidence Yeshu was also a name itself rather than claims it was meant to supposedly be an acronym to insult Jesus. The Brill Encyclopedia of the Qur'an notes scholar Anis al-Assiouty as noting the fact that \"In the Talmud, however, he (Jesus) is called Yeshu.\" Scholar David Flusser and other scholars like Adolf Neubauer, Hugh J. Schonfield, and Joachim Jeremias also further argued that the name or pronunciation Yeshu (\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5 in Hebrew and Aramaic) could also be \"the Galilean pronunciation\" of Yeshua' that came about because of an inability to pronounce the 'ayin in the Galilee region where Jesus came from. Scholar Alphonse Mingana writes there may have been a monastery named \u02bf\u012as\u0101niyya  in the territory of the Christian Ghassanid Arabs in southern Syria as early as 571 CE.\n\nParagraph 19: Another explanation given is that in ancient Mesopotamia divine names were written in one way and pronounced in another.

Spencer took a 6\u20132 lead, before Owen levelled the match at 6\u20136, having made the first day's highest break of 80 in the 9th frame. The Birmingham Daily Post correspondent praised the players for bringing a \"refreshing new look to the game, with bold attacking play, wonderful potting, and a sprinkling of good-sized breaks\". On the second day, both players missed easy , sharing the first two frames for 7\u20137 before Spencer won the next four frames to lead 11\u20137 by the interval, after which he added four of the subsequent six frames to increase his advantage to six frames at 15\u20139. The third day's play, which featured only two breaks of 50 or more, was described in the Coventry Evening Telegraph as \"undistinguished\", and ended with Spencer still six frames ahead, at 21\u201315. On day 4, Owen won four of the afternoon session's six frames to close to 19\u201323. In the evening session, Spencer claimed the first three frames, and finished the day six frames ahead again at 27\u201321. Owen only won three of the twelve frames on the fifth day, leaving Spencer one frame from victory at 36\u201324. Owen's brother Marcus Owen, a former English Amateur Championship winner, commented that \"Gary's cueing is all over the place. Every time he plays a forcing shot, his whole body is moving.\" Spencer took the first frame on the final day to claim victory by achieving a winning margin of 37\u201324. The remaining 12 dead frames were played, with Spencer finishing 46\u201327 ahead. With this he became the first player to win the World Championship at his first attempt since Joe Davis at the inaugural championship in 1927. Owen compiled a 100 break, the highest of the match, in the 66th frame after the title had been decided.\n\nParagraph 21: Don Hayes, lead guitar player, was born in Fairmont, West Virginia in January 1950. He was the second of ten children in his family and he was raised in the small community of Whitehall, WV, outside of Fairmont for seven years until he was moved to the outskirts of Akron, Ohio. Living in the village of Canal Fulton for most of his early years, he graduated from Northwest High School in 1968. Don was an avid athlete in his younger days, he could usually be found hard at a game of baseball or basketball. If the chores were done and there wasn't a game in the works, he could usually be found beating on an old hollow body electric guitar a neighbor had given him. That beater served him well until his parents got him a new solid body Silvertone guitar, which became his mainstay for two or three years. Don grew up listening to just about every kind of music, but snuck in as much Rock & Roll as he could. His favorite guitarists and idols in those years were undoubtedly Don Rich and Duane Eddy. Don started playing in his first band around 16 years of age, \"Don & Jerry & the Ghost Riders\".  Don and two other members of the band wrote most of the music for the band, if they weren't playin' a gig, he could usually be found playing with his father's country band. Over the years he played in several cover bands; the two most notable were Dave Cutting and the \"Nimissilla Creek Band\" and Dave Cutting and the \"Coyote Junction Band\". He also played in three different bands during his tour of duty in Germany with the US Army.  Even though he thought he had retired from playing in bands when he moved to Kentucky in 2002, KBCB kept the pressure on and after several attempts to get him to go to a KBCB practice, he was finally persuaded to attend one. Don was immediately impressed with the fact that KBCB did mostly original material, and with the message left on his answering machine by the band before he even had a chance to return home the evening of that first jam session, a bond of friendship was made that became the history of KBCB. Now every new step is only a new chapter in that history as Don continues to reinvent himself each step of the way.\n\nParagraph 22: The economist George Dalton, through surveying agrarian peasant economies in areas of West Africa, suggests that in societies where peasant economics is the predominant form of production, those societies generally consist of a community of family units. Dalton defines this community as \u201ca circle of people who live together\u2026 so that they share not this or that particular interest, but a whole set of interests wide enough and comprehensive enough to include their lives.\u201d  These communities largely produce for their own subsistence, as opposed to producing for markets. The production processes that occur in these societies center around this subsistence, and the organization of this society into a communal form of production. As Dalton writes of African peasant communities, unemployment and economic depression are not the main issues. Instead, these societies primarily have to contend with issues within the environment, like the weather and plant diseases.  Peasants are also less likely to be specialists in a particular area of production and will spend time across the year doing a wide range of productive activities. Dalton also argued that peasant societies based their economic production much more on cultural and religious tradition, as opposed to purely environmental conditions. He based this on a study of neighboring African peasant societies which had very different cultural practices and social structures. They would have extremely similar environmental conditions and yet would have very different economies, which he argued demonstrated that social structure and culture were the primary determining factors of the economic activity of peasant societies.  Dalton also argued that this is demonstrated in the distribution of the factors of production in peasant societies. Unlike market economies where land, labour, and materials are purchased, in African peasant societies \u201cland for homesteads and farms is acquired through tribal affiliation or kinship right.\u201d  Alongside this, Dalton suggests that much of the organization of work would occur through social relationships within the community, such as \u201ckinship and friendship reciprocity.\u201d He concludes that this largely social and cultural organization of production is due to relative absence of the pressure of market economies to reduce costs and maximize profits, which would \u201cenforce economizing decisions on local producers.\u201d Dalton also argues that peasant societies were generally based on a socially guaranteed subsistence, with reciprocal gifts of produce, materials and livestock based on tribal and social relationships.  These gifts would exchange between members of a particular tribe and would also involve tribute to the chief of the tribe, who would act as a steward of the society, and would maintain a retinue of warriors. These chiefs would also resolve conflicts between tribe members and provide emergency resources. The chief could also call upon members of the tribe to perform labour in service to them, like constructing their huts. \n\nParagraph 23: Another explanation given is that in ancient Mesopotamia divine names were written in one way and pronounced in another.

He went to Virginia for a year to be a private tutor and to study law.  When he returned to Fairfield he continued his studies and was admitted to the bar in 1807. That same year he married Sarah Bradley. He received a Master of Arts, in 1808 from Yale. Their only child, Jabez Huntington Tomlinson, was born in 1818 but died at the young age of 19 in 1838.  Mrs. Tomlinson died in 1842. In 1846, Gideon married Mrs. Lydia Ann Wells Wright, widow of William Wright of Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nParagraph 25: Catana or Catina (Catania) was conquered at the beginning of the First Punic War, in 263 BC, by the Consul Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla. Part of the booty from the conquest was a sundial which was set up in the Comitium in Rome. Additionally the city was required to pay tribute to Rome (civitas decumana). The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus built a gymnasium in the city. Around 135 BC, in the course of the First Servile War, the city was conquered by the rebel slaves. Another revolt in the area, led by the gladiator Seleurus in 35 BC, was probably suppressed after the death of its leader. In 122 BC, following volcanic activity on Etna, there was heavy damage from the volcanic ash raining down on the roofs of the city which collapsed under the weight. The territory of Catina was further impacted by eruptions in 50, 44, 36 BC and finally by the disastrous lava flow of 32 BC, which ruined the countryside and the city of Aitna, as well as the disastrous war between Augustus and Sextus Pompey, but with the beginning of the Augustan period, a long and difficult socio-economic recovery began. At the end of the war, all Sicily is described as heavily damaged, impoverished, and depopulated in a wide range of areas. In book 6 of Strabo in particular there is reference to the deleterious state of Syracuse, Catania, and Centuripe. After the war against Sextus Pompey, Augustus established a colonia in Catania. Pliny the Elder lists the city, which the Romans called Catina among the cities which Augustus promoted to the rank of Colonia Romana in 21 BC, along with Syracuse and Thermae (Sciacca). Groups of veterans of the Roman army were settled in the cities which had received this new status. The new demographic situation certainly contributed to change the style of municipal life in favour of the new \"Middle Class.\" Catania retained a notable importance and wealth in the course of the late Republic and the Empire: Cicero calls it the \"richest\" of the cities and it must have remained thus in the later Imperial period and Byzantine times, as the literary sources and numerous contemporary monuments suggest, which makes the city almost unique among those of Roman Sicily. In order to pay the stipendium, the large coastal cities like Catania, extended their control in the course of the High Empire, over a vast swath of the interior of the island which had become depopulated as a result of the large estates which dominated agriculture in the period. Christianity spread rapidly; among the martyrs during the persecutions of Decius and Diocletian, were Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, and Euplius. The Diocese of Catania was established at the end of the 6th century.\n\nParagraph 26: Catana or Catina (Catania) was conquered at the beginning of the First Punic War, in 263 BC, by the Consul Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla.

After entering the state of Mississippi in late April 1863, Major General Ulysses S. Grant of the Union Army moved his force inland to strike at the strategic Mississippi River town of Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Battle of Raymond, which was fought on May 12, convinced Grant that General Joseph E. Johnston's Confederate army was too strong to be safely bypassed, so he sent two corps, under Major Generals James B. McPherson and William T. Sherman, to capture Johnston's position at Jackson. Johnston did not believe the city was defensible and began withdrawing. Brigadier General John Gregg was tasked with commanding the Confederate rear guard, which fought Sherman's and McPherson's men at Jackson on May 14 before withdrawing. After taking the city, Union troops destroyed economic and military infrastructure and also plundered civilians' homes. Grant then moved against Vicksburg, which he placed under siege on May 18 and captured on July 4.

Linda leaves Ava who she feels seduced her dad from the Faerie and had kept this fact from her. Linda goes back to Verian who reveals that he is also from the Faerie and explains how cold iron kills fairy. He also tells her that the hot iron in human blood is poison too, but a changelings blood takes the edge of it and mixing it with charmed heroin is what gives it the kick. Linda makes love to Verian, who later on tries to make a hit using her father's christening spoon which he drops, as it is made of iron. The Puck then comes to Verian's room with a bag of heroin and tells Linda that he saw Death go in the corridor and she was with Linda's friend. Linda rushes to the next room to see that Jeffrey has overdosed. Linda makes a brief visit to the dreaming where she meets Lucius, Nuala and The Sandman. She also sees Jeff in a grotesque collection of dead souls which is later revealed as Mabs' heart. When she wakes up she sees Queen Titania who carries her home, where she meets Ava, and reveals that Ava was exiled from faerie, which surprises Linda who had believed it was her dad. Titania also reveals how Mab escaped. Mab who was imprisoned in her cell gave each one who visited her a piece of her heart without their knowing. Then when the fairy were killed it released the fragment of Mab which came together, and Linda realises it is the Red Horse drug that kills the fairy. Titania calls on Linda to fulfill the oath she had made to Cluracan. Ava also comes along to protect her daughter, and it revealed that Ava is the architect of the palace. Ava releases all the faerie who have been trapped by Mab. There is a fight between these faerie and the faerie who are allied with Mab. Linda injects herself with Red Horse, which she mixes with her fathers christening spoon and she is bound to Mab's heart which Titania wants to pull down and destroy. Mab arrives on the scene and interrupts them. Ava uses her mastery of the palace to trap Mab under a pillar and both she and Titania aim their bows to Mab's heart but their arrows are prevented from meeting their target by the Puck. Mab who says she spared Titania because she feared her death curse chokes Ava and Titania  with the strings of their bows thereby preventing them from speaking.\n\nParagraph 31: During the normal cycle of respiration, a single breath can be divided into two phases: inspiration and expiration. At the beginning of inspiration, the lungs expand and  free gasses fill the lungs. As the alveoli are filled with this new gas, the concentration of  that fills the alveoli is dependent on the ventilation of the alveoli and the perfusion (blood flow) that is delivering the  for exchange. Once expiration begins to occur, the lung volume decreases as air is forced out the respiratory tract. The volume of  that is exhaled at the end of exhalation is generated as a by product of metabolism from tissue throughout the body. The delivery of  to the alveoli for exhalation is dependent on an intact cardiovascular system to ensure adequate blood flow from the tissue to the alveoli. If cardiac output (the amount of blood that is pumped out of the heart) is decreased, the ability to transport  is also decreased which is reflected in a decreased expired amount of . The relationship of cardiac output and end tidal  is linear, such that as cardiac output increases or decreases, the amount of  is also adjusted in the same manner. Therefore the monitoring of end tidal  can provide vital information on the integrity of the cardiovascular system, specifically how well the heart is able to pump blood.\n\nParagraph 32: Asa Earl Carter (September 4, 1925 \u2013 June 7, 1979) was a 1950s segregationist speech writer, and later Western novelist. He co-wrote George Wallace's well-known pro-segregation line of 1963, \"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\", and ran in the Democratic primary for governor of Alabama on a segregationist ticket. Years later, under the alias of supposedly Cherokee writer Forrest Carter, he wrote The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales (1972), a Western novel that led to a 1976 film featuring Clint Eastwood that was adopted into the National Film Registry, and The Education of Little Tree (1976), a best-selling, award-winning book which was marketed as a memoir but which turned out to be fiction.\n\nParagraph 33: New York Avenue was planned as one of the original streets in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C.  It was intended to begin at the Potomac River and extend northeast toward the White House, then continue past the Executive Residence northeast to the boundary of the Federal City. The portion of the street southwest of the White House was to give the President of the United States an uninterrupted view of the river. Construction of the State, War, and Navy Building from 1871 to 1888 blocked this view, and it remains blocked to this day. Originally, it extended to the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the construction of Rawlins Park in 1873 destroyed a block of New York Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets NW. Its consolidation with Triangle Park and three other \"parklets\" into a \"Little Mall\" (in apparent imitation of the nearby National Mall) in 1937 consumed another block between 20th and 21st Streets NW. Construction of the United States Department of War Building (now the Harry S Truman Building, housing the United States Department of State), and an associated park (since January 1959, known as Edward J. Kelly Park) from 1940 to 1941 destroyed the lower three blocks of New York Avenue. Construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Building (which now houses the United States Office of Personnel Management) in 1963 eliminated another block between 19th and 20th Streets NW.  This left a single block of New York Avenue NW, between 17th and 18th Streets NW, southeast of the White House.\n\nParagraph 34: If a small freight or commuter railroad does not operate on another railroad territory, then there is no interoperability-based reason that obligates them to use  spectrum to implement PTC. In addition, if a small freight or commuter railroad only operates on their own territory and hosts other guest railroads (freight or other passenger rail), there is still no interoperability-based reason the host is obliged to use  spectrum to implement PTC. Such a railroad could implement PTC by freely picking any radio spectrum and requiring the guest railroads to either install compliant PTC equipment (including radios) on board their trains or provide wayside equipment for their guest PTC implementation to be installed on the host railroad property. An interesting case that highlights some of these issues is the northeast corridor. Amtrak operates services on two commuter rail properties it does not own: Metro-North Railroad (owned by New York and Connecticut) and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) (owned by Massachusetts). In theory, Amtrak could have found themselves installing their own PTC system on these host properties (about 15 percent of the corridor), or worse, found themselves in the ridiculous position of trying to install three different PTC systems on each Amtrak train to traverse the commuter properties. This was not the case. Amtrak had a significant head start over the commuter rail agencies on the corridor in implementing PTC. They spent a considerable amount of time in research and development and won early approvals for their ACSES system on the northeast corridor with the FRA. They chose first to use  and then later moved to , in part because of a perceived improvement in radio-system performance and in part because Amtrak was using  in Michigan for their ITCS implementation.  When the commuter agencies on the corridor looked at options for implementing PTC, many of them chose to take advantage of the advance work Amtrak had done and implement the ACSES solution using . Amtrak's early work paid off and meant that they would be traversing commuter properties that installed the same protocol at the same frequency, making them all interoperable. (Actually most of the Northeast Corridor is owned and operated by Amtrak, not the commuter properties, including the tracks from Washington, D.C. to New York Penn Station and the tracks from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The State of Massachusetts owns the tracks from the Rhode Island state line to the New Hampshire state line, but Amtrak \"operates\" these lines. Only the line between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut is actually owned and operated by a commuter line.)\n\nParagraph 35: The first article of the agreement stated that The Government of Sinkiang agrees to extend to the Government of the USSR within the territory of Sinkiang exclusive rights to prospect for, investigate and exploit tin mines and its ancillary minerals. The USSR established a trust known as Sin-Tin as an independent juridical person subject only to legislative procedures of the USSR for implementation of the provisions of the agreement on Concessions in accordance with Article 4 with the right to establish without hindrance branch offices, sub-branch offices and agencies within the whole territory of Sinkiang with all supplies of needs of concessions, deliveries of equipment and materials and other imports from USSR and exports of minerals from Sinkiang free of custom duties and other imposts and taxes and payment of a fixed price of five percent of the cost of mined minerals to the Xinjiang Government. Article 5 stated that  During the period of validity of the present Agreement, the Government of Sinkiang shall guarantee the acquisition of lands, including the felling of timbers, the mining of coal and areas for the procurement of building materials, which may be necessary for the carrying on of the various kinds of works referred to in this Agreement. The Government of Sinkiang shall remove all the population residing in such areas as may have been allotted to Sin-tin. The Agreement granted USSR the right to seize land allotted to Sin-tin in any area of Xinjiang because Article 5 stated that  such areas of land shall be allotted on the application of Sin-tin. In the allotment of such areas of land, there shall be no delay and shall be in strict conformity with the terms of the application. The rental for such allotted areas shall be paid with the products of Sin-tin as provided for in Article 7 Following this agreement on Concessions, large-scale geological exploration expeditions were sent by the Soviets to Xinjiang in 1940 to 1941 and large deposits of uranium, beryllium and other minerals were found in the mountains near Kashgar and in the Altai region. Ores of both minerals continued to be delivered from Xinjiang Altai mines to the USSR until the end of 1949. Soviet geologists continued to work in Xinjiang until 1955, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev refused Mao Zedong's demand to hand over the technology to produce PRC nuclear weapons. A Chinese atomic project was initiated using facilities built by the Soviet Union in Chuguchak and Altai in Northern Xinjiang. These facilities were used by the Soviet Union for nuclear weapon design and the creation of the first Soviet atomic bomb, successfully tested in the USSR on 29 August 1949.\n\nParagraph 36: Ordered to Baltimore, Maryland, April 1862.

Early March 2000, MP Femke Halsema (GreenLeft) called for discussion on abolishing the monarchy, because according to her 'the time is ripe', and she pleaded for the establishment of a parliamentary republic after the German model. Even though an elected head of state was in the election programme of GreenLeft, fraction leader Paul Rosenm\u00f6ller said he found it 'no urgent matter'. D66 leader Thom de Graaf, opining in April 2000 that there was not enough momentum for a republic, instead presented a plan for a 'modern kingship' as an alternative: the king should be 'at a distance, but have authority', comparable to the German president. According to him, the king's membership of the government, chairmanship of the Council of State, role as initiator of the formation and signer of laws was 'outdated', but De Graaf was also against a completely ceremonial Swedish model. GreenLeft, including both Halsema and Rosenm\u00f6ller, backed De Graaf. The response from the PvdA, which at the time stated in its party platform that the royal house should be replaced by an elected head of state, was disunited: Prime Minister Wim Kok was open to discussion, but said he did not intend to 'change anything about the head of state's constitutional position', as did former Queen's Commissioner Roel de Wit and MP Peter Rehwinkel; other PvdA members such as senator Erik Jurgens spoke in favour of modernisation, still others went a step further and advocated for a republic, such as senator Willem Witteveen, party ideologue Paul Kalma and professor Maarten Hajer. A TNS NIPO survey showed that 27% of the population agreed with De Graaf's plea for modernisation, whilst 67% opposed changing the kingship, and 6% wanted an even stronger kingship. In total, 90% wanted to maintain the monarchy, although 44% agreed with Halsema that hereditary succession was 'outdated'; however, another 44% did not see hereditary succession as a problem at all. On 9 May, De Graaf requested the government to produce a memorandum about the modernisation of the kingship, in which D66 was supported by the PvdA, the SP and GreenLeft (together 75 MPs, 50%). However, the VVD, the CDA and the small Christian fractions (also 75 MPs combined) did not feel the need for a memorandum (although they would not block a discussion on the topic), and Prime Minister Kok said he would only discuss his views on modernisation of the monarchy during his explanation of the General Affairs's budget on Prinsjesdag. On Prinsjesdag 2000, Kok made no proposals to the effect of amending the kingschap; he merely suggested that after elections, Parliament itself could host a consultative debate on who should be appointed informateur, but the eventual choice would remain a royal privilege. D66 responded with disappointment. In November 2000, a tight majority of the D66 party congress backed De Graaf's proposal, whilst over a third of the members voted for a republic.\n\nParagraph 38: New York Avenue was planned as one of the original streets in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C.

Dalton defines this community as \u201ca circle of people who live together\u2026 so that they share not this or that particular interest, but a whole set of interests wide enough and comprehensive enough to include their lives.\u201d  These communities largely produce for their own subsistence, as opposed to producing for markets. The production processes that occur in these societies center around this subsistence, and the organization of this society into a communal form of production. As Dalton writes of African peasant communities, unemployment and economic depression are not the main issues. Instead, these societies primarily have to contend with issues within the environment, like the weather and plant diseases.  Peasants are also less likely to be specialists in a particular area of production and will spend time across the year doing a wide range of productive activities. Dalton also argued that peasant societies based their economic production much more on cultural and religious tradition, as opposed to purely environmental conditions. He based this on a study of neighboring African peasant societies which had very different cultural practices and social structures. They would have extremely similar environmental conditions and yet would have very different economies, which he argued demonstrated that social structure and culture were the primary determining factors of the economic activity of peasant societies.  Dalton also argued that this is demonstrated in the distribution of the factors of production in peasant societies. Unlike market economies where land, labour, and materials are purchased, in African peasant societies \u201cland for homesteads and farms is acquired through tribal affiliation or kinship right.\u201d  Alongside this, Dalton suggests that much of the organization of work would occur through social relationships within the community, such as \u201ckinship and friendship reciprocity.\u201d He concludes that this largely social and cultural organization of production is due to relative absence of the pressure of market economies to reduce costs and maximize profits, which would \u201cenforce economizing decisions on local producers.\u201d Dalton also argues that peasant societies were generally based on a socially guaranteed subsistence, with reciprocal gifts of produce, materials and livestock based on tribal and social relationships.  These gifts would exchange between members of a particular tribe and would also involve tribute to the chief of the tribe, who would act as a steward of the society, and would maintain a retinue of warriors. These chiefs would also resolve conflicts between tribe members and provide emergency resources. The chief could also call upon members of the tribe to perform labour in service to them, like constructing their huts. \n\nParagraph 41: In about 1580, while travelling on the continent, he had met the arch-conspirator Thomas Morgan, and he was persuaded to courier letters to Mary while she was still being held by his former master, the Earl of Shrewsbury. He also assisted the movement of priests in the Catholic Midlands. But by 1586, with Mary removed to the harsher regime of Tutbury and the consequent closing down of communications with her, Babington's role as a courier came to an end. Twice in early 1586 he received letters from France, destined for Mary, but in each case he declined to 'deal further in those affairs'. Around this time he was reportedly considering leaving England permanently and was trying to secure a passport along with his Welsh friend, Thomas Salisbury. He obtained an introduction to Robert Poley, a man with good political contacts, with a view to securing a 'licence' to go to France. Poley, unknown to Babington, was an agent for Francis Walsingham, the Secretary of State, and was under orders to infiltrate known Catholic circles. He probably intentionally failed to obtain a passport for Babington, and instead persuaded him that he, Poley, was a Catholic sympathiser and could be trusted.  It was Babington's misplaced trust of, and possibly even love for, Poley that was a large contributory factor in his eventual downfall.\n\nParagraph 42: Hector Soberon is a well known theater, film and television actor. He was born in Mexico City. He obtained a bachelor's degree as an electronic engineer and his artistic career began as a professional model in 1987. Emphasized by his discipline, Hector was awarded with the \"omni\" as the best model for pasarela and fixed photography. He filmed over 100 TV. Commercials for outstanding brands and was selected to be the only model for Hugo Boss in Mexico in that time. In 1992 begins his TV. Trajectory as an actor, working for the two mayor broadcasting companies of greater international prestige in Mexico ( Televisa and TV.Azteca ) where he participated in many series and soap operas of great success such as: \"Muchachitas\", \"Maria la del Barrio\", \"el Amor no es como lo pintan\", \"papa soltero\" and \"mi pequena traviesa\" among others. He has participated in films, like just to name a few : \"morena\", \"sexual education in brief lessons\", \"la curva del olvido\" while in the international arena he shares credits with Harvey Keitel and Miguel Sandoval in the film called \"Puerto Vallarta Squeeze\", and also \"cuento sin hadas\", \"carpem diem\". In theater his most outstanding projection came with his participation in the play \"ps. Your Cat is Dead\" sharing credits with famous actor Mr. Otto Sirgo, where they were both awarded bye the critics as revelations for the years 1997. Hector has also participated as a host for festivals like \"Acapulco Fest\" and recently participated in radio broadcasting with his own programs. In 2005 Hector decides to go one step forward with his acting career by immigrating to the United States of America, where he was very well received by the audiences after personifying a villain for the soap opera \"olvidarte jamas\" produced by Univision. Recently we saw him acting the role of a personal disease in the productions \"other people's sins\" by Telemundo.

The sea state was 6 to 7 at the meeting place, Rogge and Merten decided to move the meeting place  southwest. The next day, they met again and provisions were transferred to U-68. During the following night, U-68 conducted a number of mock attacks on Atlantis for training purposes. On 23 November, U-68 received the message that Atlantis had been sunk by  while resupplying  under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Ernst Bauer. U-126 was able to rescue up 300 German sailors, including Rogge. The Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote (BdU\u2014supreme commander of the U-boat Arm) ordered , under the command of Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Johann Mohr, , under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Nicolai Clausen, and , under the command of Fregattenkapit\u00e4n Hans Eckermann, to the rescue. Two days later the survivors were transferred to the refueling ship Python. On 30 November, U-68 and UA met with Python for refueling. Immediately Merten and the crew began taking on fuel,  were transferred, as well as replenishing spent torpedoes. UA was late to arrive, unnecessarily delaying the procedure. During the refueling, a smokestack was sighted, sounding the alarms. U-68 had just finished the transfer, but the additional weight of the boat was not yet accounted for, when Python came under attack from . U-68 was not ready for combat, Merten and the crew had difficulties keeping the boat at depth. During the vital phase of the attack U-68 was oscillating between a depth of  and . Holding the boat at periscope depth was impossible. Submerged, the crew of U-68 could hear the sinking of Python. Following the first warning salvo by Dorsetshire, Pythons crew its crew had chosen to scuttle the ship to avoid unnecessary casualties.\n\nParagraph 44: If a small freight or commuter railroad does not operate on another railroad territory, then there is no interoperability-based reason that obligates them to use  spectrum to implement PTC. In addition, if a small freight or commuter railroad only operates on their own territory and hosts other guest railroads (freight or other passenger rail), there is still no interoperability-based reason the host is obliged to use  spectrum to implement PTC. Such a railroad could implement PTC by freely picking any radio spectrum and requiring the guest railroads to either install compliant PTC equipment (including radios) on board their trains or provide wayside equipment for their guest PTC implementation to be installed on the host railroad property. An interesting case that highlights some of these issues is the northeast corridor. Amtrak operates services on two commuter rail properties it does not own: Metro-North Railroad (owned by New York and Connecticut) and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) (owned by Massachusetts). In theory, Amtrak could have found themselves installing their own PTC system on these host properties (about 15 percent of the corridor), or worse, found themselves in the ridiculous position of trying to install three different PTC systems on each Amtrak train to traverse the commuter properties. This was not the case. Amtrak had a significant head start over the commuter rail agencies on the corridor in implementing PTC. They spent a considerable amount of time in research and development and won early approvals for their ACSES system on the northeast corridor with the FRA. They chose first to use  and then later moved to , in part because of a perceived improvement in radio-system performance and in part because Amtrak was using  in Michigan for their ITCS implementation.  When the commuter agencies on the corridor looked at options for implementing PTC, many of them chose to take advantage of the advance work Amtrak had done and implement the ACSES solution using . Amtrak's early work paid off and meant that they would be traversing commuter properties that installed the same protocol at the same frequency, making them all interoperable. (Actually most of the Northeast Corridor is owned and operated by Amtrak, not the commuter properties, including the tracks from Washington, D.C. to New York Penn Station and the tracks from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The State of Massachusetts owns the tracks from the Rhode Island state line to the New Hampshire state line, but Amtrak \"operates\" these lines. Only the line between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut is actually owned and operated by a commuter line.)\n\nParagraph 45: Don Hayes, lead guitar player, was born in Fairmont, West Virginia in January 1950. He was the second of ten children in his family and he was raised in the small community of Whitehall, WV, outside of Fairmont for seven years until he was moved to the outskirts of Akron, Ohio. Living in the village of Canal Fulton for most of his early years, he graduated from Northwest High School in 1968. Don was an avid athlete in his younger days, he could usually be found hard at a game of baseball or basketball. If the chores were done and there wasn't a game in the works, he could usually be found beating on an old hollow body electric guitar a neighbor had given him. That beater served him well until his parents got him a new solid body Silvertone guitar, which became his mainstay for two or three years. Don grew up listening to just about every kind of music, but snuck in as much Rock & Roll as he could. His favorite guitarists and idols in those years were undoubtedly Don Rich and Duane Eddy. Don started playing in his first band around 16 years of age, \"Don & Jerry & the Ghost Riders\".  Don and two other members of the band wrote most of the music for the band, if they weren't playin' a gig, he could usually be found playing with his father's country band. Over the years he played in several cover bands; the two most notable were Dave Cutting and the \"Nimissilla Creek Band\" and Dave Cutting and the \"Coyote Junction Band\". He also played in three different bands during his tour of duty in Germany with the US Army.  Even though he thought he had retired from playing in bands when he moved to Kentucky in 2002, KBCB kept the pressure on and after several attempts to get him to go to a KBCB practice, he was finally persuaded to attend one. Don was immediately impressed with the fact that KBCB did mostly original material, and with the message left on his answering machine by the band before he even had a chance to return home the evening of that first jam session, a bond of friendship was made that became the history of KBCB. Now every new step is only a new chapter in that history as Don continues to reinvent himself each step of the way.\n\nParagraph 46: In 1373, John brought about a new alliance against Hesse under the name: Bund der alten Minne (Alliance of the Old Love). It was actually aimed at the conquest of Driedorf, and John seems to have been the leader of the alliance. The members, mostly Sterners, now called themselves: Gesellen der alten Minne (Fellows of the Old Love). The Hessians were defeated by John at Wetzlar, who then plundered the districts of , Giessen, , , Biedenkopf, Caldern, Marburg, and others, and caused great damage to the landgrave everywhere. Perhaps it was a further consequence of this victory that John drove the Hessians out of Driedorf. The settlement of 1378 at least proves that he had regained possession of this castle and district, although there are no definite records of when this happened and how Driedorf was returned to Hesse after 1378. This much is certain: the hostilities against Landgrave Henry and his successors continued for several years after 1373. Anyone who had a dispute with Hesse could count on John\u02bcs support. John entered into a special alliance with Count John of Solms in 1375 because of the dispute between the latter and Hesse over the Lordship of Lich. Finally, under the mediation of the Hoch- und Deutschmeister Johann von Hayn and the counts of Katzenelnbogen and Sponheim, a provisional settlement was reached in Friedberg in 1377. A further reconciliation, the conditions of which were not stated, was initiated by Duke Otto\u00a0I of Brunswick-G\u00f6ttingen, and also recognised in 1378 at a personal meeting of Herman and John in Frankfurt before counts Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg and Diether\u00a0VIII of Katzenelnbogen as chosen arbitrators, that John should be left undisturbed in the castle of Driedorf and its appurtenances, that the fiefs of the lordship of Itter should be returned to him, that the castle built by Hesse at the River Dill, presumably at Hermannstein, should be dismantled, and that, contrary to custom, no toll should be taken from John\u02bcs subjects there. Landgrave Herman, however, did not want to settle down with this decision, but nevertheless promised to give John a hearing before his knights and men on the matter of Driedorf and Itter. Whether this was done is unknown. At least this did not end the dispute. As early as 1379, John joined a new alliance against Hesse, which was established in the Wetterau under the name of the Gesellschaft mit dem L\u00f6wen (Society with the Lions). The hostilities continued for more than 30\u00a0years, but with several interruptions, especially during the alliance of 1390 against the common enemy, Count John\u00a0III of Sayn-Wittgenstein, and although they ceased in 1411 by a treaty between Herman and John, they soon resumed under their sons. John also seems to have been a member of a Gesellschaft mit den H\u00f6rnern (Society with the Horns), which was also established around this time with the purpose of mutual defence and assistance.\n\nParagraph 47: Born in Stratford,  Tomlinson completed preparatory studies and graduated from Yale College in 1802. He went to Virginia for a year to be a private tutor and to study law.  When he returned to Fairfield he continued his studies and was admitted to the bar in 1807. That same year he married Sarah Bradley. He received a Master of Arts, in 1808 from Yale. Their only child, Jabez Huntington Tomlinson, was born in 1818 but died at the young age of 19 in 1838.  Mrs. Tomlinson died in 1842. In 1846, Gideon married Mrs. Lydia Ann Wells Wright, widow of William Wright of Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nParagraph 48: If a small freight or commuter railroad does not operate on another railroad territory, then there is no interoperability-based reason that obligates them to use  spectrum to implement PTC.

She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano \"had nothing to do with Will's resurrection\", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release \u2013 and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave \u2013 and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive \u2013 but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 2: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton. One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton\u2019s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick\u2019s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.\n\nParagraph 3: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive.

Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488.

Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick\u2019s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.\n\nParagraph 8: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive. She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano \"had nothing to do with Will's resurrection\", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release \u2013 and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave \u2013 and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive \u2013 but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 9: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton. One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton\u2019s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton.

Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release \u2013 and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave \u2013 and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive \u2013 but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 18: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive. She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information.

One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton\u2019s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick\u2019s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.\n\nParagraph 21: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive.

However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave \u2013 and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive \u2013 but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit.

Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 28: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive.

One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton\u2019s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick\u2019s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.\n\nParagraph 31: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton.

Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence.

Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 38: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive. She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information.

One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton\u2019s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton.

Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488.

Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 9: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton. One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton\u2019s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick\u2019s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.\n\nParagraph 10: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive. She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano \"had nothing to do with Will's resurrection\", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release \u2013 and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave \u2013 and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive \u2013 but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled.

Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 19: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive. She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano \"had nothing to do with Will's resurrection\", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release \u2013 and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave \u2013 and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive \u2013 but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence.

Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 20: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton. One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton\u2019s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick\u2019s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.\n\nParagraph 21: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive.

She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano \"had nothing to do with Will's resurrection\", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release \u2013 and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave \u2013 and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive \u2013 but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 30: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton. One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton\u2019s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick\u2019s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.\n\nParagraph 31: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton.

Haliburton\u2019s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick\u2019s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.", "answers": ["2"], "pred": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,", "length": 22099, "dataset": "passage_count", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "870d882bf3ca7872472e9616aa87dc8871e722243ad4c3e9"}

Early in the morning a reinforced North Vietnamese company attacked Company B, which was manning a defensive perimeter in Vietnam. The surprise onslaught wounded 5 members of a 6-man squad caught in the direct path of the enemy's thrust. S/Sgt. Stewart became a lone defender of vital terrain\u2014virtually 1 man against a hostile platoon. Refusing to take advantage of a lull in the firing which would have permitted him to withdraw, S/Sgt. Stewart elected to hold his ground to protect his fallen comrades and prevent an enemy penetration of the company perimeter. As the full force of the platoon-sized man attack struck his lone position, he fought like a man possessed; emptying magazine after magazine at the determined, on-charging enemy. The enemy drove almost to his position and hurled grenades, but S/Sgt. Stewart decimated them by retrieving and throwing the grenades back. Exhausting his ammunition, he crawled under intense fire to his wounded team members and collected ammunition that they were unable to use. Far past the normal point of exhaustion, he held his position for 4 harrowing hours and through 3 assaults, annihilating the enemy as they approached and before they could get a foothold. As a result of his defense, the company position held until the arrival of a reinforcing platoon which counterattacked the enemy, now occupying foxholes to the left of S/Sgt. Stewart's position. After the counterattack, his body was found in a shallow enemy hole where he had advanced in order to add his fire to that of the counterattacking platoon. Eight enemy dead were found around his immediate position, with evidence that 15 others had been dragged away. The wounded whom he gave his life to protect, were recovered and evacuated. S/Sgt. Stewart's indomitable courage, in the face of overwhelming odds, stands as a tribute to himself and an inspiration to all men of his unit. His actions were in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and the Armed Forces of his country.\n\nParagraph 2: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.

Quaid is so good that his performance ends up promising what the script can't deliver - a blazing portrait of an American professional, the sunburned man of action, whose inner torment can't stop him.\" wrote Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle. Jim Lane, writing in the Sacramento News & Review, said, \"It all winds up\u2014or dribbles down\u2014to yet another chase through crowded streets in commandeered cars, with an ending meant to be ironic but simply providing a crowning howler to all the Rube Goldberg nonsense.\" He emphatically believed, \"with all the repetition and a modest 90-minute running time, they run out of ideas before they run out of film.\" Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film \"has a fractured and frustrating narrative.\" Unlike Akira Kurosawa's classic film Rashomon, which is structured around multiple retellings of the same event, LaSalle characterizes Vantage Point as \"fairly pedestrian\" and describes the multiple perspectives as \"arbitrary, a gimmick.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today said the \"various viewpoints don't quite link up\" and the concept \"seems initially intriguing, but it gets old after about the fifth time.\" She believed that like \"many action-adventure movies that are short on plot intricacies but long on gimmick and explosives, too much is given away in the trailer.\" William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed the film was \"flat-out one of the more exciting and original gut-busters that Hollywood has produced in many a month. It's virtually all action, but the action is never mindless and it is full of marvelous surprises every step of the way.\" Richard Corliss of Time said that \"Vantage Point scored with surprisingly robustness at the wickets, outperforming the predictions of industry analysts and seeming likely to be the weekend's No. 1 attraction.\" He said the film is \"best seen as straightforward, sometimes harrowing melodrama, packed with mistaken identities, beautiful villains, a kindly tourist who can outrace the bad guys, and a lost little girl whom the film brazenly sends onto a highway full of speeding cars.\" David Denby of The New Yorker said, \"Vantage Point is something remarkable\u2014the ultimate case, perhaps, of a movie as a big whirling machine.\"\n\nParagraph 4: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.

They touched down in Eielson's airplane in the first land-plane descent onto drift ice. In April 1928, Eielson and  Wilkins flew across the Arctic Ocean in the first flight from North America over the North Pole to Europe. The flight, from Point Barrow to Spitsbergen, covered  and took 20 hours. When Eielson accompanied Wilkins on an Antarctic expedition later in 1928, they became the first men to fly over both polar regions of the world in the same year.  During the Antarctic summer of 1928\u20131929, Eielson and Wilkins made air explorations of the Antarctic, charting several islands which were previously unknown.\n\nParagraph 6: Alder Gulch (alternatively called Alder Creek) is a place in the Ruby River valley, in the U.S. state of Montana, where gold was discovered on May 26, 1863, by William Fairweather and a group of men including Barney Hughes, Thomas Cover, Henry Rodgers, Henry Edgar and Bill Sweeney who were returning to the gold fields of Grasshopper Creek, Bannack, Montana. They were on their way to Yellowstone Country from Bannack but were waylaid by a band of Crow Indians. After being ordered out of Crow hunting grounds, they crossed the East Slope of the Tobacco Root Mountains and camped for the night in Elk Park, where William \"Bill\" Fairweather and Henry Edgar discovered gold, while the remaining party was out hunting for meat. Agreeing to keep the new discovery quiet the group of miners returned to the town of Bannack for supplies. However, word leaked out about the new strike, and miners followed the Fairweather party out of town. The party stopped at the Point of Rocks, part way between Bannack and Alder Gulch, and established the Fairweather Mining District in a miners meeting. It was agreed that the discoverers were entitled to two claims and first choice. The first stampede of miners reached Alder Gulch June 6, 1863, and the population swelled to over 10,000 in less than 3 months.  The \"Fourteen Mile City\" ran the length of the gulch, and included the towns of Junction City, Adobe Town, Nevada City, Central City, Virginia City, Montana, Bear Town, Highland, Pine Grove French Town, Hungry Hollow, and Summit. Upon arrival the miners lived in brush wickiups, dugouts and under overhanging rocks until cabins could be built. The first structure built in Virginia City was the Mechanical Bakery. Virginia City, and Nevada City were the centers of commerce during the height of the Alder Gulch gold rush. In the first year the area had over 10,000 people living there. Montana Territory was established in May 1864, and the first territorial capital was Bannack. The capital then moved to Virginia City, where it remained until 1875.   The Alder Gulch diggings were the richest gold placer deposits ever discovered, and in three years $30,000,000 was taken from them, with $10,000,000 taken out in the first year.  Nowadays, except during summertime, the streets of Virginia City are usually quiet and relatively few visitors find their way to the 16 ton granite monument that marks the spot of that incredible discovery of May 26, 1863.\n\nParagraph 7: The idea to create a children's hospital was born in the 1970s. At this time the Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship had the lowest rate of hospital beds per 1,000 children as well as lack of academic pediatrics. At that time, the name \"clinical pediatrics center of Bia\u0142ystok\"  was used. Efforts to start the investment were started by prof. Maria Rudobielska (head of the Institute of Pediatrics at the Medical University of Bialystok at that time). It involved the then city and voivodeship authorities, university authorities (Rector Konstanty Wi\u015bniewski) and others. As a result, on November 1, 1974, the Social Committee for the Construction of the Provincial Child Health Center in Bia\u0142ystok was established. Its main purpose was to collect social cash and work towards starting construction. The university also began to distribute donations among public institutions and organizations. During the year, PLN 6.5 million was collected from donations. In 1975, technical documentation was prepared and the location of the investment was determined. The construction works were to start in 1976, but the economic crisis in the country caused the investment to be removed from the investment plan of the Ministry of Health three times. The situation was not made easier by the fact that the university - also due to this crisis - had problems with completing the construction of the Collegium Pathologicum building at 13 Waszyngtona street. The cornerstone for the construction of the Institute of Paediatrics was finally laid during the inauguration of the academic year in 1981. While construction was planned to be completed within 3.5 years the target failed due to economic hardships in  Poland in the early 1980s and temporarily stopped. The breakthrough in the implementation of the investment happened in 1987-1990. On December 1, 1987, at the request of the then Rector of the Medical University of Bialystok, prof. Zbigniew Puchalski, the minister of health Janusz Komender appointed prof. Maciej Kaczmarski to the position of hospital director. The first stage of construction was completed on October 1, 1988. During the inauguration of the academic year 1988-1989, the Children's and Youth Outpatient Clinic was opened. Order of the Minister of Health, Izabela P\u0142aneta-Ma\u0142ecka, signed on December 22, 1988 formally established the University Children Clinical Hospital. The second stage of the investment implementation was performed by prof. Jan G\u00f3rski. Buildings which were included in the original plan and were removed due to economic constrains were re-included and built (among them the Collegium Novum building at 15a Waszyngtona Street). Finally, in 2003, after 23 years of construction, the entire investment was officially completed. The last symbolic act was the opening of the Observation and Infection Clinic. In June 2021 an agreement was signed between the hospital and Minister of Health Adam Niedzielski on a general reconstruction of the hospital with a budget of 36 million zlotych with works due to finish by June 2023. In October 2022 the Psychiatric Center was opened, co-financed by the Podlaskie Voivodeship Marshal's Office and the central Polish government, and house a new day-hospitalization department for psychiatric care. The Center was constructed at 2 Wo\u0142odyjowskiego Street, in the place of the former so-called the \"Swedish House\", which was once the seat of the hospital administration and demolished in 2017.\n\nParagraph 8: Since December 16, 2002, she was one of the news presenters at Noticias Caracol (at the time Caracol Noticias) newscast.

Shevelev. His grandfather was the Polish settler Micha\u0142 Jankowski. At an early age he began to hunt with his parents and earned a reputation for sharpshooting. He was nicknamed \"nenuni sonja\" by the local Koreans as his grand father had been called \"nenuni\" or four-eyed for his legendary skills and supposed sixth-sense while out hunting. In 1922, the family moved to northern Korea where they established Novina and Lukomorye resorts near Chongjin. When the Japanese occupied Korea, the family supplied meat to the Japanese army. Valery went to study at the Harbin Men's Gymnasium followed by studies at the Forestry College in Pyongyang. The Japanese police who knew his sharpshooting and hunting skills once showed him a photograph of a rebel hiding in the local forests and offered him a bounty of 10000 yen for his head. Valery declined due to sympathies with the locals and many years later learned that this target had been Kim Il-sung. In 1944, he moved to Manchuria and from 1945 he worked in the Soviet Army serving as a translator with knowledge of Japanese, Korean, and Russian. In 1946 he was arrested because of the family history, both as a White Russian and \"for assisting the international bourgeoisie\", since his family had supported the enemy, the Japanese army. He went to labour camp for six years, which was then extended to 10 years, and an attempt to escape led to a further extension to 25 years. During his sentence at the Gulags, he obtained through the camp management, information on his father and was able to exchange some correspondence. He was released in 1952 after which he worked in a mine in Chukotka and then at Magadan as a forester. He married Vera Maslakova (1912-1980) in Harbin in 1943, but the marriage did not last. In 1944 he married Irma Mayer (1924-1997) and they had a son Sergei. But after his arrest his wife was unable to contact him and she moved to Canada along with her son. He was rehabilitated in 1957 and he married Irina Kazimirovna Piotrovskaya (1924-2010) and moved to lived in Vladimir in 1968 after their son was born. He was in communication with his sisters Musa and Victoria who lived in the United States of America. In 1986, under Gorbachev's relaxation of rules, he was allowed to visit Canada and he met his first wife Irma and his son, then aged forty. The family also had a reunion when a statue of his grandfather was unveiled on September 15, 1991 in the village Bezverkhovo. Attendees included Valery, his son Arseny, sister Victoria, her son and two grandchildren, a grandson of Captain Fridolf Heck, and staff from the Arsenyev Museum. \n\nParagraph 16: In March 1927, Australian polar explorer George Hubert Wilkins and Eielson explored the drift ice north of Alaska.

It's virtually all action, but the action is never mindless and it is full of marvelous surprises every step of the way.\" Richard Corliss of Time said that \"Vantage Point scored with surprisingly robustness at the wickets, outperforming the predictions of industry analysts and seeming likely to be the weekend's No. 1 attraction.\" He said the film is \"best seen as straightforward, sometimes harrowing melodrama, packed with mistaken identities, beautiful villains, a kindly tourist who can outrace the bad guys, and a lost little girl whom the film brazenly sends onto a highway full of speeding cars.\" David Denby of The New Yorker said, \"Vantage Point is something remarkable\u2014the ultimate case, perhaps, of a movie as a big whirling machine.\"\n\nParagraph 18: Alder Gulch (alternatively called Alder Creek) is a place in the Ruby River valley, in the U.S. state of Montana, where gold was discovered on May 26, 1863, by William Fairweather and a group of men including Barney Hughes, Thomas Cover, Henry Rodgers, Henry Edgar and Bill Sweeney who were returning to the gold fields of Grasshopper Creek, Bannack, Montana. They were on their way to Yellowstone Country from Bannack but were waylaid by a band of Crow Indians. After being ordered out of Crow hunting grounds, they crossed the East Slope of the Tobacco Root Mountains and camped for the night in Elk Park, where William \"Bill\" Fairweather and Henry Edgar discovered gold, while the remaining party was out hunting for meat. Agreeing to keep the new discovery quiet the group of miners returned to the town of Bannack for supplies. However, word leaked out about the new strike, and miners followed the Fairweather party out of town. The party stopped at the Point of Rocks, part way between Bannack and Alder Gulch, and established the Fairweather Mining District in a miners meeting. It was agreed that the discoverers were entitled to two claims and first choice. The first stampede of miners reached Alder Gulch June 6, 1863, and the population swelled to over 10,000 in less than 3 months.  The \"Fourteen Mile City\" ran the length of the gulch, and included the towns of Junction City, Adobe Town, Nevada City, Central City, Virginia City, Montana, Bear Town, Highland, Pine Grove French Town, Hungry Hollow, and Summit. Upon arrival the miners lived in brush wickiups, dugouts and under overhanging rocks until cabins could be built. The first structure built in Virginia City was the Mechanical Bakery. Virginia City, and Nevada City were the centers of commerce during the height of the Alder Gulch gold rush. In the first year the area had over 10,000 people living there. Montana Territory was established in May 1864, and the first territorial capital was Bannack. The capital then moved to Virginia City, where it remained until 1875.   The Alder Gulch diggings were the richest gold placer deposits ever discovered, and in three years $30,000,000 was taken from them, with $10,000,000 taken out in the first year.  Nowadays, except during summertime, the streets of Virginia City are usually quiet and relatively few visitors find their way to the 16 ton granite monument that marks the spot of that incredible discovery of May 26, 1863.\n\nParagraph 19: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Early in the morning a reinforced North Vietnamese company attacked Company B, which was manning a defensive perimeter in Vietnam. The surprise onslaught wounded 5 members of a 6-man squad caught in the direct path of the enemy's thrust. S/Sgt. Stewart became a lone defender of vital terrain\u2014virtually 1 man against a hostile platoon. Refusing to take advantage of a lull in the firing which would have permitted him to withdraw, S/Sgt. Stewart elected to hold his ground to protect his fallen comrades and prevent an enemy penetration of the company perimeter. As the full force of the platoon-sized man attack struck his lone position, he fought like a man possessed; emptying magazine after magazine at the determined, on-charging enemy. The enemy drove almost to his position and hurled grenades, but S/Sgt. Stewart decimated them by retrieving and throwing the grenades back. Exhausting his ammunition, he crawled under intense fire to his wounded team members and collected ammunition that they were unable to use. Far past the normal point of exhaustion, he held his position for 4 harrowing hours and through 3 assaults, annihilating the enemy as they approached and before they could get a foothold. As a result of his defense, the company position held until the arrival of a reinforcing platoon which counterattacked the enemy, now occupying foxholes to the left of S/Sgt. Stewart's position. After the counterattack, his body was found in a shallow enemy hole where he had advanced in order to add his fire to that of the counterattacking platoon. Eight enemy dead were found around his immediate position, with evidence that 15 others had been dragged away. The wounded whom he gave his life to protect, were recovered and evacuated. S/Sgt. Stewart's indomitable courage, in the face of overwhelming odds, stands as a tribute to himself and an inspiration to all men of his unit. His actions were in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and the Armed Forces of his country.\n\nParagraph 20: In March 1927, Australian polar explorer George Hubert Wilkins and Eielson explored the drift ice north of Alaska. They touched down in Eielson's airplane in the first land-plane descent onto drift ice. In April 1928, Eielson and  Wilkins flew across the Arctic Ocean in the first flight from North America over the North Pole to Europe. The flight, from Point Barrow to Spitsbergen, covered  and took 20 hours. When Eielson accompanied Wilkins on an Antarctic expedition later in 1928, they became the first men to fly over both polar regions of the world in the same year.  During the Antarctic summer of 1928\u20131929, Eielson and Wilkins made air explorations of the Antarctic, charting several islands which were previously unknown.\n\nParagraph 21: The idea to create a children's hospital was born in the 1970s. At this time the Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship had the lowest rate of hospital beds per 1,000 children as well as lack of academic pediatrics. At that time, the name \"clinical pediatrics center of Bia\u0142ystok\"  was used. Efforts to start the investment were started by prof. Maria Rudobielska (head of the Institute of Pediatrics at the Medical University of Bialystok at that time). It involved the then city and voivodeship authorities, university authorities (Rector Konstanty Wi\u015bniewski) and others. As a result, on November 1, 1974, the Social Committee for the Construction of the Provincial Child Health Center in Bia\u0142ystok was established. Its main purpose was to collect social cash and work towards starting construction. The university also began to distribute donations among public institutions and organizations. During the year, PLN 6.5 million was collected from donations. In 1975, technical documentation was prepared and the location of the investment was determined. The construction works were to start in 1976, but the economic crisis in the country caused the investment to be removed from the investment plan of the Ministry of Health three times. The situation was not made easier by the fact that the university - also due to this crisis - had problems with completing the construction of the Collegium Pathologicum building at 13 Waszyngtona street. The cornerstone for the construction of the Institute of Paediatrics was finally laid during the inauguration of the academic year in 1981. While construction was planned to be completed within 3.5 years the target failed due to economic hardships in  Poland in the early 1980s and temporarily stopped. The breakthrough in the implementation of the investment happened in 1987-1990. On December 1, 1987, at the request of the then Rector of the Medical University of Bialystok, prof. Zbigniew Puchalski, the minister of health Janusz Komender appointed prof. Maciej Kaczmarski to the position of hospital director. The first stage of construction was completed on October 1, 1988. During the inauguration of the academic year 1988-1989, the Children's and Youth Outpatient Clinic was opened. Order of the Minister of Health, Izabela P\u0142aneta-Ma\u0142ecka, signed on December 22, 1988 formally established the University Children Clinical Hospital. The second stage of the investment implementation was performed by prof. Jan G\u00f3rski. Buildings which were included in the original plan and were removed due to economic constrains were re-included and built (among them the Collegium Novum building at 15a Waszyngtona Street). Finally, in 2003, after 23 years of construction, the entire investment was officially completed. The last symbolic act was the opening of the Observation and Infection Clinic. In June 2021 an agreement was signed between the hospital and Minister of Health Adam Niedzielski on a general reconstruction of the hospital with a budget of 36 million zlotych with works due to finish by June 2023. In October 2022 the Psychiatric Center was opened, co-financed by the Podlaskie Voivodeship Marshal's Office and the central Polish government, and house a new day-hospitalization department for psychiatric care. The Center was constructed at 2 Wo\u0142odyjowskiego Street, in the place of the former so-called the \"Swedish House\", which was once the seat of the hospital administration and demolished in 2017.\n\nParagraph 22: Yankovksy was born in the Vladivostok region to Yuri (\"George\", leading to the patronymic middle name Georgevich or Yurevich and corresponding initials G., I. or Y.) and Margarita, daughter of the shipping entrepreneur Mikhail G. Shevelev. His grandfather was the Polish settler Micha\u0142 Jankowski. At an early age he began to hunt with his parents and earned a reputation for sharpshooting. He was nicknamed \"nenuni sonja\" by the local Koreans as his grand father had been called \"nenuni\" or four-eyed for his legendary skills and supposed sixth-sense while out hunting. In 1922, the family moved to northern Korea where they established Novina and Lukomorye resorts near Chongjin. When the Japanese occupied Korea, the family supplied meat to the Japanese army. Valery went to study at the Harbin Men's Gymnasium followed by studies at the Forestry College in Pyongyang. The Japanese police who knew his sharpshooting and hunting skills once showed him a photograph of a rebel hiding in the local forests and offered him a bounty of 10000 yen for his head. Valery declined due to sympathies with the locals and many years later learned that this target had been Kim Il-sung. In 1944, he moved to Manchuria and from 1945 he worked in the Soviet Army serving as a translator with knowledge of Japanese, Korean, and Russian. In 1946 he was arrested because of the family history, both as a White Russian and \"for assisting the international bourgeoisie\", since his family had supported the enemy, the Japanese army. He went to labour camp for six years, which was then extended to 10 years, and an attempt to escape led to a further extension to 25 years. During his sentence at the Gulags, he obtained through the camp management, information on his father and was able to exchange some correspondence. He was released in 1952 after which he worked in a mine in Chukotka and then at Magadan as a forester. He married Vera Maslakova (1912-1980) in Harbin in 1943, but the marriage did not last. In 1944 he married Irma Mayer (1924-1997) and they had a son Sergei. But after his arrest his wife was unable to contact him and she moved to Canada along with her son. He was rehabilitated in 1957 and he married Irina Kazimirovna Piotrovskaya (1924-2010) and moved to lived in Vladimir in 1968 after their son was born. He was in communication with his sisters Musa and Victoria who lived in the United States of America. In 1986, under Gorbachev's relaxation of rules, he was allowed to visit Canada and he met his first wife Irma and his son, then aged forty. The family also had a reunion when a statue of his grandfather was unveiled on September 15, 1991 in the village Bezverkhovo. Attendees included Valery, his son Arseny, sister Victoria, her son and two grandchildren, a grandson of Captain Fridolf Heck, and staff from the Arsenyev Museum. \n\nParagraph 23: Since December 16, 2002, she was one of the news presenters at Noticias Caracol (at the time Caracol Noticias) newscast.

After being ordered out of Crow hunting grounds, they crossed the East Slope of the Tobacco Root Mountains and camped for the night in Elk Park, where William \"Bill\" Fairweather and Henry Edgar discovered gold, while the remaining party was out hunting for meat. Agreeing to keep the new discovery quiet the group of miners returned to the town of Bannack for supplies. However, word leaked out about the new strike, and miners followed the Fairweather party out of town. The party stopped at the Point of Rocks, part way between Bannack and Alder Gulch, and established the Fairweather Mining District in a miners meeting. It was agreed that the discoverers were entitled to two claims and first choice. The first stampede of miners reached Alder Gulch June 6, 1863, and the population swelled to over 10,000 in less than 3 months.  The \"Fourteen Mile City\" ran the length of the gulch, and included the towns of Junction City, Adobe Town, Nevada City, Central City, Virginia City, Montana, Bear Town, Highland, Pine Grove French Town, Hungry Hollow, and Summit. Upon arrival the miners lived in brush wickiups, dugouts and under overhanging rocks until cabins could be built. The first structure built in Virginia City was the Mechanical Bakery. Virginia City, and Nevada City were the centers of commerce during the height of the Alder Gulch gold rush. In the first year the area had over 10,000 people living there. Montana Territory was established in May 1864, and the first territorial capital was Bannack. The capital then moved to Virginia City, where it remained until 1875.   The Alder Gulch diggings were the richest gold placer deposits ever discovered, and in three years $30,000,000 was taken from them, with $10,000,000 taken out in the first year.  Nowadays, except during summertime, the streets of Virginia City are usually quiet and relatively few visitors find their way to the 16 ton granite monument that marks the spot of that incredible discovery of May 26, 1863.\n\nParagraph 7: The idea to create a children's hospital was born in the 1970s. At this time the Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship had the lowest rate of hospital beds per 1,000 children as well as lack of academic pediatrics. At that time, the name \"clinical pediatrics center of Bia\u0142ystok\"  was used. Efforts to start the investment were started by prof. Maria Rudobielska (head of the Institute of Pediatrics at the Medical University of Bialystok at that time). It involved the then city and voivodeship authorities, university authorities (Rector Konstanty Wi\u015bniewski) and others. As a result, on November 1, 1974, the Social Committee for the Construction of the Provincial Child Health Center in Bia\u0142ystok was established. Its main purpose was to collect social cash and work towards starting construction. The university also began to distribute donations among public institutions and organizations. During the year, PLN 6.5 million was collected from donations. In 1975, technical documentation was prepared and the location of the investment was determined. The construction works were to start in 1976, but the economic crisis in the country caused the investment to be removed from the investment plan of the Ministry of Health three times. The situation was not made easier by the fact that the university - also due to this crisis - had problems with completing the construction of the Collegium Pathologicum building at 13 Waszyngtona street. The cornerstone for the construction of the Institute of Paediatrics was finally laid during the inauguration of the academic year in 1981. While construction was planned to be completed within 3.5 years the target failed due to economic hardships in  Poland in the early 1980s and temporarily stopped. The breakthrough in the implementation of the investment happened in 1987-1990. On December 1, 1987, at the request of the then Rector of the Medical University of Bialystok, prof. Zbigniew Puchalski, the minister of health Janusz Komender appointed prof. Maciej Kaczmarski to the position of hospital director. The first stage of construction was completed on October 1, 1988. During the inauguration of the academic year 1988-1989, the Children's and Youth Outpatient Clinic was opened. Order of the Minister of Health, Izabela P\u0142aneta-Ma\u0142ecka, signed on December 22, 1988 formally established the University Children Clinical Hospital. The second stage of the investment implementation was performed by prof. Jan G\u00f3rski. Buildings which were included in the original plan and were removed due to economic constrains were re-included and built (among them the Collegium Novum building at 15a Waszyngtona Street). Finally, in 2003, after 23 years of construction, the entire investment was officially completed. The last symbolic act was the opening of the Observation and Infection Clinic. In June 2021 an agreement was signed between the hospital and Minister of Health Adam Niedzielski on a general reconstruction of the hospital with a budget of 36 million zlotych with works due to finish by June 2023. In October 2022 the Psychiatric Center was opened, co-financed by the Podlaskie Voivodeship Marshal's Office and the central Polish government, and house a new day-hospitalization department for psychiatric care. The Center was constructed at 2 Wo\u0142odyjowskiego Street, in the place of the former so-called the \"Swedish House\", which was once the seat of the hospital administration and demolished in 2017.\n\nParagraph 8: Since December 16, 2002, she was one of the news presenters at Noticias Caracol (at the time Caracol Noticias) newscast.

Shevelev. His grandfather was the Polish settler Micha\u0142 Jankowski. At an early age he began to hunt with his parents and earned a reputation for sharpshooting. He was nicknamed \"nenuni sonja\" by the local Koreans as his grand father had been called \"nenuni\" or four-eyed for his legendary skills and supposed sixth-sense while out hunting. In 1922, the family moved to northern Korea where they established Novina and Lukomorye resorts near Chongjin. When the Japanese occupied Korea, the family supplied meat to the Japanese army. Valery went to study at the Harbin Men's Gymnasium followed by studies at the Forestry College in Pyongyang. The Japanese police who knew his sharpshooting and hunting skills once showed him a photograph of a rebel hiding in the local forests and offered him a bounty of 10000 yen for his head. Valery declined due to sympathies with the locals and many years later learned that this target had been Kim Il-sung. In 1944, he moved to Manchuria and from 1945 he worked in the Soviet Army serving as a translator with knowledge of Japanese, Korean, and Russian. In 1946 he was arrested because of the family history, both as a White Russian and \"for assisting the international bourgeoisie\", since his family had supported the enemy, the Japanese army. He went to labour camp for six years, which was then extended to 10 years, and an attempt to escape led to a further extension to 25 years. During his sentence at the Gulags, he obtained through the camp management, information on his father and was able to exchange some correspondence. He was released in 1952 after which he worked in a mine in Chukotka and then at Magadan as a forester. He married Vera Maslakova (1912-1980) in Harbin in 1943, but the marriage did not last. In 1944 he married Irma Mayer (1924-1997) and they had a son Sergei. But after his arrest his wife was unable to contact him and she moved to Canada along with her son. He was rehabilitated in 1957 and he married Irina Kazimirovna Piotrovskaya (1924-2010) and moved to lived in Vladimir in 1968 after their son was born. He was in communication with his sisters Musa and Victoria who lived in the United States of America. In 1986, under Gorbachev's relaxation of rules, he was allowed to visit Canada and he met his first wife Irma and his son, then aged forty. The family also had a reunion when a statue of his grandfather was unveiled on September 15, 1991 in the village Bezverkhovo. Attendees included Valery, his son Arseny, sister Victoria, her son and two grandchildren, a grandson of Captain Fridolf Heck, and staff from the Arsenyev Museum. \n\nParagraph 16: In March 1927, Australian polar explorer George Hubert Wilkins and Eielson explored the drift ice north of Alaska.

Quaid is so good that his performance ends up promising what the script can't deliver - a blazing portrait of an American professional, the sunburned man of action, whose inner torment can't stop him.\" wrote Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle. Jim Lane, writing in the Sacramento News & Review, said, \"It all winds up\u2014or dribbles down\u2014to yet another chase through crowded streets in commandeered cars, with an ending meant to be ironic but simply providing a crowning howler to all the Rube Goldberg nonsense.\" He emphatically believed, \"with all the repetition and a modest 90-minute running time, they run out of ideas before they run out of film.\" Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film \"has a fractured and frustrating narrative.\" Unlike Akira Kurosawa's classic film Rashomon, which is structured around multiple retellings of the same event, LaSalle characterizes Vantage Point as \"fairly pedestrian\" and describes the multiple perspectives as \"arbitrary, a gimmick.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today said the \"various viewpoints don't quite link up\" and the concept \"seems initially intriguing, but it gets old after about the fifth time.\" She believed that like \"many action-adventure movies that are short on plot intricacies but long on gimmick and explosives, too much is given away in the trailer.\" William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed the film was \"flat-out one of the more exciting and original gut-busters that Hollywood has produced in many a month. It's virtually all action, but the action is never mindless and it is full of marvelous surprises every step of the way.\" Richard Corliss of Time said that \"Vantage Point scored with surprisingly robustness at the wickets, outperforming the predictions of industry analysts and seeming likely to be the weekend's No. 1 attraction.\" He said the film is \"best seen as straightforward, sometimes harrowing melodrama, packed with mistaken identities, beautiful villains, a kindly tourist who can outrace the bad guys, and a lost little girl whom the film brazenly sends onto a highway full of speeding cars.\" David Denby of The New Yorker said, \"Vantage Point is something remarkable\u2014the ultimate case, perhaps, of a movie as a big whirling machine.\"\n\nParagraph 18: Alder Gulch (alternatively called Alder Creek) is a place in the Ruby River valley, in the U.S. state of Montana, where gold was discovered on May 26, 1863, by William Fairweather and a group of men including Barney Hughes, Thomas Cover, Henry Rodgers, Henry Edgar and Bill Sweeney who were returning to the gold fields of Grasshopper Creek, Bannack, Montana. They were on their way to Yellowstone Country from Bannack but were waylaid by a band of Crow Indians. After being ordered out of Crow hunting grounds, they crossed the East Slope of the Tobacco Root Mountains and camped for the night in Elk Park, where William \"Bill\" Fairweather and Henry Edgar discovered gold, while the remaining party was out hunting for meat. Agreeing to keep the new discovery quiet the group of miners returned to the town of Bannack for supplies. However, word leaked out about the new strike, and miners followed the Fairweather party out of town.

Early in the morning a reinforced North Vietnamese company attacked Company B, which was manning a defensive perimeter in Vietnam. The surprise onslaught wounded 5 members of a 6-man squad caught in the direct path of the enemy's thrust. S/Sgt. Stewart became a lone defender of vital terrain\u2014virtually 1 man against a hostile platoon. Refusing to take advantage of a lull in the firing which would have permitted him to withdraw, S/Sgt. Stewart elected to hold his ground to protect his fallen comrades and prevent an enemy penetration of the company perimeter. As the full force of the platoon-sized man attack struck his lone position, he fought like a man possessed; emptying magazine after magazine at the determined, on-charging enemy. The enemy drove almost to his position and hurled grenades, but S/Sgt. Stewart decimated them by retrieving and throwing the grenades back. Exhausting his ammunition, he crawled under intense fire to his wounded team members and collected ammunition that they were unable to use. Far past the normal point of exhaustion, he held his position for 4 harrowing hours and through 3 assaults, annihilating the enemy as they approached and before they could get a foothold. As a result of his defense, the company position held until the arrival of a reinforcing platoon which counterattacked the enemy, now occupying foxholes to the left of S/Sgt. Stewart's position. After the counterattack, his body was found in a shallow enemy hole where he had advanced in order to add his fire to that of the counterattacking platoon. Eight enemy dead were found around his immediate position, with evidence that 15 others had been dragged away. The wounded whom he gave his life to protect, were recovered and evacuated. S/Sgt. Stewart's indomitable courage, in the face of overwhelming odds, stands as a tribute to himself and an inspiration to all men of his unit. His actions were in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and the Armed Forces of his country.\n\nParagraph 20: In March 1927, Australian polar explorer George Hubert Wilkins and Eielson explored the drift ice north of Alaska.

Shevelev. His grandfather was the Polish settler Micha\u0142 Jankowski. At an early age he began to hunt with his parents and earned a reputation for sharpshooting. He was nicknamed \"nenuni sonja\" by the local Koreans as his grand father had been called \"nenuni\" or four-eyed for his legendary skills and supposed sixth-sense while out hunting. In 1922, the family moved to northern Korea where they established Novina and Lukomorye resorts near Chongjin. When the Japanese occupied Korea, the family supplied meat to the Japanese army. Valery went to study at the Harbin Men's Gymnasium followed by studies at the Forestry College in Pyongyang. The Japanese police who knew his sharpshooting and hunting skills once showed him a photograph of a rebel hiding in the local forests and offered him a bounty of 10000 yen for his head. Valery declined due to sympathies with the locals and many years later learned that this target had been Kim Il-sung. In 1944, he moved to Manchuria and from 1945 he worked in the Soviet Army serving as a translator with knowledge of Japanese, Korean, and Russian. In 1946 he was arrested because of the family history, both as a White Russian and \"for assisting the international bourgeoisie\", since his family had supported the enemy, the Japanese army. He went to labour camp for six years, which was then extended to 10 years, and an attempt to escape led to a further extension to 25 years. During his sentence at the Gulags, he obtained through the camp management, information on his father and was able to exchange some correspondence. He was released in 1952 after which he worked in a mine in Chukotka and then at Magadan as a forester. He married Vera Maslakova (1912-1980) in Harbin in 1943, but the marriage did not last. In 1944 he married Irma Mayer (1924-1997) and they had a son Sergei. But after his arrest his wife was unable to contact him and she moved to Canada along with her son. He was rehabilitated in 1957 and he married Irina Kazimirovna Piotrovskaya (1924-2010) and moved to lived in Vladimir in 1968 after their son was born. He was in communication with his sisters Musa and Victoria who lived in the United States of America. In 1986, under Gorbachev's relaxation of rules, he was allowed to visit Canada and he met his first wife Irma and his son, then aged forty. The family also had a reunion when a statue of his grandfather was unveiled on September 15, 1991 in the village Bezverkhovo. Attendees included Valery, his son Arseny, sister Victoria, her son and two grandchildren, a grandson of Captain Fridolf Heck, and staff from the Arsenyev Museum. \n\nParagraph 28: Since December 16, 2002, she was one of the news presenters at Noticias Caracol (at the time Caracol Noticias) newscast.

Early in the morning a reinforced North Vietnamese company attacked Company B, which was manning a defensive perimeter in Vietnam. The surprise onslaught wounded 5 members of a 6-man squad caught in the direct path of the enemy's thrust. S/Sgt. Stewart became a lone defender of vital terrain\u2014virtually 1 man against a hostile platoon. Refusing to take advantage of a lull in the firing which would have permitted him to withdraw, S/Sgt. Stewart elected to hold his ground to protect his fallen comrades and prevent an enemy penetration of the company perimeter. As the full force of the platoon-sized man attack struck his lone position, he fought like a man possessed; emptying magazine after magazine at the determined, on-charging enemy. The enemy drove almost to his position and hurled grenades, but S/Sgt. Stewart decimated them by retrieving and throwing the grenades back. Exhausting his ammunition, he crawled under intense fire to his wounded team members and collected ammunition that they were unable to use. Far past the normal point of exhaustion, he held his position for 4 harrowing hours and through 3 assaults, annihilating the enemy as they approached and before they could get a foothold. As a result of his defense, the company position held until the arrival of a reinforcing platoon which counterattacked the enemy, now occupying foxholes to the left of S/Sgt. Stewart's position. After the counterattack, his body was found in a shallow enemy hole where he had advanced in order to add his fire to that of the counterattacking platoon. Eight enemy dead were found around his immediate position, with evidence that 15 others had been dragged away. The wounded whom he gave his life to protect, were recovered and evacuated. S/Sgt. Stewart's indomitable courage, in the face of overwhelming odds, stands as a tribute to himself and an inspiration to all men of his unit. His actions were in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and the Armed Forces of his country.\n\nParagraph 30: Since December 16, 2002, she was one of the news presenters at Noticias Caracol (at the time Caracol Noticias) newscast.

Mexico, Turkey, Estonia are ranked ahead of the U.S. in incidence of homicides. A U.S. male aged 15\u201324 is 70 times more likely to be killed with a gun than their counterpart in the eight (G-8) largest industrialized nations in the world (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy, Russia). In a broader comparison of 218 countries the U.S. is ranked 111. In 2010, the U.S.' homicide rate is 7 times higher than the average for populous developed countries in the OECD, and its firearm-related homicide rate was 25.2 times higher. In 2013, the United States' firearm-related death rate was 10.64 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants, a figure very close to Mexico's 11.17, although in Mexico firearm deaths are predominantly homicides whereas in the United States they are predominantly suicides. (Although Mexico has strict gun laws, the laws restricting carry are often unenforced, and the laws restricting manufacture and sale are often circumvented by trafficking from the United States and other countries.) Canada and Switzerland each have much looser gun control regulation than the majority of developed nations, although significantly more than in the United States, and have firearm death rates of 2.22 and 2.91 per 100,000 citizens, respectively. By comparison Australia, which imposed sweeping gun control laws in response to the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, has a firearm death rate of 0.86 per 100,000, and in the United Kingdom the rate is 0.26. In the year of 2014, there were a total of 8,124 gun homicides in the U.S. In 2015, there were 33,636 deaths due to firearms in the U.S, with homicides accounting for 13,286 of those, while guns were used to kill about 50 people in the U.K., a country with population one fifth of the size of the U.S. population. More people are typically killed with guns in the U.S. in a day (about 85) than in the U.K. in a year, if suicides are included. With deaths by firearm reaching almost 40,000 in the U.S. in 2017, their highest level since 1968, almost 109 people died per day. A study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2018, states that the worldwide gun death reach 250,000 Yearly and the United States is among only six countries that make up half of those fatalities.\n\nParagraph 2: Cromwell also served as the head coach of the USC Trojans football program from 1909 to 1910, and from 1916 to 1918. His involvement with USC football goes back even farther; he is known to have officiated USC games as early as 1903, and he played (along with the coaches of both teams) for USC opponent Harvard School in a 1905 game due to the weakness of the Harvard roster. In his first term as coach, 1909 to 1910, he posted a record of 10\u20131\u20133, but this was exclusively against southern California competition, with no major colleges on the schedule. Like many schools, USC switched from football to rugby, from 1911 to 1913. Cromwell returned as football coach in 1916, by which time USC's teams had begun to be known as the Trojans. By this point, the university was facing competition which more regularly included major colleges such as California, Utah and Stanford, and his relative lack of expertise in the sport was more readily apparent. World War I also depleted the team's ranks in 1917 and 1918. In his final three years his record was still respectable at 11\u20137\u20133, though only 4\u20134\u20131 against major colleges. In his final season in 1918, USC was 2\u20132\u20132.  They did not play a home game in Los Angeles until December 14 due to a citywide ban on public gatherings during the Spanish flu epidemic.  Cromwell was replaced as head football coach following the season by Gus Henderson. During his tenure, Cromwell compiled a 21\u20138\u20136 record. Apart from Sam Barry, who took over the 1941 team in the wake of Howard Jones' death, Cromwell was the last USC football coach for whom it was not his primary sport. He also coached the USC basketball team in 1918, though they only played two games against the Los Angeles Athletic Club, losing both.\n\nParagraph 3: A United Nations peacekeeping force \u2013 UNAMIR \u2013 had been stationed in Rwanda since October 1993, but once the mass slaughter began, the UN and the Belgian Government elected to withdraw troops rather than reinforce the contingent and deploy a larger force. The piecemeal peacekeeping force on the ground was both unable and unauthorised to make any real attempt at stopping the violence, and their role was reduced to seeking a political agreement between the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Interim Hutu Power government, as well as protecting selected havens for Tutsi who were seeking refuge, such as Amahoro Stadium and the H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines. The inaction of the UN in the face of genocide is widely considered one of the UN\u2019s most shameful moments.\n\nParagraph 4: Her mental state, and documentation related to it, is the subject of a 2003 study (Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the Wake) by Carol Loeb Shloss, who believes Lucia Joyce to have been her father's muse for Finnegans Wake. Making heavy reference to the letters between Joyce and her father, the study became the subject of a copyright misuse suit by the James Joyce estate. On 25 March 2007, this litigation was resolved in Shloss's favour. Professor John McCourt, of the University of Macerata, a prize-winning Joyce scholar, trustee of the International James Joyce Foundation, and co-founder and director of the International James Joyce symposium held at Trieste, wrote in A Companion to Literary Biography (ed. Robert Bradford, Wiley Blackwell, 2019) that Shloss, in her \"sometimes obsessive\" book, \"seeks very deliberately to depose Nora (Joyce's wife) as Joyce's chief muse... in doing so, it overplays its hand with exaggerated claims about Lucia's genius and about her importance to Joyce's creative process and vindictively harsh judgments on most members of the Joyce family and circle\"; the book's \"most damaging legacy is the cottage industry of derivative versions of Lucia that it has helped to spawn... the key source for a whole series of writings about Lucia that uncomfortably mix fact and fiction\" including The Joyce Girl (2016) by Annabel Abbs, of which McCourt wrote \"With Abbs, the perverse cycle of interest in Lucia comes full circle. We are back in the territory of fiction fraudulently posing as biography\"; he considered the book \"a prime contender for the worst Joyce-inspired 'biography' ever\". The book was also the subject of criticism in the Irish Times and Irish Examiner regarding the author's \"unsubstantiated speculations\" regarding incest between Lucia and her brother, and the sources of her mental illness. \n\nParagraph 5: Earlier the Jaunpur district was ruled by the Bhar, historically known as Sultan, having its historical dates from 1359, when the city was founded by the Sultan of Delhi Feroz Shah Tughlaq and named in memory of his cousin, Muhammad bin Tughluq, whose given name was Jauna Khan. In 1388, Feroz Shah Tughlaq appointed Malik Sarwar, a eunuch, who is notorious for having been the lover of Feroz Shah Tughlaq's daughter, as the governor of the region. The Sultanate was in disarray because of factional fighting for power, and in 1393 Malik Sarwar declared independence. He and his adopted son Mubarak Shah founded what came to be known as the Sharqi dynasty (dynasty of the East). During the Sharqi period the Jaunpur Sultanate was a strong military power in Northern India, and on several occasions threatened the Delhi Sultanate. The Jaunpur Sultanate attained its greatest height under the younger brother of Mubarak Shah, who ruled as Shams-ud-din Ibrahim Shah (ruled 1402\u20131440). To the east, his kingdom extended to Bihar, and to the west, to Kanauj; he even marched on Delhi at one point. Under the aegis of a Muslim holy man named Qutb al-Alam, he threatened the Sultanate of Bengal under Shihabuddin Bayazid Shah.\n\nParagraph 6: The U.S. is ranked 4th out of 34 developed nations for the highest incidence rate of homicides committed with a firearm, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data.

Thus according to Richard Cameron Wilson, some advocates of AIDS denial are indulging in \"bogus scepticism\" when they argue in this way. Wilson argues that the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it \"centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position\".\n\nParagraph 11: The U.S. is ranked 4th out of 34 developed nations for the highest incidence rate of homicides committed with a firearm, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data.

The Jaunpur Sultanate attained its greatest height under the younger brother of Mubarak Shah, who ruled as Shams-ud-din Ibrahim Shah (ruled 1402\u20131440). To the east, his kingdom extended to Bihar, and to the west, to Kanauj; he even marched on Delhi at one point. Under the aegis of a Muslim holy man named Qutb al-Alam, he threatened the Sultanate of Bengal under Shihabuddin Bayazid Shah.\n\nParagraph 13: Cromwell also served as the head coach of the USC Trojans football program from 1909 to 1910, and from 1916 to 1918. His involvement with USC football goes back even farther; he is known to have officiated USC games as early as 1903, and he played (along with the coaches of both teams) for USC opponent Harvard School in a 1905 game due to the weakness of the Harvard roster. In his first term as coach, 1909 to 1910, he posted a record of 10\u20131\u20133, but this was exclusively against southern California competition, with no major colleges on the schedule. Like many schools, USC switched from football to rugby, from 1911 to 1913. Cromwell returned as football coach in 1916, by which time USC's teams had begun to be known as the Trojans. By this point, the university was facing competition which more regularly included major colleges such as California, Utah and Stanford, and his relative lack of expertise in the sport was more readily apparent. World War I also depleted the team's ranks in 1917 and 1918. In his final three years his record was still respectable at 11\u20137\u20133, though only 4\u20134\u20131 against major colleges. In his final season in 1918, USC was 2\u20132\u20132.  They did not play a home game in Los Angeles until December 14 due to a citywide ban on public gatherings during the Spanish flu epidemic.  Cromwell was replaced as head football coach following the season by Gus Henderson. During his tenure, Cromwell compiled a 21\u20138\u20136 record. Apart from Sam Barry, who took over the 1941 team in the wake of Howard Jones' death, Cromwell was the last USC football coach for whom it was not his primary sport. He also coached the USC basketball team in 1918, though they only played two games against the Los Angeles Athletic Club, losing both.\n\nParagraph 14: A United Nations peacekeeping force \u2013 UNAMIR \u2013 had been stationed in Rwanda since October 1993, but once the mass slaughter began, the UN and the Belgian Government elected to withdraw troops rather than reinforce the contingent and deploy a larger force. The piecemeal peacekeeping force on the ground was both unable and unauthorised to make any real attempt at stopping the violence, and their role was reduced to seeking a political agreement between the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Interim Hutu Power government, as well as protecting selected havens for Tutsi who were seeking refuge, such as Amahoro Stadium and the H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines. The inaction of the UN in the face of genocide is widely considered one of the UN\u2019s most shameful moments.\n\nParagraph 15: While Truzzi's characterization was aimed at the holders of majority views whom he considered were excessively impatient of minority opinions, the term has been used to describe advocates of minority intellectual positions who engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as \"skeptics\" despite cherry picking evidence that conforms to a preexisting belief. Thus according to Richard Cameron Wilson, some advocates of AIDS denial are indulging in \"bogus scepticism\" when they argue in this way. Wilson argues that the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it \"centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position\".\n\nParagraph 16: Her mental state, and documentation related to it, is the subject of a 2003 study (Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the Wake) by Carol Loeb Shloss, who believes Lucia Joyce to have been her father's muse for Finnegans Wake. Making heavy reference to the letters between Joyce and her father, the study became the subject of a copyright misuse suit by the James Joyce estate. On 25 March 2007, this litigation was resolved in Shloss's favour. Professor John McCourt, of the University of Macerata, a prize-winning Joyce scholar, trustee of the International James Joyce Foundation, and co-founder and director of the International James Joyce symposium held at Trieste, wrote in A Companion to Literary Biography (ed. Robert Bradford, Wiley Blackwell, 2019) that Shloss, in her \"sometimes obsessive\" book, \"seeks very deliberately to depose Nora (Joyce's wife) as Joyce's chief muse... in doing so, it overplays its hand with exaggerated claims about Lucia's genius and about her importance to Joyce's creative process and vindictively harsh judgments on most members of the Joyce family and circle\"; the book's \"most damaging legacy is the cottage industry of derivative versions of Lucia that it has helped to spawn... the key source for a whole series of writings about Lucia that uncomfortably mix fact and fiction\" including The Joyce Girl (2016) by Annabel Abbs, of which McCourt wrote \"With Abbs, the perverse cycle of interest in Lucia comes full circle. We are back in the territory of fiction fraudulently posing as biography\"; he considered the book \"a prime contender for the worst Joyce-inspired 'biography' ever\". The book was also the subject of criticism in the Irish Times and Irish Examiner regarding the author's \"unsubstantiated speculations\" regarding incest between Lucia and her brother, and the sources of her mental illness. \n\nParagraph 17: The U.S. is ranked 4th out of 34 developed nations for the highest incidence rate of homicides committed with a firearm, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data. Mexico, Turkey, Estonia are ranked ahead of the U.S. in incidence of homicides. A U.S. male aged 15\u201324 is 70 times more likely to be killed with a gun than their counterpart in the eight (G-8) largest industrialized nations in the world (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy, Russia). In a broader comparison of 218 countries the U.S. is ranked 111. In 2010, the U.S.' homicide rate is 7 times higher than the average for populous developed countries in the OECD, and its firearm-related homicide rate was 25.2 times higher. In 2013, the United States' firearm-related death rate was 10.64 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants, a figure very close to Mexico's 11.17, although in Mexico firearm deaths are predominantly homicides whereas in the United States they are predominantly suicides. (Although Mexico has strict gun laws, the laws restricting carry are often unenforced, and the laws restricting manufacture and sale are often circumvented by trafficking from the United States and other countries.) Canada and Switzerland each have much looser gun control regulation than the majority of developed nations, although significantly more than in the United States, and have firearm death rates of 2.22 and 2.91 per 100,000 citizens, respectively. By comparison Australia, which imposed sweeping gun control laws in response to the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, has a firearm death rate of 0.86 per 100,000, and in the United Kingdom the rate is 0.26. In the year of 2014, there were a total of 8,124 gun homicides in the U.S. In 2015, there were 33,636 deaths due to firearms in the U.S, with homicides accounting for 13,286 of those, while guns were used to kill about 50 people in the U.K., a country with population one fifth of the size of the U.S. population. More people are typically killed with guns in the U.S. in a day (about 85) than in the U.K. in a year, if suicides are included. With deaths by firearm reaching almost 40,000 in the U.S. in 2017, their highest level since 1968, almost 109 people died per day. A study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2018, states that the worldwide gun death reach 250,000 Yearly and the United States is among only six countries that make up half of those fatalities.\n\nParagraph 18: Filming started in August 1974. Resisting the urge to shoot another film in black and white, Bogdanovich had it art-directed as \"Black and White in Color\". He wanted the characters to feel like they were having a conversation using \"greeting cards in the form of songs\" like \"they didn't know what to say to each other.\" The movies of Ernst Lubitsch with Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier such as One Hour With You, The Love Parade, The Merry Widow and The Smiling Lieutenant influenced Bogdanovich to have all of the song sequences be filmed live, as it would recreate the \"kind of sad, funny, melancholy, silly,\" and \"spontaneous\" vibe of the films. However, all of the lead actors, especially Reynolds \"weren't accomplished singers or dancers,\" resulting in a lot of delays and mess-ups during the shooting process. In addition, the cast had a tough time performing the sequences due to having to perform them in one take and deal with wonky receiver systems in order to listen to the instrumentals. Bogdanovich later said he \"was very arrogant\" during the making of the film, \"but that arrogance was bought out of a frantic insecurity. I knew it was so possible I was wrong that I became tough about insisting that I was right.\"\n\nPlease enter the final count of unique paragraphs after removing duplicates.

In 1388, Feroz Shah Tughlaq appointed Malik Sarwar, a eunuch, who is notorious for having been the lover of Feroz Shah Tughlaq's daughter, as the governor of the region.

In his first term as coach, 1909 to 1910, he posted a record of 10\u20131\u20133, but this was exclusively against southern California competition, with no major colleges on the schedule. Like many schools, USC switched from football to rugby, from 1911 to 1913. Cromwell returned as football coach in 1916, by which time USC's teams had begun to be known as the Trojans. By this point, the university was facing competition which more regularly included major colleges such as California, Utah and Stanford, and his relative lack of expertise in the sport was more readily apparent. World War I also depleted the team's ranks in 1917 and 1918. In his final three years his record was still respectable at 11\u20137\u20133, though only 4\u20134\u20131 against major colleges. In his final season in 1918, USC was 2\u20132\u20132.  They did not play a home game in Los Angeles until December 14 due to a citywide ban on public gatherings during the Spanish flu epidemic.  Cromwell was replaced as head football coach following the season by Gus Henderson. During his tenure, Cromwell compiled a 21\u20138\u20136 record. Apart from Sam Barry, who took over the 1941 team in the wake of Howard Jones' death, Cromwell was the last USC football coach for whom it was not his primary sport. He also coached the USC basketball team in 1918, though they only played two games against the Los Angeles Athletic Club, losing both.\n\nParagraph 14: A United Nations peacekeeping force \u2013 UNAMIR \u2013 had been stationed in Rwanda since October 1993, but once the mass slaughter began, the UN and the Belgian Government elected to withdraw troops rather than reinforce the contingent and deploy a larger force. The piecemeal peacekeeping force on the ground was both unable and unauthorised to make any real attempt at stopping the violence, and their role was reduced to seeking a political agreement between the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Interim Hutu Power government, as well as protecting selected havens for Tutsi who were seeking refuge, such as Amahoro Stadium and the H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines. The inaction of the UN in the face of genocide is widely considered one of the UN\u2019s most shameful moments.\n\nParagraph 15: While Truzzi's characterization was aimed at the holders of majority views whom he considered were excessively impatient of minority opinions, the term has been used to describe advocates of minority intellectual positions who engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as \"skeptics\" despite cherry picking evidence that conforms to a preexisting belief. Thus according to Richard Cameron Wilson, some advocates of AIDS denial are indulging in \"bogus scepticism\" when they argue in this way. Wilson argues that the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it \"centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position\".\n\nParagraph 16: Her mental state, and documentation related to it, is the subject of a 2003 study (Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the Wake) by Carol Loeb Shloss, who believes Lucia Joyce to have been her father's muse for Finnegans Wake. Making heavy reference to the letters between Joyce and her father, the study became the subject of a copyright misuse suit by the James Joyce estate. On 25 March 2007, this litigation was resolved in Shloss's favour. Professor John McCourt, of the University of Macerata, a prize-winning Joyce scholar, trustee of the International James Joyce Foundation, and co-founder and director of the International James Joyce symposium held at Trieste, wrote in A Companion to Literary Biography (ed. Robert Bradford, Wiley Blackwell, 2019) that Shloss, in her \"sometimes obsessive\" book, \"seeks very deliberately to depose Nora (Joyce's wife) as Joyce's chief muse... in doing so, it overplays its hand with exaggerated claims about Lucia's genius and about her importance to Joyce's creative process and vindictively harsh judgments on most members of the Joyce family and circle\"; the book's \"most damaging legacy is the cottage industry of derivative versions of Lucia that it has helped to spawn... the key source for a whole series of writings about Lucia that uncomfortably mix fact and fiction\" including The Joyce Girl (2016) by Annabel Abbs, of which McCourt wrote \"With Abbs, the perverse cycle of interest in Lucia comes full circle. We are back in the territory of fiction fraudulently posing as biography\"; he considered the book \"a prime contender for the worst Joyce-inspired 'biography' ever\". The book was also the subject of criticism in the Irish Times and Irish Examiner regarding the author's \"unsubstantiated speculations\" regarding incest between Lucia and her brother, and the sources of her mental illness. \n\nParagraph 17: The U.S. is ranked 4th out of 34 developed nations for the highest incidence rate of homicides committed with a firearm, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data. Mexico, Turkey, Estonia are ranked ahead of the U.S. in incidence of homicides. A U.S. male aged 15\u201324 is 70 times more likely to be killed with a gun than their counterpart in the eight (G-8) largest industrialized nations in the world (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy, Russia). In a broader comparison of 218 countries the U.S. is ranked 111. In 2010, the U.S.' homicide rate is 7 times higher than the average for populous developed countries in the OECD, and its firearm-related homicide rate was 25.2 times higher. In 2013, the United States' firearm-related death rate was 10.64 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants, a figure very close to Mexico's 11.17, although in Mexico firearm deaths are predominantly homicides whereas in the United States they are predominantly suicides. (Although Mexico has strict gun laws, the laws restricting carry are often unenforced, and the laws restricting manufacture and sale are often circumvented by trafficking from the United States and other countries.) Canada and Switzerland each have much looser gun control regulation than the majority of developed nations, although significantly more than in the United States, and have firearm death rates of 2.22 and 2.91 per 100,000 citizens, respectively. By comparison Australia, which imposed sweeping gun control laws in response to the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, has a firearm death rate of 0.86 per 100,000, and in the United Kingdom the rate is 0.26. In the year of 2014, there were a total of 8,124 gun homicides in the U.S. In 2015, there were 33,636 deaths due to firearms in the U.S, with homicides accounting for 13,286 of those, while guns were used to kill about 50 people in the U.K., a country with population one fifth of the size of the U.S. population. More people are typically killed with guns in the U.S. in a day (about 85) than in the U.K. in a year, if suicides are included. With deaths by firearm reaching almost 40,000 in the U.S. in 2017, their highest level since 1968, almost 109 people died per day. A study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2018, states that the worldwide gun death reach 250,000 Yearly and the United States is among only six countries that make up half of those fatalities.\n\nParagraph 18: Filming started in August 1974. Resisting the urge to shoot another film in black and white, Bogdanovich had it art-directed as \"Black and White in Color\". He wanted the characters to feel like they were having a conversation using \"greeting cards in the form of songs\" like \"they didn't know what to say to each other.\" The movies of Ernst Lubitsch with Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier such as One Hour With You, The Love Parade, The Merry Widow and The Smiling Lieutenant influenced Bogdanovich to have all of the song sequences be filmed live, as it would recreate the \"kind of sad, funny, melancholy, silly,\" and \"spontaneous\" vibe of the films. However, all of the lead actors, especially Reynolds \"weren't accomplished singers or dancers,\" resulting in a lot of delays and mess-ups during the shooting process. In addition, the cast had a tough time performing the sequences due to having to perform them in one take and deal with wonky receiver systems in order to listen to the instrumentals. Bogdanovich later said he \"was very arrogant\" during the making of the film, \"but that arrogance was bought out of a frantic insecurity. I knew it was so possible I was wrong that I became tough about insisting that I was right.\"", "answers": ["7"], "pred": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,", "length": 4974, "dataset": "passage_count", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c4af14def5df38d2eedc972316d077547529ed5885636d3f"}

He maintains records of people he believes to be \"evil\" and has convinced himself that the so called \"evil\" people (communists, subversives, thieves, murderers) are engaged in a world wide conspiracy and have taken over Washington. He makes phone calls to them and their employers at all hours, writes letters regarding their actions, demands their prompt firing, and threatens to involve higher authorities if they do not comply. Unsatisfied with the results of his anonymous calls and letters, he searches for a more effective way to eliminate evil from the world; he settles on the idea of shrinking all evil people to two feet tall. Throughout the episode, Crangle's parrot Pete periodically calls out \"nut,\" asking for a nut to eat, which Crangle gives him, not realizing that Pete is unintentionally calling Crangle a \"nut.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Eventually, the agents find footage of Division agent Aaron Keener going rogue and killing other agents, having gone insane after witnessing the chaos and destruction caused during the breakdown of order following the initial outbreak. It is also discovered Keener and the rest of the first wave of agents who went rogue along with him are assisting the \"Last Man Battalion\" (LMB), an equally rogue private military company that was abandoned by the government during the evacuation, and are now hostile to it. Working together, these two groups destroyed the VTOL and killed the Commander to weaken Division operations in New York. Intercepting a signal from the Russian consulate, the agents attempt to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a Russian virologist who claims to have information on the Green Poison. However, he is kidnapped by Keener and the LMB before the Division can reach him. After helping the JTF secure supplies and weapons, the JTF and Division agents launch an attack on the LMB's base, the now-evacuated United Nations headquarters. The agent finds footage of Keener and his fellow rogue agents abandoning the LMB, with Tchernenko as their prisoner. The leader of the LMB, Charles Bliss, initially escapes in a helicopter, but then returns to make a final stand alongside his men. In the end, the agent destroys the vehicle, killing Bliss. Lau informs the agent that most threats are destroyed or weakened, however the LMB was split into factions. New York is approaching stability, but an unknown signal leads the agent to a secluded laboratory. There, they find Dr. Amherst's remains, having discovered that he has died from exposure to his own virus. They also find a message from Keener, showing he has the technology to manufacture a new strain of Green Poison and intends to do so, and mysteriously tells the agent to explore the center of Manhattan, called the \u201cDark Zone.\u201d The agent is informed that the information in the lab will further the development of a vaccine and is shown a recovered message from Amherst. In the message, Amherst reveals he engineered Green Poison as part of his eco-terrorist plan to decimate the human race and preserve the planet. If the player follows Keener's instructions, they will discover a message from Keener claiming that he plans to continue with Amherst's plot, as he has come to worship the virus as the judge of all humanity and plans to reverse engineer and improve it; he then offers the player a position beside him based on their actions in the Dark Zone.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1987, Wright moved to the Nomads senior team, the San Diego Nomads which played in the Western Soccer Alliance. The Nomads won the league championship that season and again in 1988. In 1990, the WSA merged with the east-coast based American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). The Nomads spend one season in the APSL before leaving the league. In 1989, the Cleveland Crunch of the Major Indoor Soccer League drafted Wright with the sixth pick of the expansion draft.  On March 6, 1990, the Crunch traded Wright to the San Diego Sockers. The Sockers, perennial contenders, won the MISL championship that season with Wright named as the Championship Series Unsung Hero. Wright remained in San Diego until the MISL collapsed in 1992. On January 7, 1993, Wright signed with the Milwaukee Wave of the National Professional Soccer League (NSPL). Although the Wave failed to make the playoffs, Wright's forty-five goals in twenty-five games led to his selection as a first team All Star. That summer Wright signed with the Los Angeles Salsa of the outdoor American Professional Soccer League. In October, 1993, the Salsa loaned Wright to the Baltimore Blast of the NPSL. Wright was back the Salsa for the summer 1994 season, but after the Salsa folded that fall, he signed with the Wichita Wings of the NPSL for the 1994\u20131995 season. Wright would not return to the NPSL until 1999. In 1993, Wright signed with the Los Angeles Salsa of the outdoor American Professional Soccer League. He had not played outdoor soccer since playing with the Nomads in 1990, but this did not stop Wright from finishing second in points and goals to team mate Paulinho Crici\u00fama, being named a first team All Star.  In 1994, Wright led the league in scoring, tying Paulhino for the points lead. He was again selected as a first team All Star.  After playing with the Baltimore Blast during the 1994\u20131995 winter indoor season, Wright did not return to the APSL, but instead signed with the Sacramento Knights of the Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL). The CISL played a summer indoor schedule. In December 1995, Major League Soccer announced it had signed Wright to a league contract. In preparation for its first season, MLS signed players to contracts, then distributed these players through the league via an initial allocation and an inaugural player draft. In February 1996, the Kansas City Wizards selected Wright in the third round (twenty-fifth overall) of the 1996 MLS Supplemental Draft. He spent four seasons in Kansas City. When the Wizards released him in 1999, Wright signed with the Western Mass Pioneers where he played four outdoor seasons. In the fall of 1999, he returned to the Baltimore Blast in the NPSL. He spent most of three seasons in Baltimore, but saw time in seven games with the Philadelphia KiXX during the 2000\u20132001 season. In February 2002, the Blast waived Wright, who was leading the team in scoring at the time. The San Diego Sockers quickly signed Wright in preparation for the team's move to the new Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). In October 2002, he signed another year-long contract and remained with the Sockers until it discontinued operations in December 2005. On January 5, 2005, the Chicago Storm selected Wright in the MISL Dispersal Draft. Wright both owns an athletic training company, Speed to Burn. In April 2006, he joined the San Diego Fusion of the amateur fourth division National Premier Soccer League. In 2009, he signed with the San Diego Sockers of the Professional Arena Soccer League. In May 2011, it was announced he signed with a new team in the PASL, the Anaheim Bolts. In October 2012, he re-signed with the San Diego Sockers for the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1965, M\u00e9zi\u00e8res arranged a working visa through a friend of Jij\u00e9's who had a factory in Houston, Texas. In the end, however, he never took up the job in Houston. After staying in New York for a few months, the call of the West proved too strong and eventually he ended up hitchhiking across the country, first to Seattle and then to Montana (where he worked on a ranch driving tractors, laying posts and cleaning stables) before ending up in San Francisco. His initial plan was to find work in an advertising agency in San Francisco but he ran foul of the Immigration Service who told him that his visa was good for working in the factory in Houston and nowhere else. He quickly left San Francisco in search of an authentic \"Wild West\" cowboy experience. Arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah with no money, he sought out Pierre Christin, who was living there while teaching at the University of Utah, and turned up on his doorstep asking him if he could sleep on his settee. To make ends meet, M\u00e9zi\u00e8res produced some illustrations for a small advertising agency in Salt Lake City and for a Mormon children's magazine called Children's Friend as well as selling some photographs he had taken while working on the ranch in Montana. After a few months, he found work on a ranch in Utah: this time succeeding in his aspiration of living the life of a cowboy, an experience he described as \"better than in my dreams\".\n\nParagraph 5: This symbology, derived from the RM4SCC system used by the British Royal Mail, uses a series of bars, each of which can individually have one of four possible states, to encode information used in automated sortation and delivery onto each piece of mail.  Each bar can either be short and centred (known as a tracker), medium and elevated (an ascender), medium and lowered (a descender), or full height.  This symbology also uses an element known as a Data Content Identifier (or DCI), which specifies what types of information are encoded into each barcode, such as postal codes, customer information, and exact delivery points.  The information that goes into each barcode is obtained from the address printed on the front of the envelope it is ultimately printed on, as well as the physical dimensions of each piece of mail.  This code also uses a Reed-Solomon error correction technique, so that in case a particular piece of mail is mishandled, the information encoded in the barcode can still be correctly decoded.\n\nParagraph 6: During his medical and teaching career, Bowen also got into Republican Party politics, serving as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1960 to 1972. He was speaker of the house from 1967 to 1972, vice chairman of the legislative council from 1967 to 1968, and chairman until 1972. After his first unsuccessful attempt in the Republican primary in 1968, he was elected Governor of Indiana in 1972 and was re-elected for a second term in 1976, making him the first Governor to serve for eight consecutive years in Indiana since 1851. His campaign slogan, featured in huge letters on billboards, was \"Otis Bowen. He Hears You\".  His tenure in Indiana's highest public office was marked by a major tax restructuring reducing reliance on property taxes, major improvements to state park facilities, development of a statewide emergency medical services system, and adoption of a medical malpractice law that was destined to become a national model. From 1978 to 1985, he also served on the board of trustees for Valparaiso University. Simultaneously, Bowen served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, the Midwestern Governors Association, and the National Governors Association. In 1980, he served as President of the Council of State Governments.\n\nParagraph 7:  The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old \"standing buffalo\" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue \"charging buffalo\" logo. Later that season, the Cowboys used the \"double-star\" uniform, which could be considered an updated version of the 1960s jerseys. Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red \"standing buffalo\" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the AFL-era jerseys as opposed to the Jim Kelly/Marv Levy-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The New York Jets also received similar criticism for using their throwback logo on their then-current green helmets; when they adopted the throwback design full-time in 1998, they also went back to their original-style white helmets. The Bills and Cowboys did the same when they adopted their retro unis.\n\nParagraph 8: Maas was the Chiefs first-round draft pick in 1984, the fifth player taken overall.  He lived up to his first-round status, being named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year despite missing two games. After a career-high seven sacks in 1985, he matched that total the next season and was awarded his first Pro Bowl nod. He went back again to the Pro Bowl in the strike-shortened 1987 season after getting six sacks and scoring a touchdown off of a fumble recovery. Maas got off to a fast start in 1988, getting four sacks and a safety in his first seven games. He then got hurt in the eighth game and missed the rest of the season. The 1989 season was the first year in his career he did not have a sack, as it was shortened to 10 games because of injury. He did score the last touchdown of his career off of a fumble. Kansas City moved him to defensive end in 1990. He had 5.5 sacks and a safety that season. After an injury-filled 1992 season, he joined the Green Bay Packers. He spent most of the year backing up John Jurkovic at nose tackle.\n\nParagraph 9: This symbology, derived from the RM4SCC system used by the British Royal Mail, uses a series of bars, each of which can individually have one of four possible states, to encode information used in automated sortation and delivery onto each piece of mail.  Each bar can either be short and centred (known as a tracker), medium and elevated (an ascender), medium and lowered (a descender), or full height.  This symbology also uses an element known as a Data Content Identifier (or DCI), which specifies what types of information are encoded into each barcode, such as postal codes, customer information, and exact delivery points.

His telegraphed acceptance to race failed to arrive in time (delivery was delayed due to a public holiday in Melbourne), and Archer was refused permission to enter the race. Nominations for the 1863 Melbourne Cup had to be lodged with the Victorian Turf Club by Wednesday, 29 April, accompanied by five gold sovereigns. De Mestre had nominated two of his horses, Archer and Haidee. Weights were declared and published in Bell's Life in Sydney on Saturday, 9 May. Archer was to carry 11\u00a0st 4\u00a0lb (71.82\u00a0kg, or 158\u00a0lb) - which, if he had raced, would have been the heaviest handicap in the history of the Melbourne Cup. Under the care of groom and trainer Tom Lamond Archer and Haidee steamed to Melbourne, leaving Sydney on the City Of Melbourne Tuesday, 16 June. Acceptance, with an additional five-sovereign payment, had to be lodged with the VTC by 8pm Wednesday, 1 July; de Mestre (still in Sydney) had overlooked the deadline. Reminded on the morning of 1 July  by Sam Jenner of George Kirk & Co. of the deadline, de Mestre requested a telegram be sent to the Melbourne office of George Kirk & Co. asking them to accept on his behalf. De Mestre took the telegram to the telegraph office himself, and it was received in the Melbourne Telegraph Office at 1 pm. Wednesday, 1 July was a public holiday in Melbourne, and the telegram was not delivered to the George Kirk & Co. offices until 7:30 pm. The next morning George Kirk handed the telegram to the stewards at the Turf Club, who decided it was too late. This decision caused controversy amongst Archer's Sydney supporters, who had expected him to win. Pressure by Victorian owners made no difference to the VTC, which stood its ground. To protest this decision and show solidarity, the interstate entrants boycotted the third Cup. Unknown at the time, however, was that due to injury Archer would have been unlikely to race. The third Melbourne Cup ran with only seven Victoria horses, the smallest number in its history.\n\nParagraph 11: Prosanto Mullick is a well-known and successful businessman. He is so much in love with Debi, his wife that he readily walks out of a business meeting where the deal amounts to around Rs.7 crore when a telephone call from home informs that she is ill. She is all decked up and ready to wish him happy wedding anniversary, piano, song and all. The tell-tale white streaks in her hair show that they have been married for a while. She faints as the song ends and you\u2019ve guessed it \u2013 she is pregnant. But hubby dear is not happy. When she delivers twins, he hates to share her with them. Enter villain Charandas, an old friend of Prosanto who had the twitters for Debi but is out to avenge the stinging slap she gave him before he went to jail. He wants to set up a business. Prosanto writes out a cheque for Rs.3 crore. But Charandas\u2019 intentions are different. He kidnaps the older of the twins but to avoid being caught by the neighbourhood public, dumps the baby into the community dustbin and makes good his escape. Rahmat, the neighbourhood thief, picks up the infant, takes him home and brings him up, without keeping the story of how he found him a secret. Debi suspects that her husband of the kidnap because she finds his wrist-watch on the floor. During a heated argument, she falls off the stairs, loses her sanity and is placed in a mental home. Prosanto is jailed for 14 years and in the meanwhile, the kidnapped twin who has named himself Arjun, grows up to become the modern Robin Hood of the locality, fighting the bad ones for justice. Nandini, Charandas\u2019 beautiful daughter, falls in love with him at first sight when he steps into her marriage mandap and rescues her from marriage to a politician\u2019s villainous son. Though he does his quota of singing and dancing, he longs for the mother he thinks threw him away and feels a strange pull towards the crazy Debi when Prosanto, out of jail, asks him to help him fight Charandas for revenge. Around this time, the second twin, Akash, flies back home with a degree in psychiatric medicine under his arm. He wants to cure his mother and also falls in love with a fellow-passenger on his way back home. Some more singing and dancing follows while Arjun becomes a trusted aide of Prosanto, each one unaware of the father-son tie they are bound by. With a great deal of action scenes filled with fights, fisticuffs, breaking of ropes and so on, Charandas is defeated in his devious plans of decimating the family he hates, Debi is cured completely, Arjun and Nandini are united, blood ties are reinforced, and you just wait to hear the still photographer say \u2018smile\u2019 for the last group photograph.\n\nParagraph 12: In Bengal, Varthma met a pair of Chinese Christian merchants. This passage has provoked various conjectures by historians since. According to Varthema, the pair were from the \"city of Sarnau\", and that there were \"many other Christian lords\" like them there, all of them \"subjects of the Great Khan of Cathay\". The location of Sarnau is unclear. The name does not show up on contemporary maps, but appears in a few other travelogues of the time. Some (e.g. Fra Oderico) claim Sarnau is in northern China, but others (e.g. Giovanni da Empoli, Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto) suggest it is located in Indochina. The most frequent suggestion is that Sarnau is the Thai capital city of Ayutthaya. The term \"Sarnau\" may just be a transcription of the Persian term \"Shar-i Nau\", meaning \"New City\", the name by which Ayutthaya was also known at the time. There is no contradiction in their statement about Cathay: the Ayutthaya kingdom, like most other kingdoms of Indochina, had been notionally tributary to the Chinese emperor. Their identification as \"Christian\" and \"many other Christian lords\" may seem puzzling as Christianity was not known to have reached Thailand at this time. However, Nestorian Christian communities had spread in Central Asia and China with the Mongol Empire, and the persecutions after the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368 may have prompted an exodus of Nestorian Christian refugees to Indochina. Later in the travelogue, Varthema notes the ruler of Pegu (Burma) had an entire regiment of such Christians. However, Varthema claims they are \"as white as us\" and \"write in a contrary way to us, in the manner of the Armenians\". Setting aside the latter error (Armenian is written from left to right, like Latin script), Varthema may have meant Syriac script, implying these were most likely ethnically Central Asian or Persian Nestorian Christians, who moved to China during the Yuan dynasty, and later found their way to Indochina. However, it does not rule out that they may simply have been Chinese or Thai converts - Varthema uses the term \"white\" repeatedly to describe Southeast Asians (in contrast to South Asians).\n\nParagraph 13: Many were attracted to the Christian and Missionary Alliance, in its origin, because of the ministry of healing, and a striking parallel is noted in the founding of the Altoona Alliance Church in 1891, just four years after the founding of the national movement. A lady from Altoona, Pennsylvania, suffering from cancer, went to Pittsburgh, where she came into contact with two Christian workers of the Christian and Missionary Alliance church in that city, who prayed for her healing. After her healing she was very desirous that a full Gospel work be opened in her city, and in that same year Rev. and Mrs. Frederick H. Senft were invited to Altoona, Pa. Rev. Senft arrived in Altoona, Pa February 1891 and this was the official start of the Christian & Missionary Alliance in Altoona. After much prayer they arranged for a convention that summer in the Fifth Avenue Methodist church, securing as speakers, Dr. and Mrs. A. B. Simpson and several others. Those receiving blessing at these services desired the Alliance work continue, meeting at times to pray to that end. During the latter part of 1891 services were held in the home of the Blackwell family at 1900 10th Street. As a result, on January 23, 1892, Rev. Senft opened a Gospel Mission on 17th Street at Union and 11th Avenues. In July, 1893 the church moved to 1200 6th Avenue where a large front room served as the church meeting location, and two years later in 1894, the attendance demanded larger quarters, the pastor moved to 1428 8th Avenue, where they remained until April, 1896. In this year, Rev. Senft, acceding to the wishes of Dr. A. B. Simpson, moved to Philadelphia where an Alliance church was also established and in which city he spent the major part of his life. Under the leadership of Rev. Senft the congregation grew to more than 100 persons. Altoona, as far as can be learned, was the 2nd Alliance work in Pennsylvania. After Rev. Senft departed in 1896, Rev. B. M. Osgood became the pastor of the Altoona Alliance congregation. The church move buildings to 8th Avenue at 9th Street and continued to meet there until 1898. During this two-year period there were three pastors of the church. During the year of 1898, newly appointed Rev. Bush moved the church to 906 Green Avenue, where they held meetings on the second flood of the building. The church remained at this location until 1900.\n\nParagraph 14: With an original name of Thomastown, it was mainly built by William James Thomas, a co-owner of the Bedwas Navigation Colliery Company, (also of mines in Aberdare in the Cynon Valley). Most of the earlier parts of Trethomas were built in and around 1900 - 1913, when the mine was developing and at the apex of coal production in the South Wales coalfield. The terraced streets of Trethomas were appropriately named, some were named after members of William Thomas's family, hence the names: William, James, Thomas, and Mary. Others involved association with local areas, such as Navigation Street (associated with the Bedwas Navigation Colliery Company), Coronation Street (for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953), Redbrook Avenue after Redbrook House, which once stood on the left of the road entering the village from Machen (opposite the Chequered Flag petrol station), until its demolition in the late 1950s. It was named after the brook that ran nearby and coloured red with rust from the old drift mine that was situated at Glyn Gwyn - now redeveloped as Addison Way leading up to Graig-Y-Rhacca. The bridge over the now demolished railway line on Addison Way was built on the remains of the coal tipping from the mine.\n\nParagraph 15: During his medical and teaching career, Bowen also got into Republican Party politics, serving as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1960 to 1972. He was speaker of the house from 1967 to 1972, vice chairman of the legislative council from 1967 to 1968, and chairman until 1972. After his first unsuccessful attempt in the Republican primary in 1968, he was elected Governor of Indiana in 1972 and was re-elected for a second term in 1976, making him the first Governor to serve for eight consecutive years in Indiana since 1851. His campaign slogan, featured in huge letters on billboards, was \"Otis Bowen. He Hears You\".  His tenure in Indiana's highest public office was marked by a major tax restructuring reducing reliance on property taxes, major improvements to state park facilities, development of a statewide emergency medical services system, and adoption of a medical malpractice law that was destined to become a national model. From 1978 to 1985, he also served on the board of trustees for Valparaiso University. Simultaneously, Bowen served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, the Midwestern Governors Association, and the National Governors Association. In 1980, he served as President of the Council of State Governments.\n\nParagraph 16: A technicality resulted in Archer's being denied a third try at the Melbourne Cup. His telegraphed acceptance to race failed to arrive in time (delivery was delayed due to a public holiday in Melbourne), and Archer was refused permission to enter the race. Nominations for the 1863 Melbourne Cup had to be lodged with the Victorian Turf Club by Wednesday, 29 April, accompanied by five gold sovereigns. De Mestre had nominated two of his horses, Archer and Haidee. Weights were declared and published in Bell's Life in Sydney on Saturday, 9 May. Archer was to carry 11\u00a0st 4\u00a0lb (71.82\u00a0kg, or 158\u00a0lb) - which, if he had raced, would have been the heaviest handicap in the history of the Melbourne Cup. Under the care of groom and trainer Tom Lamond Archer and Haidee steamed to Melbourne, leaving Sydney on the City Of Melbourne Tuesday, 16 June. Acceptance, with an additional five-sovereign payment, had to be lodged with the VTC by 8pm Wednesday, 1 July; de Mestre (still in Sydney) had overlooked the deadline. Reminded on the morning of 1 July  by Sam Jenner of George Kirk & Co. of the deadline, de Mestre requested a telegram be sent to the Melbourne office of George Kirk & Co. asking them to accept on his behalf. De Mestre took the telegram to the telegraph office himself, and it was received in the Melbourne Telegraph Office at 1 pm. Wednesday, 1 July was a public holiday in Melbourne, and the telegram was not delivered to the George Kirk & Co. offices until 7:30 pm. The next morning George Kirk handed the telegram to the stewards at the Turf Club, who decided it was too late. This decision caused controversy amongst Archer's Sydney supporters, who had expected him to win. Pressure by Victorian owners made no difference to the VTC, which stood its ground. To protest this decision and show solidarity, the interstate entrants boycotted the third Cup. Unknown at the time, however, was that due to injury Archer would have been unlikely to race. The third Melbourne Cup ran with only seven Victoria horses, the smallest number in its history.\n\nParagraph 17: Resh Lakish interpreted the words \"Korah . . . took\" in  to teach that Korah took a bad bargain for himself. As the three Hebrew consonants that spell Korah's name also spell the Hebrew word for \"bald\" (kereach), the Gemara deduced that he was called Korah because he caused a bald spot to be formed among the Israelites when the earth swallowed his followers. As the name Izhar () in  derived from the same Hebrew root as the word \"noon\" (, tzohorayim), the Gemara deduced from \"son of Izhar\" that Korah was a son who brought upon himself anger hot as the noon sun. As the name Kohath () in  derived from the same Hebrew root as the word for \"set on edge\" (, kihah), the Gemara deduced from \"son of Kohath\" that Korah was a son who set his ancestors' teeth on edge. The Gemara deduced from the words \"son of Levi\" in  that Korah was a son who was escorted to Gehenna. The Gemara asked why  did not say \"the son of Jacob,\" and Rabbi Samuel bar Isaac answered that Jacob had prayed not to be listed amongst Korah's ancestors in , where it is written, \"Let my soul not come into their council; unto their assembly let my glory not be united.\" \"Let my soul not come into their council\" referred to the spies, and \"unto their assembly let my glory not be united\" referred to Korah's assembly. As the name Dathan () in  derived from the same Hebrew root as the word \"law\" (, dat), the Gemara deduced from Dathan's name that he violated God's law. The Gemara related the name Abiram () in  to the Hebrew word for \"strengthened\" (iber) and deduced from Abiram's name that he stoutly refused to repent. The Gemara related the name On () in  to the Hebrew word for \"mourning\" (, aninah) and deduced from On's name that he sat in lamentations. The Gemara related the name Peleth () in  to the Hebrew word for \"miracles\" (pelaot) and deduced from Peleth's name that God performed wonders for him. And as the name Reuben () derived from the Hebrew words \"see\" (reu) and \"understand\" (, mavin), the Gemara deduced from the reference to On as a \"son of Reuben\" in that On was a son who saw and understood.\n\nParagraph 18: With an original name of Thomastown, it was mainly built by William James Thomas, a co-owner of the Bedwas Navigation Colliery Company, (also of mines in Aberdare in the Cynon Valley). Most of the earlier parts of Trethomas were built in and around 1900 - 1913, when the mine was developing and at the apex of coal production in the South Wales coalfield.

It is of two stories, supported on pillars, and a canopy with arches on each side. The lower courses of richly carved stone are of great age. Above them runs a frieze with an unintelligible pattern, and, above this, running right round the building, a fringe of elephants' heads and forequarters carved in stone. Above this is a very ranch worn frieze full of figures in bass-relief, men on horseback with bows, and animals. The elephant is a very frequent emblem. Besides the fringe frieze above mentioned, there are, on the outer wall, between every two angles, larger figures of semi-rampant elephants standing out in relief, and, in front of the entrance, stands on either side of the doorway a gigantic cement elephant. Above the shrine, a pyramid-based tower rises into a spire like a high-shouldered cone with flattened sides. The forepart of the roof consists of a number of small domes springing from a flat roof, or rather of a flat trabeate roof, with domes here and there, the largest being in the centre. Outside at all the angles of the roof are figures of animals and the gargoyles. On walls, there are some scenes from the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana.\n\nParagraph 20: After several months had passed, Casey contacted MacDonald and expressed his interest in reforming Bury Your Dead. They rounded up some of their old lineup, with a few others to fill in, and played some shows before heading down to Florida to play the annual Gainesville Fest. After acquiring vocalist Mat Bruso, they ran into their old drummer, Mark, who was touring with Between the Buried and Me, and they discussed their desire to make Bury Your Dead a serious band again. Castillo agreed, and the band did a few short tours as well as appearances at hardcore festivals including Hellfest and The New England Metal and Hardcore Festival.\n\nParagraph 21: The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage: The Official Style Guide Used by the Writers and Editors of the World's Most Authoritative Newspaper is a style guide first published in 1950 by editors at the newspaper and revised in 1974, 1999, and 2002 by Allan M. Siegal and William G. Connolly. According to the Times Deputy News Editor Philip B. Corbett (in charge of revising the manual) in 2007, the newspaper maintains an updated, intranet version of the manual that is used by NYT staff, but this online version is not available to the general public. An e-book version of this fifth edition was issued in February 2015,  and it was released in paperback form in September 2015 (Three Rivers Press, ).\n\nParagraph 22: The group eventually wakes up the next morning/afternoon. At first everything appears normal, but it soon becomes clear that Steve and his cohorts are nowhere to be found on the premises. None of the friends remembers much about what happened the previous night. And four of the friends (Jordan, Brandy, Ryan, Anna) wake up realizing they're tied up or otherwise physically incapacitated. Jordan is tied up to a chair in the bathroom next to the bathtub, with a bucket on his arm and an electric wire tied to his hand. Brandy is tied up in the bathtub. Ryan is tied to a chair in his room, and Anna is tied up on the bed, at her hands and her feet. At first the friends believe this to be some sort of bad joke, but when Todd and Claire witness Phil being intentionally decapitated by Brad, it becomes clear that Steve, Brad, Norah and Chloe are actually cruel, sadistic sociopaths, (who call themselves \"the helpers\") intent on torturing and murdering the group. Claire (Kristen Quintrall) and Todd are locked in their motel room and are forced to watch while their friends get murdered one by one. The helpers go into Anna and Ryan's room and reveal that each end of Anna's body is chained to a car, and they will drive the cars and rip her body in half. They do so, while Ryan is tied up and unable to stop them. They then go into Jordan and Brandy's room and explain that the wire attached to Jordan's arm will be lowered into the water in the bathtub by placing rocks in the bucket hanging from his arm, electrocuting Brandy. Brandy is killed from being electrocuted four times, while Jordan's arm with the wire was forcibly placed in the water. The men remove Brandy from the tub and leave Jordan with Norah. Norah taunts Jordan, who then pushes Norah into the tub and electrocutes her with the wire, killing her. Todd and Claire also manage to successfully escape from their room. However, Todd and Claire are caught while attempting to flee and are brought back to the complex. The helpers bring out Ryan (still tied to the chair) and shoot him dead in front of the others, and then chain Claire to the cars as they did to Anna, threatening to rip her body in half, unless she admits that her father was the abusive owner of an orphanage. She admits that her father was indeed the owner of an orphanage.\n\nParagraph 23: Antonio is extremely glum because Hecate's charm made him impotent on his wedding night. Francisca (Antonio's younger sister) enters. Left alone on stage, she reveals that she has been receiving secret nighttime visits from Aberzanes, and is now heavily pregnant. She worries that Antonio will kill her if the pregnancy is discovered. Isabella enters, not knowing of the pregnancy, and encourages Francisca to get married so she can discuss matters of a marital nature with her (Antonio's impotency is obviously on her mind). Antonio enters and Isabella sings a song for him; the lyrics of the song slyly allude to the plights of Isabella, Amoretta and Francisca. Aberzanes (\"a gentleman, neither honest, wise nor valiant\") enters. Francisca takes him aside and asks what they should do about her pregnancy. Aberzanes assures her that he has a plan. Sebastian enters disguised as a servant, \"Celio.\" Isabella introduces \"Celio\" (not knowing he is actually Sebastian) and says that she has just hired him that very morning. \"Celio\" announces the arrival of a letter from Antonio's mother in Northern Italy, asking Francisca to come immediately. (The letter is in fact a forgery by Aberzanes; this is his way of getting Francisca out of the house so she can give birth in secret.) Antonio orders Francisca to go to Northern Italy at once. Left alone on stage, Sebastian deduces from Antonio's glum demeanor that Hecate's charm worked. He is pleased, but even more desperate than before to get Isabella back. At the end of the scene, Gaspero enters with the Lord Governor (Isabella's uncle), who has come to pay Antonio a visit.\n\nParagraph 24: In April 1941, Captain Douglas Marr, the Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal of the Singapore Fortress Command, was accused of having committed \"an act of gross indecency\" with a male Malay youth, Sudin bin Daud, who denied being a \"catamite\". Sudin claimed that on 13 March or 14, he was walking along Stamford Road, a supposed \"area for male prostitutes\", at night when a car driven by Marr stopped, picked him up and brought him to his boarding house in Tanglin Hill. The offence against Section 377A allegedly took place there, he claimed, whereupon Marr gave Sudin some money and let Sudin take a watch before Sudin left, leaving his shirt there. In his defence, Marr claimed that he had wanted to get \"at the root of the homosexual type of vice and I thought, as it transpires very foolishly, that it would be a good idea to question a catamite and to try and find out to what extent soldiers in different regiments were involved\". Marr did not deny picking up Sudin, who he claimed approached him, but maintained that he merely questioned him back home to no avail, as he had mistaken Sudin for an Indian and spoken to him in Hindustani. On 16 April and 29 July, after a withdrawn appeal by the prosecution, Marr was acquitted of the charge, despite the fact that Sudin's shirt was found in his room. Sudin, who had pleaded guilty to the act of gross indecency and theft of the watch, was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment on 27 March.\n\nParagraph 25: Built of white sandstone and brick it is surrounded by a wall with a gateway. It is of two stories, supported on pillars, and a canopy with arches on each side. The lower courses of richly carved stone are of great age.

In this tale, a king and a vizir promise to marry their children to each other. The king's wife gives birth to a black serpent named Mir Mast or Khumar (M\u012bz Mast o Khum\u0101r, or \"Prince Sleepy-Head\"), and the vizir's wife to a girl they name M\u00e8r-Nig\u0101 (\"Eye of Grace\"). They marry. One night, the vizir's daughter discovers her husband is a handsome prince and asks him how to get rid of his snakeskin. The prince tells her she must burn the shed snakeskin in a special pyre, but warns her that if she does that, she will never see him again. She decides to burn the snakeskin and he curses her to never see him again until she wears down seven pairs of iron shoes. After she accomplishes the task, Mer Niga arrives at another kingdom, where she learns from a waterbearer that the castle belongs to Mir Mast's bride-to-be. Mer Niga drops her engagement ring on the waterbearer's jar she delivers to Mir Mast and the prince notices his former wife is in the castle. They meet and he gives her some strands of his hair to help her in case she needs. Mir Mast convinces his false bride to hire Mer Niga as her maid and his aunt soon sends her on difficult tasks: she receives a pearl-encrusted sweeping broom that she must use and not drop a single pearl; to sprinkle the floor with a colander; to take a casket full of insects to \"Such and Such a place\". Still on the way, Mer Niga opens the casket and hordes of insects crawl on her. Her husband appears, collects the insects and locks them up in the box again. He then advises his wife on how to proceed: she shall give a bone to a dog and straw to a horse; open a closed door and shut an open one; compliment a hollow full of dirt and blood and drop the casket there. At last, the prince's aunt forces Mer Niga to hold candles on her fingers to illuminate her husband's bridal procession. After the wedding, Mer Niga and the Snake Prince escape from his aunt's house and take some objects with them. His aunt and uncle pursue them, but the couple throw some objects behind them (tale type ATU 313, \"The Magic Flight\"), with Miz Mast o Khum\u0101r invoking God's and the Prophet Sul\u00e9m\u0101n's help, to hinder their pursuers. German scholar  classified this tale as type AaTh 425B, Der Tierbr\u00e4utigam: Die b\u00f6se Zauberin (\"The Animal Bridegroom: The Evil Sorceress\").\n\nParagraph 28: The Telecom division leveraged the 1603 processor into the heart of its original CBX. Over time, the company began to focus on digital voice, and produced some of the earliest examples of all-digital voice equipment, including Computerized Branch Exchanges (CBXs) and digital phones. Two of the most popular telecom systems were the ROLM CBX and ROLM Redwood (PBX and Key Systems Unit (KSU) models, respectively). The CBX was meant to directly compete with Northern Telecom's SL-1, AT&T Dimension telephone systems and other computerized digital-voice systems being developed at the time. By 1980, ROLM had shot past AT&T in number of systems deployed to become the #2 PBX in North America. The Redwood, often called the \"Deadwood\" by many ROLM techs because it never caught on, was intended to compete with the Nortel Norstar Key System. When Siemens bought ROLM from IBM and introduced their \"newer\" models, which were renamed Siemens switches, the early ROLM phone switches were widely pressed into service as old technology (though a number of 8000 and 9751-9005 CBXs remain online at some companies), but the digital phone handsets were quite valuable for those expanding their phone networks. The later ROLM 9200 (actually a Siemens HCM200 Hybrid system renamed) was more competition for the leading Key Systems as the 9200 had intensive Least Call Routing software, which the Redwood did not. The company also produced one of the first commercially successful voicemail systems, PhoneMail. Digital ROLM telephones, called ROLMphones, were unique from other telephones in many ways, one of which was a lack of a physical switchhook button. Instead, the handset contains a small magnet which triggers a switch in the phone base. The opening or closing of this switch lets the phone and system know if the phone is on hook (not in use) or off-hook (in use).\n\nParagraph 29: A local peasant from a Chinese village was found murdered, hacked to death by a hand sickle. The use of a sickle, a tool used by peasants to cut the rice at harvest time, suggested that another local peasant worker had committed the murder. The local magistrate began the investigation by calling all the local peasants who could be suspects into the village square. Each was to carry their hand sickles to the town square with them. Once assembled, the magistrate ordered the ten-or-so suspects to place their hand sickles on the ground in front of them and then step back a few yards. The afternoon sun was warm and as the villagers, suspects, and magistrates waited, bright shiny metallic green flies began to buzz around them in the village square. The shiny metallic colored flies then began to focus in on one of the hand sickles lying on the ground. Within just a few minutes many had landed on the hand sickle and were crawling over it with interest. None of the other hand sickles had attracted any of these pretty flies. The owner of the tool became very nervous, and it was only a few more moments before all those in the village knew who the murderer was. With head hung in shame and pleading for mercy, the magistrate led the murderer away. The witnesses of the murder were the brightly metallic colored flies known as the blow flies which had been attracted to the remaining bits of soft tissue, blood, bone and hair which had stuck to the hand sickle after the murder was committed. The knowledge of the village magistrate as to a specific insect group's behavior regarding their attraction to dead human tissue was the key to solving this violent act and justice was served in ancient China.\n\nParagraph 30: Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez Ram\u00edrez (born 1942 in Tuxpan, Veracruz) is a Mexican businessman. He is a former CEO of Banco Nacional de M\u00e9xico (Banamex), Mexico's second largest bank, just after BBVA Bancomer, from Spain. He was a member of the board of Citigroup. Chairman of the Board, Banco Nacional de Mexico, S.A. - 1991 to present and is currently the Honorary Chairman. He cofounded with Alfredo Harp, Acciones y Valores de M\u00e9xico, S.A. DE C.V. The brokerage house that later acquired Banamex. He was: Chairman of the Board, Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A. de C.V. (Mexican Stock Exchange) - 1974 to 1979, Director - 1972 to 2003; Member of the International Advisory Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Chairman, Asociacion Mexicana de Bancos (Mexican Bankers Association) - 1993 to 1994; Member, Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A. de C.V. - 1967 to 1986; Director of Citigroup from 2001 to 2009; Other Directorships , Grupo Televisa, S.A., (until 2021)\n\nParagraph 31: In Bengal, Varthma met a pair of Chinese Christian merchants. This passage has provoked various conjectures by historians since. According to Varthema, the pair were from the \"city of Sarnau\", and that there were \"many other Christian lords\" like them there, all of them \"subjects of the Great Khan of Cathay\". The location of Sarnau is unclear. The name does not show up on contemporary maps, but appears in a few other travelogues of the time. Some (e.g. Fra Oderico) claim Sarnau is in northern China, but others (e.g. Giovanni da Empoli, Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto) suggest it is located in Indochina. The most frequent suggestion is that Sarnau is the Thai capital city of Ayutthaya. The term \"Sarnau\" may just be a transcription of the Persian term \"Shar-i Nau\", meaning \"New City\", the name by which Ayutthaya was also known at the time. There is no contradiction in their statement about Cathay: the Ayutthaya kingdom, like most other kingdoms of Indochina, had been notionally tributary to the Chinese emperor. Their identification as \"Christian\" and \"many other Christian lords\" may seem puzzling as Christianity was not known to have reached Thailand at this time. However, Nestorian Christian communities had spread in Central Asia and China with the Mongol Empire, and the persecutions after the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368 may have prompted an exodus of Nestorian Christian refugees to Indochina. Later in the travelogue, Varthema notes the ruler of Pegu (Burma) had an entire regiment of such Christians. However, Varthema claims they are \"as white as us\" and \"write in a contrary way to us, in the manner of the Armenians\". Setting aside the latter error (Armenian is written from left to right, like Latin script), Varthema may have meant Syriac script, implying these were most likely ethnically Central Asian or Persian Nestorian Christians, who moved to China during the Yuan dynasty, and later found their way to Indochina. However, it does not rule out that they may simply have been Chinese or Thai converts - Varthema uses the term \"white\" repeatedly to describe Southeast Asians (in contrast to South Asians).\n\nParagraph 32:  The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old \"standing buffalo\" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue \"charging buffalo\" logo. Later that season, the Cowboys used the \"double-star\" uniform, which could be considered an updated version of the 1960s jerseys. Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red \"standing buffalo\" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the AFL-era jerseys as opposed to the Jim Kelly/Marv Levy-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The New York Jets also received similar criticism for using their throwback logo on their then-current green helmets; when they adopted the throwback design full-time in 1998, they also went back to their original-style white helmets. The Bills and Cowboys did the same when they adopted their retro unis.\n\nParagraph 33: During his medical and teaching career, Bowen also got into Republican Party politics, serving as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1960 to 1972. He was speaker of the house from 1967 to 1972, vice chairman of the legislative council from 1967 to 1968, and chairman until 1972. After his first unsuccessful attempt in the Republican primary in 1968, he was elected Governor of Indiana in 1972 and was re-elected for a second term in 1976, making him the first Governor to serve for eight consecutive years in Indiana since 1851. His campaign slogan, featured in huge letters on billboards, was \"Otis Bowen. He Hears You\".  His tenure in Indiana's highest public office was marked by a major tax restructuring reducing reliance on property taxes, major improvements to state park facilities, development of a statewide emergency medical services system, and adoption of a medical malpractice law that was destined to become a national model. From 1978 to 1985, he also served on the board of trustees for Valparaiso University. Simultaneously, Bowen served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, the Midwestern Governors Association, and the National Governors Association. In 1980, he served as President of the Council of State Governments.\n\nParagraph 34: The story is about a Lamut (Evens) named Turgen whose family was killed by an illness which left him alone to his practice of medicine in his Yurt. He then out of his loneliness befriends a group of rams near his yurt this cause the townspeople to look at him and start strange rumors that it is impossible for a man to befriend animals so he must be a sorcerer and shunned because of it. While on coming back from his usual fishing and hunting round he hears crying and decides to help he goes inside the yurt to see 2 children. The eldest one Tim approached Turgen and with all his kindness stayed to tend to the youngest child Aska as she was only but an infant. As time past Marfa the mother of the children came from working to see Turgen tending to her children rather than being angry she was just surprised to find him in her home. As it turns out one of the people who didn't listen to the shamans words was Marfa's late husband who left marfa with some enlightening information that Turgen was a kind man that helped anyone that needed and that the shaman only spoke lies and this was proven to her as she came to see him tending to her children. From that point he frequently dropped by to see Marfa and he children bringing them meats, and salts to make sure that marfa did not need to work so hard and with that she was able to spend more time with her children. With these visits Turgen's story about his past affiliation with the rams on how he hunted them for sport and that cause great sorrow in him to see these creatures being hunter for their horns and meats even though they were minding their own business. With this gap of trust between them Turgen set out to create a wall of trust with the ram which he achieved by feeding them every day. As time passed he began to bond with the herd of ram and watched them as they at his food offering and when the rams had encounters with other dangerous creatures like bears and wolves Turgen did everything in his power to help the rams with their fight even if it meant risking his life. In the middle of September hunting season began this is where Turgen's struggle's begin as hunters start to come to the mountains and they are specifically looking for the rams to hunt. Turgen places the responsibilities of guiding the rams to a safer spot in the mountains. With the help of Marfa and her children he was able to lead the rams to safety while being watched by the hunter they threaten his life because of his actions. This is when Marfa stood up and pleaded to hunter to listen to reason and why Turgen had see the rams through. As they listen they were reminded of the shamans words and ignored er words this is when Turgen stood and talk sense to the hunter and told them how the shamans words should not be headed since he was visited by spirit for helping the rams as the Lamut were very religious they believed a spirit haunted Turgen and now believed he was free since the rams were gone. In the end Turgen was accepted back to the village and married Marfa and was able to live normal life.\n\nParagraph 35:  The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old \"standing buffalo\" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue \"charging buffalo\" logo. Later that season, the Cowboys used the \"double-star\" uniform, which could be considered an updated version of the 1960s jerseys. Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red \"standing buffalo\" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the AFL-era jerseys as opposed to the Jim Kelly/Marv Levy-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The New York Jets also received similar criticism for using their throwback logo on their then-current green helmets; when they adopted the throwback design full-time in 1998, they also went back to their original-style white helmets. The Bills and Cowboys did the same when they adopted their retro unis.\n\nParagraph 36: Antonio is extremely glum because Hecate's charm made him impotent on his wedding night. Francisca (Antonio's younger sister) enters. Left alone on stage, she reveals that she has been receiving secret nighttime visits from Aberzanes, and is now heavily pregnant. She worries that Antonio will kill her if the pregnancy is discovered. Isabella enters, not knowing of the pregnancy, and encourages Francisca to get married so she can discuss matters of a marital nature with her (Antonio's impotency is obviously on her mind). Antonio enters and Isabella sings a song for him; the lyrics of the song slyly allude to the plights of Isabella, Amoretta and Francisca. Aberzanes (\"a gentleman, neither honest, wise nor valiant\") enters. Francisca takes him aside and asks what they should do about her pregnancy. Aberzanes assures her that he has a plan. Sebastian enters disguised as a servant, \"Celio.\" Isabella introduces \"Celio\" (not knowing he is actually Sebastian) and says that she has just hired him that very morning. \"Celio\" announces the arrival of a letter from Antonio's mother in Northern Italy, asking Francisca to come immediately. (The letter is in fact a forgery by Aberzanes; this is his way of getting Francisca out of the house so she can give birth in secret.) Antonio orders Francisca to go to Northern Italy at once. Left alone on stage, Sebastian deduces from Antonio's glum demeanor that Hecate's charm worked. He is pleased, but even more desperate than before to get Isabella back. At the end of the scene, Gaspero enters with the Lord Governor (Isabella's uncle), who has come to pay Antonio a visit.\n\nParagraph 37: In January 1986, while he was now working under Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation, Duggan would once again venture overseas to New Japan, now wrestling in their New Year Dash tour, coincidentally facing Inoki once again in the first day of their tour on January 3, this time ending in a double count-out. Duggan, a now more established wrestler, was receiving a lot of good results during the tour, clashing with main eventers such as Fujinami, Sakaguchi, Kimura and Choshu to draws, and dominating young lions such as Tatsutoshi Goto and Yang-Seung Hi. He also wrestled tag-team action during the series, teaming with the likes of Tony St. Clair, Johnny Mantell, Black Tiger, Mike Miller and the twin-team of Madd Maxx (1 & 2), with the majority of them ending in the losing end for Duggan's team. Duggan would tour one last time overseas in September of the same year, wrestling on New Japan's Challenge Spirit tour, resuming his encounters against Inoki, Fujinami, Kimura and Sakaguchi, as well as facing Umanosuke Ueda and George Takano in tag-team matches, teaming once again with Madd Maxx, Jerry Gray and The Angel Of Death. His last match came against Seiji Sakaguchi in a double count-out.\n\nParagraph 38: Maas was the Chiefs first-round draft pick in 1984, the fifth player taken overall.  He lived up to his first-round status, being named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year despite missing two games. After a career-high seven sacks in 1985, he matched that total the next season and was awarded his first Pro Bowl nod. He went back again to the Pro Bowl in the strike-shortened 1987 season after getting six sacks and scoring a touchdown off of a fumble recovery. Maas got off to a fast start in 1988, getting four sacks and a safety in his first seven games. He then got hurt in the eighth game and missed the rest of the season. The 1989 season was the first year in his career he did not have a sack, as it was shortened to 10 games because of injury. He did score the last touchdown of his career off of a fumble. Kansas City moved him to defensive end in 1990. He had 5.5 sacks and a safety that season. After an injury-filled 1992 season, he joined the Green Bay Packers. He spent most of the year backing up John Jurkovic at nose tackle.\n\nParagraph 39: The emerging market credit linked note, also sometimes called a \u201cclean,\u201d are traded by buy side clients to gain access to local debt markets for several reasons.  First, is that a direct investment in the sovereign debt may not be legal due to domicile restrictions of the country.  One instance would be the local government requiring the purchaser of debt to have a business office in the country, another instance would be tax restrictions or tariffs in countries with NDF currencies.  A fund in USD would have difficulty repatriating the currency if local restrictions or taxes made it undesirable.  When this occurs, the sell side global bank purchases the debt and structures it into a derivative note then issued to the client or clients.  The client then owns the issued security, which derives its total return from the underlying instrument.  A CDS, credit default swap, is embedded in the instrument.  It can be thought of as a fully funded total return swap where the underlying asset total return is exchanged for a funding fee as well as the cost of the issued CLN.  From a market risk perspective owning a CLN is almost identical to owning the local debt.  \n\nParagraph 40: A local peasant from a Chinese village was found murdered, hacked to death by a hand sickle. The use of a sickle, a tool used by peasants to cut the rice at harvest time, suggested that another local peasant worker had committed the murder. The local magistrate began the investigation by calling all the local peasants who could be suspects into the village square. Each was to carry their hand sickles to the town square with them. Once assembled, the magistrate ordered the ten-or-so suspects to place their hand sickles on the ground in front of them and then step back a few yards. The afternoon sun was warm and as the villagers, suspects, and magistrates waited, bright shiny metallic green flies began to buzz around them in the village square. The shiny metallic colored flies then began to focus in on one of the hand sickles lying on the ground. Within just a few minutes many had landed on the hand sickle and were crawling over it with interest. None of the other hand sickles had attracted any of these pretty flies. The owner of the tool became very nervous, and it was only a few more moments before all those in the village knew who the murderer was. With head hung in shame and pleading for mercy, the magistrate led the murderer away. The witnesses of the murder were the brightly metallic colored flies known as the blow flies which had been attracted to the remaining bits of soft tissue, blood, bone and hair which had stuck to the hand sickle after the murder was committed. The knowledge of the village magistrate as to a specific insect group's behavior regarding their attraction to dead human tissue was the key to solving this violent act and justice was served in ancient China.\n\nParagraph 41: Prosanto Mullick is a well-known and successful businessman. He is so much in love with Debi, his wife that he readily walks out of a business meeting where the deal amounts to around Rs.7 crore when a telephone call from home informs that she is ill. She is all decked up and ready to wish him happy wedding anniversary, piano, song and all. The tell-tale white streaks in her hair show that they have been married for a while. She faints as the song ends and you\u2019ve guessed it \u2013 she is pregnant. But hubby dear is not happy. When she delivers twins, he hates to share her with them. Enter villain Charandas, an old friend of Prosanto who had the twitters for Debi but is out to avenge the stinging slap she gave him before he went to jail. He wants to set up a business. Prosanto writes out a cheque for Rs.3 crore. But Charandas\u2019 intentions are different. He kidnaps the older of the twins but to avoid being caught by the neighbourhood public, dumps the baby into the community dustbin and makes good his escape. Rahmat, the neighbourhood thief, picks up the infant, takes him home and brings him up, without keeping the story of how he found him a secret. Debi suspects that her husband of the kidnap because she finds his wrist-watch on the floor. During a heated argument, she falls off the stairs, loses her sanity and is placed in a mental home. Prosanto is jailed for 14 years and in the meanwhile, the kidnapped twin who has named himself Arjun, grows up to become the modern Robin Hood of the locality, fighting the bad ones for justice. Nandini, Charandas\u2019 beautiful daughter, falls in love with him at first sight when he steps into her marriage mandap and rescues her from marriage to a politician\u2019s villainous son. Though he does his quota of singing and dancing, he longs for the mother he thinks threw him away and feels a strange pull towards the crazy Debi when Prosanto, out of jail, asks him to help him fight Charandas for revenge. Around this time, the second twin, Akash, flies back home with a degree in psychiatric medicine under his arm. He wants to cure his mother and also falls in love with a fellow-passenger on his way back home. Some more singing and dancing follows while Arjun becomes a trusted aide of Prosanto, each one unaware of the father-son tie they are bound by. With a great deal of action scenes filled with fights, fisticuffs, breaking of ropes and so on, Charandas is defeated in his devious plans of decimating the family he hates, Debi is cured completely, Arjun and Nandini are united, blood ties are reinforced, and you just wait to hear the still photographer say \u2018smile\u2019 for the last group photograph.\n\nParagraph 42: In 1965, M\u00e9zi\u00e8res arranged a working visa through a friend of Jij\u00e9's who had a factory in Houston, Texas. In the end, however, he never took up the job in Houston. After staying in New York for a few months, the call of the West proved too strong and eventually he ended up hitchhiking across the country, first to Seattle and then to Montana (where he worked on a ranch driving tractors, laying posts and cleaning stables) before ending up in San Francisco. His initial plan was to find work in an advertising agency in San Francisco but he ran foul of the Immigration Service who told him that his visa was good for working in the factory in Houston and nowhere else. He quickly left San Francisco in search of an authentic \"Wild West\" cowboy experience. Arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah with no money, he sought out Pierre Christin, who was living there while teaching at the University of Utah, and turned up on his doorstep asking him if he could sleep on his settee. To make ends meet, M\u00e9zi\u00e8res produced some illustrations for a small advertising agency in Salt Lake City and for a Mormon children's magazine called Children's Friend as well as selling some photographs he had taken while working on the ranch in Montana. After a few months, he found work on a ranch in Utah: this time succeeding in his aspiration of living the life of a cowboy, an experience he described as \"better than in my dreams\".\n\nParagraph 43: In April 1941, Captain Douglas Marr, the Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal of the Singapore Fortress Command, was accused of having committed \"an act of gross indecency\" with a male Malay youth, Sudin bin Daud, who denied being a \"catamite\". Sudin claimed that on 13 March or 14, he was walking along Stamford Road, a supposed \"area for male prostitutes\", at night when a car driven by Marr stopped, picked him up and brought him to his boarding house in Tanglin Hill. The offence against Section 377A allegedly took place there, he claimed, whereupon Marr gave Sudin some money and let Sudin take a watch before Sudin left, leaving his shirt there. In his defence, Marr claimed that he had wanted to get \"at the root of the homosexual type of vice and I thought, as it transpires very foolishly, that it would be a good idea to question a catamite and to try and find out to what extent soldiers in different regiments were involved\". Marr did not deny picking up Sudin, who he claimed approached him, but maintained that he merely questioned him back home to no avail, as he had mistaken Sudin for an Indian and spoken to him in Hindustani. On 16 April and 29 July, after a withdrawn appeal by the prosecution, Marr was acquitted of the charge, despite the fact that Sudin's shirt was found in his room. Sudin, who had pleaded guilty to the act of gross indecency and theft of the watch, was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment on 27 March.\n\nParagraph 44: Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa heard of the South Sea from natives while sailing along the Caribbean coast. On 25 September 1513 his expedition became the first Europeans to see the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. In 1519 the town of Panam\u00e1 was founded near a small indigenous settlement on the Pacific coast. After the Spanish colonization of Peru, it developed into an important port of trade and became an administrative centre. In 1671 the Welsh privateer Henry Morgan crossed the Isthmus of Panam\u00e1 from the Caribbean side and destroyed the city. The town was relocated some kilometers to the west at a small peninsula. The ruins of the old town, Panam\u00e1 Viejo, are preserved and were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.\n\nParagraph 45: In Bengal, Varthma met a pair of Chinese Christian merchants. This passage has provoked various conjectures by historians since. According to Varthema, the pair were from the \"city of Sarnau\", and that there were \"many other Christian lords\" like them there, all of them \"subjects of the Great Khan of Cathay\". The location of Sarnau is unclear. The name does not show up on contemporary maps, but appears in a few other travelogues of the time. Some (e.g. Fra Oderico) claim Sarnau is in northern China, but others (e.g. Giovanni da Empoli, Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto) suggest it is located in Indochina. The most frequent suggestion is that Sarnau is the Thai capital city of Ayutthaya. The term \"Sarnau\" may just be a transcription of the Persian term \"Shar-i Nau\", meaning \"New City\", the name by which Ayutthaya was also known at the time. There is no contradiction in their statement about Cathay: the Ayutthaya kingdom, like most other kingdoms of Indochina, had been notionally tributary to the Chinese emperor. Their identification as \"Christian\" and \"many other Christian lords\" may seem puzzling as Christianity was not known to have reached Thailand at this time. However, Nestorian Christian communities had spread in Central Asia and China with the Mongol Empire, and the persecutions after the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368 may have prompted an exodus of Nestorian Christian refugees to Indochina. Later in the travelogue, Varthema notes the ruler of Pegu (Burma) had an entire regiment of such Christians. However, Varthema claims they are \"as white as us\" and \"write in a contrary way to us, in the manner of the Armenians\". Setting aside the latter error (Armenian is written from left to right, like Latin script), Varthema may have meant Syriac script, implying these were most likely ethnically Central Asian or Persian Nestorian Christians, who moved to China during the Yuan dynasty, and later found their way to Indochina. However, it does not rule out that they may simply have been Chinese or Thai converts - Varthema uses the term \"white\" repeatedly to describe Southeast Asians (in contrast to South Asians).\n\nParagraph 46: In 1987, Wright moved to the Nomads senior team, the San Diego Nomads which played in the Western Soccer Alliance. The Nomads won the league championship that season and again in 1988. In 1990, the WSA merged with the east-coast based American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). The Nomads spend one season in the APSL before leaving the league. In 1989, the Cleveland Crunch of the Major Indoor Soccer League drafted Wright with the sixth pick of the expansion draft.  On March 6, 1990, the Crunch traded Wright to the San Diego Sockers. The Sockers, perennial contenders, won the MISL championship that season with Wright named as the Championship Series Unsung Hero. Wright remained in San Diego until the MISL collapsed in 1992. On January 7, 1993, Wright signed with the Milwaukee Wave of the National Professional Soccer League (NSPL). Although the Wave failed to make the playoffs, Wright's forty-five goals in twenty-five games led to his selection as a first team All Star. That summer Wright signed with the Los Angeles Salsa of the outdoor American Professional Soccer League. In October, 1993, the Salsa loaned Wright to the Baltimore Blast of the NPSL. Wright was back the Salsa for the summer 1994 season, but after the Salsa folded that fall, he signed with the Wichita Wings of the NPSL for the 1994\u20131995 season. Wright would not return to the NPSL until 1999. In 1993, Wright signed with the Los Angeles Salsa of the outdoor American Professional Soccer League. He had not played outdoor soccer since playing with the Nomads in 1990, but this did not stop Wright from finishing second in points and goals to team mate Paulinho Crici\u00fama, being named a first team All Star.  In 1994, Wright led the league in scoring, tying Paulhino for the points lead. He was again selected as a first team All Star.  After playing with the Baltimore Blast during the 1994\u20131995 winter indoor season, Wright did not return to the APSL, but instead signed with the Sacramento Knights of the Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL). The CISL played a summer indoor schedule. In December 1995, Major League Soccer announced it had signed Wright to a league contract. In preparation for its first season, MLS signed players to contracts, then distributed these players through the league via an initial allocation and an inaugural player draft. In February 1996, the Kansas City Wizards selected Wright in the third round (twenty-fifth overall) of the 1996 MLS Supplemental Draft. He spent four seasons in Kansas City. When the Wizards released him in 1999, Wright signed with the Western Mass Pioneers where he played four outdoor seasons. In the fall of 1999, he returned to the Baltimore Blast in the NPSL. He spent most of three seasons in Baltimore, but saw time in seven games with the Philadelphia KiXX during the 2000\u20132001 season. In February 2002, the Blast waived Wright, who was leading the team in scoring at the time. The San Diego Sockers quickly signed Wright in preparation for the team's move to the new Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). In October 2002, he signed another year-long contract and remained with the Sockers until it discontinued operations in December 2005. On January 5, 2005, the Chicago Storm selected Wright in the MISL Dispersal Draft. Wright both owns an athletic training company, Speed to Burn. In April 2006, he joined the San Diego Fusion of the amateur fourth division National Premier Soccer League. In 2009, he signed with the San Diego Sockers of the Professional Arena Soccer League. In May 2011, it was announced he signed with a new team in the PASL, the Anaheim Bolts. In October 2012, he re-signed with the San Diego Sockers for the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nParagraph 47: In August 1373, John of Gaunt, accompanied by John de Montfort, Duke of Brittany led a force of 9,000 men out from Calais on a major chevauch\u00e9e.  While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English began to meet further resistance as they moved south.  French forces began to concentrate around the English force but, under specific orders from King Charles V, the French avoided a set battle.  Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves being trapped against the River Allier by four separate French forces.  With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at Moulins but lost all their baggage and loot.  The English carried on south across the Limousin plateau but the weather turned severe.  Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour.  At the beginning of December, the army finally entered friendly territory in Gascony.  By the end of December they were in Bordeaux, starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais.  Although the march across France had been a remarkable feat, it was a military failure.\n\nParagraph 48: A technicality resulted in Archer's being denied a third try at the Melbourne Cup. His telegraphed acceptance to race failed to arrive in time (delivery was delayed due to a public holiday in Melbourne), and Archer was refused permission to enter the race. Nominations for the 1863 Melbourne Cup had to be lodged with the Victorian Turf Club by Wednesday, 29 April, accompanied by five gold sovereigns. De Mestre had nominated two of his horses, Archer and Haidee. Weights were declared and published in Bell's Life in Sydney on Saturday, 9 May. Archer was to carry 11\u00a0st 4\u00a0lb (71.82\u00a0kg, or 158\u00a0lb) - which, if he had raced, would have been the heaviest handicap in the history of the Melbourne Cup. Under the care of groom and trainer Tom Lamond Archer and Haidee steamed to Melbourne, leaving Sydney on the City Of Melbourne Tuesday, 16 June. Acceptance, with an additional five-sovereign payment, had to be lodged with the VTC by 8pm Wednesday, 1 July; de Mestre (still in Sydney) had overlooked the deadline. Reminded on the morning of 1 July  by Sam Jenner of George Kirk & Co. of the deadline, de Mestre requested a telegram be sent to the Melbourne office of George Kirk & Co. asking them to accept on his behalf. De Mestre took the telegram to the telegraph office himself, and it was received in the Melbourne Telegraph Office at 1 pm. Wednesday, 1 July was a public holiday in Melbourne, and the telegram was not delivered to the George Kirk & Co. offices until 7:30 pm. The next morning George Kirk handed the telegram to the stewards at the Turf Club, who decided it was too late. This decision caused controversy amongst Archer's Sydney supporters, who had expected him to win. Pressure by Victorian owners made no difference to the VTC, which stood its ground. To protest this decision and show solidarity, the interstate entrants boycotted the third Cup. Unknown at the time, however, was that due to injury Archer would have been unlikely to race. The third Melbourne Cup ran with only seven Victoria horses, the smallest number in its history.\n\nPlease enter the final count of unique paragraphs after removing duplicates. The output format should only contain the number, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on.\n\nThe final answer is: ", "input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Oliver Crangle is a hate-ridden fanatic who lives in an apartment with his parrot Pete. He maintains records of people he believes to be \"evil\" and has convinced himself that the so called \"evil\" people (communists, subversives, thieves, murderers) are engaged in a world wide conspiracy and have taken over Washington. He makes phone calls to them and their employers at all hours, writes letters regarding their actions, demands their prompt firing, and threatens to involve higher authorities if they do not comply. Unsatisfied with the results of his anonymous calls and letters, he searches for a more effective way to eliminate evil from the world; he settles on the idea of shrinking all evil people to two feet tall. Throughout the episode, Crangle's parrot Pete periodically calls out \"nut,\" asking for a nut to eat, which Crangle gives him, not realizing that Pete is unintentionally calling Crangle a \"nut.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Eventually, the agents find footage of Division agent Aaron Keener going rogue and killing other agents, having gone insane after witnessing the chaos and destruction caused during the breakdown of order following the initial outbreak. It is also discovered Keener and the rest of the first wave of agents who went rogue along with him are assisting the \"Last Man Battalion\" (LMB), an equally rogue private military company that was abandoned by the government during the evacuation, and are now hostile to it. Working together, these two groups destroyed the VTOL and killed the Commander to weaken Division operations in New York. Intercepting a signal from the Russian consulate, the agents attempt to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a Russian virologist who claims to have information on the Green Poison. However, he is kidnapped by Keener and the LMB before the Division can reach him. After helping the JTF secure supplies and weapons, the JTF and Division agents launch an attack on the LMB's base, the now-evacuated United Nations headquarters. The agent finds footage of Keener and his fellow rogue agents abandoning the LMB, with Tchernenko as their prisoner. The leader of the LMB, Charles Bliss, initially escapes in a helicopter, but then returns to make a final stand alongside his men. In the end, the agent destroys the vehicle, killing Bliss. Lau informs the agent that most threats are destroyed or weakened, however the LMB was split into factions. New York is approaching stability, but an unknown signal leads the agent to a secluded laboratory. There, they find Dr. Amherst's remains, having discovered that he has died from exposure to his own virus. They also find a message from Keener, showing he has the technology to manufacture a new strain of Green Poison and intends to do so, and mysteriously tells the agent to explore the center of Manhattan, called the \u201cDark Zone.\u201d The agent is informed that the information in the lab will further the development of a vaccine and is shown a recovered message from Amherst. In the message, Amherst reveals he engineered Green Poison as part of his eco-terrorist plan to decimate the human race and preserve the planet. If the player follows Keener's instructions, they will discover a message from Keener claiming that he plans to continue with Amherst's plot, as he has come to worship the virus as the judge of all humanity and plans to reverse engineer and improve it; he then offers the player a position beside him based on their actions in the Dark Zone.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1987, Wright moved to the Nomads senior team, the San Diego Nomads which played in the Western Soccer Alliance.

To make ends meet, M\u00e9zi\u00e8res produced some illustrations for a small advertising agency in Salt Lake City and for a Mormon children's magazine called Children's Friend as well as selling some photographs he had taken while working on the ranch in Montana. After a few months, he found work on a ranch in Utah: this time succeeding in his aspiration of living the life of a cowboy, an experience he described as \"better than in my dreams\".\n\nParagraph 5: This symbology, derived from the RM4SCC system used by the British Royal Mail, uses a series of bars, each of which can individually have one of four possible states, to encode information used in automated sortation and delivery onto each piece of mail.  Each bar can either be short and centred (known as a tracker), medium and elevated (an ascender), medium and lowered (a descender), or full height.  This symbology also uses an element known as a Data Content Identifier (or DCI), which specifies what types of information are encoded into each barcode, such as postal codes, customer information, and exact delivery points.  The information that goes into each barcode is obtained from the address printed on the front of the envelope it is ultimately printed on, as well as the physical dimensions of each piece of mail.  This code also uses a Reed-Solomon error correction technique, so that in case a particular piece of mail is mishandled, the information encoded in the barcode can still be correctly decoded.\n\nParagraph 6: During his medical and teaching career, Bowen also got into Republican Party politics, serving as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1960 to 1972. He was speaker of the house from 1967 to 1972, vice chairman of the legislative council from 1967 to 1968, and chairman until 1972. After his first unsuccessful attempt in the Republican primary in 1968, he was elected Governor of Indiana in 1972 and was re-elected for a second term in 1976, making him the first Governor to serve for eight consecutive years in Indiana since 1851. His campaign slogan, featured in huge letters on billboards, was \"Otis Bowen. He Hears You\".  His tenure in Indiana's highest public office was marked by a major tax restructuring reducing reliance on property taxes, major improvements to state park facilities, development of a statewide emergency medical services system, and adoption of a medical malpractice law that was destined to become a national model. From 1978 to 1985, he also served on the board of trustees for Valparaiso University. Simultaneously, Bowen served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, the Midwestern Governors Association, and the National Governors Association. In 1980, he served as President of the Council of State Governments.\n\nParagraph 7:  The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old \"standing buffalo\" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue \"charging buffalo\" logo. Later that season, the Cowboys used the \"double-star\" uniform, which could be considered an updated version of the 1960s jerseys. Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red \"standing buffalo\" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the AFL-era jerseys as opposed to the Jim Kelly/Marv Levy-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The New York Jets also received similar criticism for using their throwback logo on their then-current green helmets; when they adopted the throwback design full-time in 1998, they also went back to their original-style white helmets. The Bills and Cowboys did the same when they adopted their retro unis.\n\nParagraph 8: Maas was the Chiefs first-round draft pick in 1984, the fifth player taken overall.  He lived up to his first-round status, being named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year despite missing two games. After a career-high seven sacks in 1985, he matched that total the next season and was awarded his first Pro Bowl nod. He went back again to the Pro Bowl in the strike-shortened 1987 season after getting six sacks and scoring a touchdown off of a fumble recovery. Maas got off to a fast start in 1988, getting four sacks and a safety in his first seven games. He then got hurt in the eighth game and missed the rest of the season. The 1989 season was the first year in his career he did not have a sack, as it was shortened to 10 games because of injury. He did score the last touchdown of his career off of a fumble. Kansas City moved him to defensive end in 1990. He had 5.5 sacks and a safety that season. After an injury-filled 1992 season, he joined the Green Bay Packers. He spent most of the year backing up John Jurkovic at nose tackle.\n\nParagraph 9: This symbology, derived from the RM4SCC system used by the British Royal Mail, uses a series of bars, each of which can individually have one of four possible states, to encode information used in automated sortation and delivery onto each piece of mail.

His telegraphed acceptance to race failed to arrive in time (delivery was delayed due to a public holiday in Melbourne), and Archer was refused permission to enter the race. Nominations for the 1863 Melbourne Cup had to be lodged with the Victorian Turf Club by Wednesday, 29 April, accompanied by five gold sovereigns. De Mestre had nominated two of his horses, Archer and Haidee. Weights were declared and published in Bell's Life in Sydney on Saturday, 9 May. Archer was to carry 11\u00a0st 4\u00a0lb (71.82\u00a0kg, or 158\u00a0lb) - which, if he had raced, would have been the heaviest handicap in the history of the Melbourne Cup. Under the care of groom and trainer Tom Lamond Archer and Haidee steamed to Melbourne, leaving Sydney on the City Of Melbourne Tuesday, 16 June. Acceptance, with an additional five-sovereign payment, had to be lodged with the VTC by 8pm Wednesday, 1 July; de Mestre (still in Sydney) had overlooked the deadline. Reminded on the morning of 1 July  by Sam Jenner of George Kirk & Co. of the deadline, de Mestre requested a telegram be sent to the Melbourne office of George Kirk & Co. asking them to accept on his behalf. De Mestre took the telegram to the telegraph office himself, and it was received in the Melbourne Telegraph Office at 1 pm. Wednesday, 1 July was a public holiday in Melbourne, and the telegram was not delivered to the George Kirk & Co. offices until 7:30 pm. The next morning George Kirk handed the telegram to the stewards at the Turf Club, who decided it was too late. This decision caused controversy amongst Archer's Sydney supporters, who had expected him to win. Pressure by Victorian owners made no difference to the VTC, which stood its ground. To protest this decision and show solidarity, the interstate entrants boycotted the third Cup. Unknown at the time, however, was that due to injury Archer would have been unlikely to race. The third Melbourne Cup ran with only seven Victoria horses, the smallest number in its history.\n\nParagraph 11: Prosanto Mullick is a well-known and successful businessman. He is so much in love with Debi, his wife that he readily walks out of a business meeting where the deal amounts to around Rs.7 crore when a telephone call from home informs that she is ill. She is all decked up and ready to wish him happy wedding anniversary, piano, song and all. The tell-tale white streaks in her hair show that they have been married for a while. She faints as the song ends and you\u2019ve guessed it \u2013 she is pregnant. But hubby dear is not happy. When she delivers twins, he hates to share her with them. Enter villain Charandas, an old friend of Prosanto who had the twitters for Debi but is out to avenge the stinging slap she gave him before he went to jail. He wants to set up a business. Prosanto writes out a cheque for Rs.3 crore. But Charandas\u2019 intentions are different. He kidnaps the older of the twins but to avoid being caught by the neighbourhood public, dumps the baby into the community dustbin and makes good his escape. Rahmat, the neighbourhood thief, picks up the infant, takes him home and brings him up, without keeping the story of how he found him a secret. Debi suspects that her husband of the kidnap because she finds his wrist-watch on the floor. During a heated argument, she falls off the stairs, loses her sanity and is placed in a mental home. Prosanto is jailed for 14 years and in the meanwhile, the kidnapped twin who has named himself Arjun, grows up to become the modern Robin Hood of the locality, fighting the bad ones for justice. Nandini, Charandas\u2019 beautiful daughter, falls in love with him at first sight when he steps into her marriage mandap and rescues her from marriage to a politician\u2019s villainous son. Though he does his quota of singing and dancing, he longs for the mother he thinks threw him away and feels a strange pull towards the crazy Debi when Prosanto, out of jail, asks him to help him fight Charandas for revenge. Around this time, the second twin, Akash, flies back home with a degree in psychiatric medicine under his arm. He wants to cure his mother and also falls in love with a fellow-passenger on his way back home. Some more singing and dancing follows while Arjun becomes a trusted aide of Prosanto, each one unaware of the father-son tie they are bound by. With a great deal of action scenes filled with fights, fisticuffs, breaking of ropes and so on, Charandas is defeated in his devious plans of decimating the family he hates, Debi is cured completely, Arjun and Nandini are united, blood ties are reinforced, and you just wait to hear the still photographer say \u2018smile\u2019 for the last group photograph.\n\nParagraph 12: In Bengal, Varthma met a pair of Chinese Christian merchants. This passage has provoked various conjectures by historians since. According to Varthema, the pair were from the \"city of Sarnau\", and that there were \"many other Christian lords\" like them there, all of them \"subjects of the Great Khan of Cathay\". The location of Sarnau is unclear. The name does not show up on contemporary maps, but appears in a few other travelogues of the time. Some (e.g. Fra Oderico) claim Sarnau is in northern China, but others (e.g. Giovanni da Empoli, Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto) suggest it is located in Indochina. The most frequent suggestion is that Sarnau is the Thai capital city of Ayutthaya. The term \"Sarnau\" may just be a transcription of the Persian term \"Shar-i Nau\", meaning \"New City\", the name by which Ayutthaya was also known at the time. There is no contradiction in their statement about Cathay: the Ayutthaya kingdom, like most other kingdoms of Indochina, had been notionally tributary to the Chinese emperor. Their identification as \"Christian\" and \"many other Christian lords\" may seem puzzling as Christianity was not known to have reached Thailand at this time. However, Nestorian Christian communities had spread in Central Asia and China with the Mongol Empire, and the persecutions after the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368 may have prompted an exodus of Nestorian Christian refugees to Indochina. Later in the travelogue, Varthema notes the ruler of Pegu (Burma) had an entire regiment of such Christians. However, Varthema claims they are \"as white as us\" and \"write in a contrary way to us, in the manner of the Armenians\". Setting aside the latter error (Armenian is written from left to right, like Latin script), Varthema may have meant Syriac script, implying these were most likely ethnically Central Asian or Persian Nestorian Christians, who moved to China during the Yuan dynasty, and later found their way to Indochina. However, it does not rule out that they may simply have been Chinese or Thai converts - Varthema uses the term \"white\" repeatedly to describe Southeast Asians (in contrast to South Asians).\n\nParagraph 13: Many were attracted to the Christian and Missionary Alliance, in its origin, because of the ministry of healing, and a striking parallel is noted in the founding of the Altoona Alliance Church in 1891, just four years after the founding of the national movement. A lady from Altoona, Pennsylvania, suffering from cancer, went to Pittsburgh, where she came into contact with two Christian workers of the Christian and Missionary Alliance church in that city, who prayed for her healing. After her healing she was very desirous that a full Gospel work be opened in her city, and in that same year Rev. and Mrs. Frederick H. Senft were invited to Altoona, Pa. Rev. Senft arrived in Altoona, Pa February 1891 and this was the official start of the Christian & Missionary Alliance in Altoona. After much prayer they arranged for a convention that summer in the Fifth Avenue Methodist church, securing as speakers, Dr. and Mrs. A. B. Simpson and several others. Those receiving blessing at these services desired the Alliance work continue, meeting at times to pray to that end. During the latter part of 1891 services were held in the home of the Blackwell family at 1900 10th Street. As a result, on January 23, 1892, Rev. Senft opened a Gospel Mission on 17th Street at Union and 11th Avenues. In July, 1893 the church moved to 1200 6th Avenue where a large front room served as the church meeting location, and two years later in 1894, the attendance demanded larger quarters, the pastor moved to 1428 8th Avenue, where they remained until April, 1896. In this year, Rev. Senft, acceding to the wishes of Dr. A. B. Simpson, moved to Philadelphia where an Alliance church was also established and in which city he spent the major part of his life. Under the leadership of Rev. Senft the congregation grew to more than 100 persons. Altoona, as far as can be learned, was the 2nd Alliance work in Pennsylvania. After Rev. Senft departed in 1896, Rev. B. M. Osgood became the pastor of the Altoona Alliance congregation. The church move buildings to 8th Avenue at 9th Street and continued to meet there until 1898. During this two-year period there were three pastors of the church. During the year of 1898, newly appointed Rev. Bush moved the church to 906 Green Avenue, where they held meetings on the second flood of the building. The church remained at this location until 1900.\n\nParagraph 14: With an original name of Thomastown, it was mainly built by William James Thomas, a co-owner of the Bedwas Navigation Colliery Company, (also of mines in Aberdare in the Cynon Valley). Most of the earlier parts of Trethomas were built in and around 1900 - 1913, when the mine was developing and at the apex of coal production in the South Wales coalfield. The terraced streets of Trethomas were appropriately named, some were named after members of William Thomas's family, hence the names: William, James, Thomas, and Mary. Others involved association with local areas, such as Navigation Street (associated with the Bedwas Navigation Colliery Company), Coronation Street (for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953), Redbrook Avenue after Redbrook House, which once stood on the left of the road entering the village from Machen (opposite the Chequered Flag petrol station), until its demolition in the late 1950s. It was named after the brook that ran nearby and coloured red with rust from the old drift mine that was situated at Glyn Gwyn - now redeveloped as Addison Way leading up to Graig-Y-Rhacca. The bridge over the now demolished railway line on Addison Way was built on the remains of the coal tipping from the mine.\n\nParagraph 15: During his medical and teaching career, Bowen also got into Republican Party politics, serving as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1960 to 1972.

As the three Hebrew consonants that spell Korah's name also spell the Hebrew word for \"bald\" (kereach), the Gemara deduced that he was called Korah because he caused a bald spot to be formed among the Israelites when the earth swallowed his followers. As the name Izhar () in  derived from the same Hebrew root as the word \"noon\" (, tzohorayim), the Gemara deduced from \"son of Izhar\" that Korah was a son who brought upon himself anger hot as the noon sun. As the name Kohath () in  derived from the same Hebrew root as the word for \"set on edge\" (, kihah), the Gemara deduced from \"son of Kohath\" that Korah was a son who set his ancestors' teeth on edge. The Gemara deduced from the words \"son of Levi\" in  that Korah was a son who was escorted to Gehenna. The Gemara asked why  did not say \"the son of Jacob,\" and Rabbi Samuel bar Isaac answered that Jacob had prayed not to be listed amongst Korah's ancestors in , where it is written, \"Let my soul not come into their council; unto their assembly let my glory not be united.\" \"Let my soul not come into their council\" referred to the spies, and \"unto their assembly let my glory not be united\" referred to Korah's assembly. As the name Dathan () in  derived from the same Hebrew root as the word \"law\" (, dat), the Gemara deduced from Dathan's name that he violated God's law. The Gemara related the name Abiram () in  to the Hebrew word for \"strengthened\" (iber) and deduced from Abiram's name that he stoutly refused to repent. The Gemara related the name On () in  to the Hebrew word for \"mourning\" (, aninah) and deduced from On's name that he sat in lamentations. The Gemara related the name Peleth () in  to the Hebrew word for \"miracles\" (pelaot) and deduced from Peleth's name that God performed wonders for him. And as the name Reuben () derived from the Hebrew words \"see\" (reu) and \"understand\" (, mavin), the Gemara deduced from the reference to On as a \"son of Reuben\" in that On was a son who saw and understood.\n\nParagraph 18: With an original name of Thomastown, it was mainly built by William James Thomas, a co-owner of the Bedwas Navigation Colliery Company, (also of mines in Aberdare in the Cynon Valley).

It is of two stories, supported on pillars, and a canopy with arches on each side. The lower courses of richly carved stone are of great age. Above them runs a frieze with an unintelligible pattern, and, above this, running right round the building, a fringe of elephants' heads and forequarters carved in stone. Above this is a very ranch worn frieze full of figures in bass-relief, men on horseback with bows, and animals. The elephant is a very frequent emblem. Besides the fringe frieze above mentioned, there are, on the outer wall, between every two angles, larger figures of semi-rampant elephants standing out in relief, and, in front of the entrance, stands on either side of the doorway a gigantic cement elephant. Above the shrine, a pyramid-based tower rises into a spire like a high-shouldered cone with flattened sides. The forepart of the roof consists of a number of small domes springing from a flat roof, or rather of a flat trabeate roof, with domes here and there, the largest being in the centre. Outside at all the angles of the roof are figures of animals and the gargoyles. On walls, there are some scenes from the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana.\n\nParagraph 20: After several months had passed, Casey contacted MacDonald and expressed his interest in reforming Bury Your Dead. They rounded up some of their old lineup, with a few others to fill in, and played some shows before heading down to Florida to play the annual Gainesville Fest. After acquiring vocalist Mat Bruso, they ran into their old drummer, Mark, who was touring with Between the Buried and Me, and they discussed their desire to make Bury Your Dead a serious band again. Castillo agreed, and the band did a few short tours as well as appearances at hardcore festivals including Hellfest and The New England Metal and Hardcore Festival.\n\nParagraph 21: The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage: The Official Style Guide Used by the Writers and Editors of the World's Most Authoritative Newspaper is a style guide first published in 1950 by editors at the newspaper and revised in 1974, 1999, and 2002 by Allan M. Siegal and William G. Connolly. According to the Times Deputy News Editor Philip B. Corbett (in charge of revising the manual) in 2007, the newspaper maintains an updated, intranet version of the manual that is used by NYT staff, but this online version is not available to the general public. An e-book version of this fifth edition was issued in February 2015,  and it was released in paperback form in September 2015 (Three Rivers Press, ).\n\nParagraph 22: The group eventually wakes up the next morning/afternoon. At first everything appears normal, but it soon becomes clear that Steve and his cohorts are nowhere to be found on the premises. None of the friends remembers much about what happened the previous night. And four of the friends (Jordan, Brandy, Ryan, Anna) wake up realizing they're tied up or otherwise physically incapacitated. Jordan is tied up to a chair in the bathroom next to the bathtub, with a bucket on his arm and an electric wire tied to his hand. Brandy is tied up in the bathtub. Ryan is tied to a chair in his room, and Anna is tied up on the bed, at her hands and her feet. At first the friends believe this to be some sort of bad joke, but when Todd and Claire witness Phil being intentionally decapitated by Brad, it becomes clear that Steve, Brad, Norah and Chloe are actually cruel, sadistic sociopaths, (who call themselves \"the helpers\") intent on torturing and murdering the group. Claire (Kristen Quintrall) and Todd are locked in their motel room and are forced to watch while their friends get murdered one by one. The helpers go into Anna and Ryan's room and reveal that each end of Anna's body is chained to a car, and they will drive the cars and rip her body in half. They do so, while Ryan is tied up and unable to stop them. They then go into Jordan and Brandy's room and explain that the wire attached to Jordan's arm will be lowered into the water in the bathtub by placing rocks in the bucket hanging from his arm, electrocuting Brandy. Brandy is killed from being electrocuted four times, while Jordan's arm with the wire was forcibly placed in the water. The men remove Brandy from the tub and leave Jordan with Norah. Norah taunts Jordan, who then pushes Norah into the tub and electrocutes her with the wire, killing her. Todd and Claire also manage to successfully escape from their room. However, Todd and Claire are caught while attempting to flee and are brought back to the complex. The helpers bring out Ryan (still tied to the chair) and shoot him dead in front of the others, and then chain Claire to the cars as they did to Anna, threatening to rip her body in half, unless she admits that her father was the abusive owner of an orphanage. She admits that her father was indeed the owner of an orphanage.\n\nParagraph 23: Antonio is extremely glum because Hecate's charm made him impotent on his wedding night. Francisca (Antonio's younger sister) enters. Left alone on stage, she reveals that she has been receiving secret nighttime visits from Aberzanes, and is now heavily pregnant. She worries that Antonio will kill her if the pregnancy is discovered. Isabella enters, not knowing of the pregnancy, and encourages Francisca to get married so she can discuss matters of a marital nature with her (Antonio's impotency is obviously on her mind). Antonio enters and Isabella sings a song for him; the lyrics of the song slyly allude to the plights of Isabella, Amoretta and Francisca. Aberzanes (\"a gentleman, neither honest, wise nor valiant\") enters. Francisca takes him aside and asks what they should do about her pregnancy. Aberzanes assures her that he has a plan. Sebastian enters disguised as a servant, \"Celio.\" Isabella introduces \"Celio\" (not knowing he is actually Sebastian) and says that she has just hired him that very morning. \"Celio\" announces the arrival of a letter from Antonio's mother in Northern Italy, asking Francisca to come immediately. (The letter is in fact a forgery by Aberzanes; this is his way of getting Francisca out of the house so she can give birth in secret.) Antonio orders Francisca to go to Northern Italy at once. Left alone on stage, Sebastian deduces from Antonio's glum demeanor that Hecate's charm worked. He is pleased, but even more desperate than before to get Isabella back. At the end of the scene, Gaspero enters with the Lord Governor (Isabella's uncle), who has come to pay Antonio a visit.\n\nParagraph 24: In April 1941, Captain Douglas Marr, the Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal of the Singapore Fortress Command, was accused of having committed \"an act of gross indecency\" with a male Malay youth, Sudin bin Daud, who denied being a \"catamite\". Sudin claimed that on 13 March or 14, he was walking along Stamford Road, a supposed \"area for male prostitutes\", at night when a car driven by Marr stopped, picked him up and brought him to his boarding house in Tanglin Hill. The offence against Section 377A allegedly took place there, he claimed, whereupon Marr gave Sudin some money and let Sudin take a watch before Sudin left, leaving his shirt there. In his defence, Marr claimed that he had wanted to get \"at the root of the homosexual type of vice and I thought, as it transpires very foolishly, that it would be a good idea to question a catamite and to try and find out to what extent soldiers in different regiments were involved\". Marr did not deny picking up Sudin, who he claimed approached him, but maintained that he merely questioned him back home to no avail, as he had mistaken Sudin for an Indian and spoken to him in Hindustani. On 16 April and 29 July, after a withdrawn appeal by the prosecution, Marr was acquitted of the charge, despite the fact that Sudin's shirt was found in his room. Sudin, who had pleaded guilty to the act of gross indecency and theft of the watch, was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment on 27 March.\n\nParagraph 25: Built of white sandstone and brick it is surrounded by a wall with a gateway.

The offence against Section 377A allegedly took place there, he claimed, whereupon Marr gave Sudin some money and let Sudin take a watch before Sudin left, leaving his shirt there. In his defence, Marr claimed that he had wanted to get \"at the root of the homosexual type of vice and I thought, as it transpires very foolishly, that it would be a good idea to question a catamite and to try and find out to what extent soldiers in different regiments were involved\". Marr did not deny picking up Sudin, who he claimed approached him, but maintained that he merely questioned him back home to no avail, as he had mistaken Sudin for an Indian and spoken to him in Hindustani. On 16 April and 29 July, after a withdrawn appeal by the prosecution, Marr was acquitted of the charge, despite the fact that Sudin's shirt was found in his room. Sudin, who had pleaded guilty to the act of gross indecency and theft of the watch, was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment on 27 March.\n\nParagraph 27: A variant from Karman, Persia, was collected by Emily Lorimer and David Lockhart Robertson Lorimer, with the name The Snake Prince Sleepy-Head, later translated into Italian as Il principe serpente and Mir Mast, il Principe Serpente. and into German as Der Schlangenprinz. In this tale, a king and a vizir promise to marry their children to each other. The king's wife gives birth to a black serpent named Mir Mast or Khumar (M\u012bz Mast o Khum\u0101r, or \"Prince Sleepy-Head\"), and the vizir's wife to a girl they name M\u00e8r-Nig\u0101 (\"Eye of Grace\"). They marry. One night, the vizir's daughter discovers her husband is a handsome prince and asks him how to get rid of his snakeskin. The prince tells her she must burn the shed snakeskin in a special pyre, but warns her that if she does that, she will never see him again. She decides to burn the snakeskin and he curses her to never see him again until she wears down seven pairs of iron shoes. After she accomplishes the task, Mer Niga arrives at another kingdom, where she learns from a waterbearer that the castle belongs to Mir Mast's bride-to-be. Mer Niga drops her engagement ring on the waterbearer's jar she delivers to Mir Mast and the prince notices his former wife is in the castle. They meet and he gives her some strands of his hair to help her in case she needs. Mir Mast convinces his false bride to hire Mer Niga as her maid and his aunt soon sends her on difficult tasks: she receives a pearl-encrusted sweeping broom that she must use and not drop a single pearl; to sprinkle the floor with a colander; to take a casket full of insects to \"Such and Such a place\". Still on the way, Mer Niga opens the casket and hordes of insects crawl on her. Her husband appears, collects the insects and locks them up in the box again. He then advises his wife on how to proceed: she shall give a bone to a dog and straw to a horse; open a closed door and shut an open one; compliment a hollow full of dirt and blood and drop the casket there. At last, the prince's aunt forces Mer Niga to hold candles on her fingers to illuminate her husband's bridal procession. After the wedding, Mer Niga and the Snake Prince escape from his aunt's house and take some objects with them. His aunt and uncle pursue them, but the couple throw some objects behind them (tale type ATU 313, \"The Magic Flight\"), with Miz Mast o Khum\u0101r invoking God's and the Prophet Sul\u00e9m\u0101n's help, to hinder their pursuers. German scholar  classified this tale as type AaTh 425B, Der Tierbr\u00e4utigam: Die b\u00f6se Zauberin (\"The Animal Bridegroom: The Evil Sorceress\").\n\nParagraph 28: The Telecom division leveraged the 1603 processor into the heart of its original CBX. Over time, the company began to focus on digital voice, and produced some of the earliest examples of all-digital voice equipment, including Computerized Branch Exchanges (CBXs) and digital phones. Two of the most popular telecom systems were the ROLM CBX and ROLM Redwood (PBX and Key Systems Unit (KSU) models, respectively). The CBX was meant to directly compete with Northern Telecom's SL-1, AT&T Dimension telephone systems and other computerized digital-voice systems being developed at the time. By 1980, ROLM had shot past AT&T in number of systems deployed to become the #2 PBX in North America. The Redwood, often called the \"Deadwood\" by many ROLM techs because it never caught on, was intended to compete with the Nortel Norstar Key System. When Siemens bought ROLM from IBM and introduced their \"newer\" models, which were renamed Siemens switches, the early ROLM phone switches were widely pressed into service as old technology (though a number of 8000 and 9751-9005 CBXs remain online at some companies), but the digital phone handsets were quite valuable for those expanding their phone networks. The later ROLM 9200 (actually a Siemens HCM200 Hybrid system renamed) was more competition for the leading Key Systems as the 9200 had intensive Least Call Routing software, which the Redwood did not. The company also produced one of the first commercially successful voicemail systems, PhoneMail. Digital ROLM telephones, called ROLMphones, were unique from other telephones in many ways, one of which was a lack of a physical switchhook button. Instead, the handset contains a small magnet which triggers a switch in the phone base. The opening or closing of this switch lets the phone and system know if the phone is on hook (not in use) or off-hook (in use).\n\nParagraph 29: A local peasant from a Chinese village was found murdered, hacked to death by a hand sickle. The use of a sickle, a tool used by peasants to cut the rice at harvest time, suggested that another local peasant worker had committed the murder. The local magistrate began the investigation by calling all the local peasants who could be suspects into the village square. Each was to carry their hand sickles to the town square with them. Once assembled, the magistrate ordered the ten-or-so suspects to place their hand sickles on the ground in front of them and then step back a few yards. The afternoon sun was warm and as the villagers, suspects, and magistrates waited, bright shiny metallic green flies began to buzz around them in the village square. The shiny metallic colored flies then began to focus in on one of the hand sickles lying on the ground. Within just a few minutes many had landed on the hand sickle and were crawling over it with interest. None of the other hand sickles had attracted any of these pretty flies. The owner of the tool became very nervous, and it was only a few more moments before all those in the village knew who the murderer was. With head hung in shame and pleading for mercy, the magistrate led the murderer away. The witnesses of the murder were the brightly metallic colored flies known as the blow flies which had been attracted to the remaining bits of soft tissue, blood, bone and hair which had stuck to the hand sickle after the murder was committed. The knowledge of the village magistrate as to a specific insect group's behavior regarding their attraction to dead human tissue was the key to solving this violent act and justice was served in ancient China.\n\nParagraph 30: Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez Ram\u00edrez (born 1942 in Tuxpan, Veracruz) is a Mexican businessman. He is a former CEO of Banco Nacional de M\u00e9xico (Banamex), Mexico's second largest bank, just after BBVA Bancomer, from Spain. He was a member of the board of Citigroup. Chairman of the Board, Banco Nacional de Mexico, S.A. - 1991 to present and is currently the Honorary Chairman. He cofounded with Alfredo Harp, Acciones y Valores de M\u00e9xico, S.A. DE C.V. The brokerage house that later acquired Banamex. He was: Chairman of the Board, Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A. de C.V. (Mexican Stock Exchange) - 1974 to 1979, Director - 1972 to 2003; Member of the International Advisory Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Chairman, Asociacion Mexicana de Bancos (Mexican Bankers Association) - 1993 to 1994; Member, Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A. de C.V. - 1967 to 1986; Director of Citigroup from 2001 to 2009; Other Directorships , Grupo Televisa, S.A., (until 2021)\n\nParagraph 31: In Bengal, Varthma met a pair of Chinese Christian merchants. This passage has provoked various conjectures by historians since. According to Varthema, the pair were from the \"city of Sarnau\", and that there were \"many other Christian lords\" like them there, all of them \"subjects of the Great Khan of Cathay\". The location of Sarnau is unclear. The name does not show up on contemporary maps, but appears in a few other travelogues of the time. Some (e.g. Fra Oderico) claim Sarnau is in northern China, but others (e.g. Giovanni da Empoli, Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto) suggest it is located in Indochina. The most frequent suggestion is that Sarnau is the Thai capital city of Ayutthaya. The term \"Sarnau\" may just be a transcription of the Persian term \"Shar-i Nau\", meaning \"New City\", the name by which Ayutthaya was also known at the time. There is no contradiction in their statement about Cathay: the Ayutthaya kingdom, like most other kingdoms of Indochina, had been notionally tributary to the Chinese emperor. Their identification as \"Christian\" and \"many other Christian lords\" may seem puzzling as Christianity was not known to have reached Thailand at this time. However, Nestorian Christian communities had spread in Central Asia and China with the Mongol Empire, and the persecutions after the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368 may have prompted an exodus of Nestorian Christian refugees to Indochina. Later in the travelogue, Varthema notes the ruler of Pegu (Burma) had an entire regiment of such Christians. However, Varthema claims they are \"as white as us\" and \"write in a contrary way to us, in the manner of the Armenians\". Setting aside the latter error (Armenian is written from left to right, like Latin script), Varthema may have meant Syriac script, implying these were most likely ethnically Central Asian or Persian Nestorian Christians, who moved to China during the Yuan dynasty, and later found their way to Indochina. However, it does not rule out that they may simply have been Chinese or Thai converts - Varthema uses the term \"white\" repeatedly to describe Southeast Asians (in contrast to South Asians).\n\nParagraph 32:  The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old \"standing buffalo\" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue \"charging buffalo\" logo. Later that season, the Cowboys used the \"double-star\" uniform, which could be considered an updated version of the 1960s jerseys. Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red \"standing buffalo\" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the AFL-era jerseys as opposed to the Jim Kelly/Marv Levy-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The New York Jets also received similar criticism for using their throwback logo on their then-current green helmets; when they adopted the throwback design full-time in 1998, they also went back to their original-style white helmets. The Bills and Cowboys did the same when they adopted their retro unis.\n\nParagraph 33: During his medical and teaching career, Bowen also got into Republican Party politics, serving as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1960 to 1972. He was speaker of the house from 1967 to 1972, vice chairman of the legislative council from 1967 to 1968, and chairman until 1972. After his first unsuccessful attempt in the Republican primary in 1968, he was elected Governor of Indiana in 1972 and was re-elected for a second term in 1976, making him the first Governor to serve for eight consecutive years in Indiana since 1851. His campaign slogan, featured in huge letters on billboards, was \"Otis Bowen. He Hears You\".  His tenure in Indiana's highest public office was marked by a major tax restructuring reducing reliance on property taxes, major improvements to state park facilities, development of a statewide emergency medical services system, and adoption of a medical malpractice law that was destined to become a national model. From 1978 to 1985, he also served on the board of trustees for Valparaiso University. Simultaneously, Bowen served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, the Midwestern Governors Association, and the National Governors Association. In 1980, he served as President of the Council of State Governments.\n\nParagraph 34: The story is about a Lamut (Evens) named Turgen whose family was killed by an illness which left him alone to his practice of medicine in his Yurt. He then out of his loneliness befriends a group of rams near his yurt this cause the townspeople to look at him and start strange rumors that it is impossible for a man to befriend animals so he must be a sorcerer and shunned because of it. While on coming back from his usual fishing and hunting round he hears crying and decides to help he goes inside the yurt to see 2 children. The eldest one Tim approached Turgen and with all his kindness stayed to tend to the youngest child Aska as she was only but an infant. As time past Marfa the mother of the children came from working to see Turgen tending to her children rather than being angry she was just surprised to find him in her home. As it turns out one of the people who didn't listen to the shamans words was Marfa's late husband who left marfa with some enlightening information that Turgen was a kind man that helped anyone that needed and that the shaman only spoke lies and this was proven to her as she came to see him tending to her children. From that point he frequently dropped by to see Marfa and he children bringing them meats, and salts to make sure that marfa did not need to work so hard and with that she was able to spend more time with her children. With these visits Turgen's story about his past affiliation with the rams on how he hunted them for sport and that cause great sorrow in him to see these creatures being hunter for their horns and meats even though they were minding their own business. With this gap of trust between them Turgen set out to create a wall of trust with the ram which he achieved by feeding them every day. As time passed he began to bond with the herd of ram and watched them as they at his food offering and when the rams had encounters with other dangerous creatures like bears and wolves Turgen did everything in his power to help the rams with their fight even if it meant risking his life. In the middle of September hunting season began this is where Turgen's struggle's begin as hunters start to come to the mountains and they are specifically looking for the rams to hunt. Turgen places the responsibilities of guiding the rams to a safer spot in the mountains. With the help of Marfa and her children he was able to lead the rams to safety while being watched by the hunter they threaten his life because of his actions. This is when Marfa stood up and pleaded to hunter to listen to reason and why Turgen had see the rams through. As they listen they were reminded of the shamans words and ignored er words this is when Turgen stood and talk sense to the hunter and told them how the shamans words should not be headed since he was visited by spirit for helping the rams as the Lamut were very religious they believed a spirit haunted Turgen and now believed he was free since the rams were gone. In the end Turgen was accepted back to the village and married Marfa and was able to live normal life.\n\nParagraph 35:  The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old \"standing buffalo\" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue \"charging buffalo\" logo.

Francisca (Antonio's younger sister) enters. Left alone on stage, she reveals that she has been receiving secret nighttime visits from Aberzanes, and is now heavily pregnant. She worries that Antonio will kill her if the pregnancy is discovered. Isabella enters, not knowing of the pregnancy, and encourages Francisca to get married so she can discuss matters of a marital nature with her (Antonio's impotency is obviously on her mind). Antonio enters and Isabella sings a song for him; the lyrics of the song slyly allude to the plights of Isabella, Amoretta and Francisca. Aberzanes (\"a gentleman, neither honest, wise nor valiant\") enters. Francisca takes him aside and asks what they should do about her pregnancy. Aberzanes assures her that he has a plan. Sebastian enters disguised as a servant, \"Celio.\" Isabella introduces \"Celio\" (not knowing he is actually Sebastian) and says that she has just hired him that very morning. \"Celio\" announces the arrival of a letter from Antonio's mother in Northern Italy, asking Francisca to come immediately. (The letter is in fact a forgery by Aberzanes; this is his way of getting Francisca out of the house so she can give birth in secret.) Antonio orders Francisca to go to Northern Italy at once. Left alone on stage, Sebastian deduces from Antonio's glum demeanor that Hecate's charm worked. He is pleased, but even more desperate than before to get Isabella back. At the end of the scene, Gaspero enters with the Lord Governor (Isabella's uncle), who has come to pay Antonio a visit.\n\nParagraph 37: In January 1986, while he was now working under Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation, Duggan would once again venture overseas to New Japan, now wrestling in their New Year Dash tour, coincidentally facing Inoki once again in the first day of their tour on January 3, this time ending in a double count-out. Duggan, a now more established wrestler, was receiving a lot of good results during the tour, clashing with main eventers such as Fujinami, Sakaguchi, Kimura and Choshu to draws, and dominating young lions such as Tatsutoshi Goto and Yang-Seung Hi. He also wrestled tag-team action during the series, teaming with the likes of Tony St. Clair, Johnny Mantell, Black Tiger, Mike Miller and the twin-team of Madd Maxx (1 & 2), with the majority of them ending in the losing end for Duggan's team. Duggan would tour one last time overseas in September of the same year, wrestling on New Japan's Challenge Spirit tour, resuming his encounters against Inoki, Fujinami, Kimura and Sakaguchi, as well as facing Umanosuke Ueda and George Takano in tag-team matches, teaming once again with Madd Maxx, Jerry Gray and The Angel Of Death. His last match came against Seiji Sakaguchi in a double count-out.\n\nParagraph 38: Maas was the Chiefs first-round draft pick in 1984, the fifth player taken overall.  He lived up to his first-round status, being named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year despite missing two games. After a career-high seven sacks in 1985, he matched that total the next season and was awarded his first Pro Bowl nod. He went back again to the Pro Bowl in the strike-shortened 1987 season after getting six sacks and scoring a touchdown off of a fumble recovery. Maas got off to a fast start in 1988, getting four sacks and a safety in his first seven games. He then got hurt in the eighth game and missed the rest of the season. The 1989 season was the first year in his career he did not have a sack, as it was shortened to 10 games because of injury. He did score the last touchdown of his career off of a fumble. Kansas City moved him to defensive end in 1990. He had 5.5 sacks and a safety that season. After an injury-filled 1992 season, he joined the Green Bay Packers. He spent most of the year backing up John Jurkovic at nose tackle.\n\nParagraph 39: The emerging market credit linked note, also sometimes called a \u201cclean,\u201d are traded by buy side clients to gain access to local debt markets for several reasons.  First, is that a direct investment in the sovereign debt may not be legal due to domicile restrictions of the country.  One instance would be the local government requiring the purchaser of debt to have a business office in the country, another instance would be tax restrictions or tariffs in countries with NDF currencies.  A fund in USD would have difficulty repatriating the currency if local restrictions or taxes made it undesirable.  When this occurs, the sell side global bank purchases the debt and structures it into a derivative note then issued to the client or clients.  The client then owns the issued security, which derives its total return from the underlying instrument.  A CDS, credit default swap, is embedded in the instrument.  It can be thought of as a fully funded total return swap where the underlying asset total return is exchanged for a funding fee as well as the cost of the issued CLN.  From a market risk perspective owning a CLN is almost identical to owning the local debt.  \n\nParagraph 40: A local peasant from a Chinese village was found murdered, hacked to death by a hand sickle.

He is so much in love with Debi, his wife that he readily walks out of a business meeting where the deal amounts to around Rs.7 crore when a telephone call from home informs that she is ill. She is all decked up and ready to wish him happy wedding anniversary, piano, song and all. The tell-tale white streaks in her hair show that they have been married for a while. She faints as the song ends and you\u2019ve guessed it \u2013 she is pregnant. But hubby dear is not happy. When she delivers twins, he hates to share her with them. Enter villain Charandas, an old friend of Prosanto who had the twitters for Debi but is out to avenge the stinging slap she gave him before he went to jail. He wants to set up a business. Prosanto writes out a cheque for Rs.3 crore. But Charandas\u2019 intentions are different. He kidnaps the older of the twins but to avoid being caught by the neighbourhood public, dumps the baby into the community dustbin and makes good his escape. Rahmat, the neighbourhood thief, picks up the infant, takes him home and brings him up, without keeping the story of how he found him a secret. Debi suspects that her husband of the kidnap because she finds his wrist-watch on the floor. During a heated argument, she falls off the stairs, loses her sanity and is placed in a mental home. Prosanto is jailed for 14 years and in the meanwhile, the kidnapped twin who has named himself Arjun, grows up to become the modern Robin Hood of the locality, fighting the bad ones for justice. Nandini, Charandas\u2019 beautiful daughter, falls in love with him at first sight when he steps into her marriage mandap and rescues her from marriage to a politician\u2019s villainous son. Though he does his quota of singing and dancing, he longs for the mother he thinks threw him away and feels a strange pull towards the crazy Debi when Prosanto, out of jail, asks him to help him fight Charandas for revenge. Around this time, the second twin, Akash, flies back home with a degree in psychiatric medicine under his arm. He wants to cure his mother and also falls in love with a fellow-passenger on his way back home. Some more singing and dancing follows while Arjun becomes a trusted aide of Prosanto, each one unaware of the father-son tie they are bound by. With a great deal of action scenes filled with fights, fisticuffs, breaking of ropes and so on, Charandas is defeated in his devious plans of decimating the family he hates, Debi is cured completely, Arjun and Nandini are united, blood ties are reinforced, and you just wait to hear the still photographer say \u2018smile\u2019 for the last group photograph.\n\nParagraph 42: In 1965, M\u00e9zi\u00e8res arranged a working visa through a friend of Jij\u00e9's who had a factory in Houston, Texas. In the end, however, he never took up the job in Houston. After staying in New York for a few months, the call of the West proved too strong and eventually he ended up hitchhiking across the country, first to Seattle and then to Montana (where he worked on a ranch driving tractors, laying posts and cleaning stables) before ending up in San Francisco. His initial plan was to find work in an advertising agency in San Francisco but he ran foul of the Immigration Service who told him that his visa was good for working in the factory in Houston and nowhere else. He quickly left San Francisco in search of an authentic \"Wild West\" cowboy experience. Arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah with no money, he sought out Pierre Christin, who was living there while teaching at the University of Utah, and turned up on his doorstep asking him if he could sleep on his settee. To make ends meet, M\u00e9zi\u00e8res produced some illustrations for a small advertising agency in Salt Lake City and for a Mormon children's magazine called Children's Friend as well as selling some photographs he had taken while working on the ranch in Montana. After a few months, he found work on a ranch in Utah: this time succeeding in his aspiration of living the life of a cowboy, an experience he described as \"better than in my dreams\".\n\nParagraph 43: In April 1941, Captain Douglas Marr, the Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal of the Singapore Fortress Command, was accused of having committed \"an act of gross indecency\" with a male Malay youth, Sudin bin Daud, who denied being a \"catamite\". Sudin claimed that on 13 March or 14, he was walking along Stamford Road, a supposed \"area for male prostitutes\", at night when a car driven by Marr stopped, picked him up and brought him to his boarding house in Tanglin Hill. The offence against Section 377A allegedly took place there, he claimed, whereupon Marr gave Sudin some money and let Sudin take a watch before Sudin left, leaving his shirt there. In his defence, Marr claimed that he had wanted to get \"at the root of the homosexual type of vice and I thought, as it transpires very foolishly, that it would be a good idea to question a catamite and to try and find out to what extent soldiers in different regiments were involved\". Marr did not deny picking up Sudin, who he claimed approached him, but maintained that he merely questioned him back home to no avail, as he had mistaken Sudin for an Indian and spoken to him in Hindustani. On 16 April and 29 July, after a withdrawn appeal by the prosecution, Marr was acquitted of the charge, despite the fact that Sudin's shirt was found in his room. Sudin, who had pleaded guilty to the act of gross indecency and theft of the watch, was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment on 27 March.\n\nParagraph 44: Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa heard of the South Sea from natives while sailing along the Caribbean coast. On 25 September 1513 his expedition became the first Europeans to see the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. In 1519 the town of Panam\u00e1 was founded near a small indigenous settlement on the Pacific coast. After the Spanish colonization of Peru, it developed into an important port of trade and became an administrative centre. In 1671 the Welsh privateer Henry Morgan crossed the Isthmus of Panam\u00e1 from the Caribbean side and destroyed the city. The town was relocated some kilometers to the west at a small peninsula. The ruins of the old town, Panam\u00e1 Viejo, are preserved and were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.\n\nParagraph 45: In Bengal, Varthma met a pair of Chinese Christian merchants.

The Nomads won the league championship that season and again in 1988. In 1990, the WSA merged with the east-coast based American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). The Nomads spend one season in the APSL before leaving the league. In 1989, the Cleveland Crunch of the Major Indoor Soccer League drafted Wright with the sixth pick of the expansion draft.  On March 6, 1990, the Crunch traded Wright to the San Diego Sockers. The Sockers, perennial contenders, won the MISL championship that season with Wright named as the Championship Series Unsung Hero. Wright remained in San Diego until the MISL collapsed in 1992. On January 7, 1993, Wright signed with the Milwaukee Wave of the National Professional Soccer League (NSPL). Although the Wave failed to make the playoffs, Wright's forty-five goals in twenty-five games led to his selection as a first team All Star. That summer Wright signed with the Los Angeles Salsa of the outdoor American Professional Soccer League. In October, 1993, the Salsa loaned Wright to the Baltimore Blast of the NPSL. Wright was back the Salsa for the summer 1994 season, but after the Salsa folded that fall, he signed with the Wichita Wings of the NPSL for the 1994\u20131995 season. Wright would not return to the NPSL until 1999. In 1993, Wright signed with the Los Angeles Salsa of the outdoor American Professional Soccer League. He had not played outdoor soccer since playing with the Nomads in 1990, but this did not stop Wright from finishing second in points and goals to team mate Paulinho Crici\u00fama, being named a first team All Star.  In 1994, Wright led the league in scoring, tying Paulhino for the points lead. He was again selected as a first team All Star.  After playing with the Baltimore Blast during the 1994\u20131995 winter indoor season, Wright did not return to the APSL, but instead signed with the Sacramento Knights of the Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL). The CISL played a summer indoor schedule. In December 1995, Major League Soccer announced it had signed Wright to a league contract. In preparation for its first season, MLS signed players to contracts, then distributed these players through the league via an initial allocation and an inaugural player draft. In February 1996, the Kansas City Wizards selected Wright in the third round (twenty-fifth overall) of the 1996 MLS Supplemental Draft. He spent four seasons in Kansas City. When the Wizards released him in 1999, Wright signed with the Western Mass Pioneers where he played four outdoor seasons. In the fall of 1999, he returned to the Baltimore Blast in the NPSL. He spent most of three seasons in Baltimore, but saw time in seven games with the Philadelphia KiXX during the 2000\u20132001 season. In February 2002, the Blast waived Wright, who was leading the team in scoring at the time. The San Diego Sockers quickly signed Wright in preparation for the team's move to the new Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). In October 2002, he signed another year-long contract and remained with the Sockers until it discontinued operations in December 2005. On January 5, 2005, the Chicago Storm selected Wright in the MISL Dispersal Draft. Wright both owns an athletic training company, Speed to Burn. In April 2006, he joined the San Diego Fusion of the amateur fourth division National Premier Soccer League. In 2009, he signed with the San Diego Sockers of the Professional Arena Soccer League. In May 2011, it was announced he signed with a new team in the PASL, the Anaheim Bolts. In October 2012, he re-signed with the San Diego Sockers for the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nParagraph 47: In August 1373, John of Gaunt, accompanied by John de Montfort, Duke of Brittany led a force of 9,000 men out from Calais on a major chevauch\u00e9e.  While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English began to meet further resistance as they moved south.  French forces began to concentrate around the English force but, under specific orders from King Charles V, the French avoided a set battle.  Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves being trapped against the River Allier by four separate French forces.  With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at Moulins but lost all their baggage and loot.  The English carried on south across the Limousin plateau but the weather turned severe.  Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour.  At the beginning of December, the army finally entered friendly territory in Gascony.  By the end of December they were in Bordeaux, starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais.  Although the march across France had been a remarkable feat, it was a military failure.\n\nParagraph 48: A technicality resulted in Archer's being denied a third try at the Melbourne Cup. His telegraphed acceptance to race failed to arrive in time (delivery was delayed due to a public holiday in Melbourne), and Archer was refused permission to enter the race. Nominations for the 1863 Melbourne Cup had to be lodged with the Victorian Turf Club by Wednesday, 29 April, accompanied by five gold sovereigns. De Mestre had nominated two of his horses, Archer and Haidee. Weights were declared and published in Bell's Life in Sydney on Saturday, 9 May. Archer was to carry 11\u00a0st 4\u00a0lb (71.82\u00a0kg, or 158\u00a0lb) - which, if he had raced, would have been the heaviest handicap in the history of the Melbourne Cup. Under the care of groom and trainer Tom Lamond Archer and Haidee steamed to Melbourne, leaving Sydney on the City Of Melbourne Tuesday, 16 June. Acceptance, with an additional five-sovereign payment, had to be lodged with the VTC by 8pm Wednesday, 1 July; de Mestre (still in Sydney) had overlooked the deadline. Reminded on the morning of 1 July  by Sam Jenner of George Kirk & Co. of the deadline, de Mestre requested a telegram be sent to the Melbourne office of George Kirk & Co. asking them to accept on his behalf. De Mestre took the telegram to the telegraph office himself, and it was received in the Melbourne Telegraph Office at 1 pm. Wednesday, 1 July was a public holiday in Melbourne, and the telegram was not delivered to the George Kirk & Co. offices until 7:30 pm. The next morning George Kirk handed the telegram to the stewards at the Turf Club, who decided it was too late. This decision caused controversy amongst Archer's Sydney supporters, who had expected him to win. Pressure by Victorian owners made no difference to the VTC, which stood its ground. To protest this decision and show solidarity, the interstate entrants boycotted the third Cup. Unknown at the time, however, was that due to injury Archer would have been unlikely to race. The third Melbourne Cup ran with only seven Victoria horses, the smallest number in its history.", "answers": ["45"], "pred": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,", "length": 13970, "dataset": "passage_count", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "96ba7321f31f1e7791d8b8b233be77a34dcb873be323c9a0"}

She has also taken a lead in combatting violence against young girls with immigrant backgrounds:  issues on which she has campaigned include excision, forced expatriation and various classes of \"honour crime\".   A particularly high-profile cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre into which she launched herself became identified by slogan-headline \"M\u00e8res d\u2019Alger\" (loosely, \"Mothers of Algiers\"):   A shared colonial history had left several hundred thousand Algerians in France, many of whom came from families that had ended the Algerian War on the \"wrong\" side.   During the 1980s a succession of cases came to the fore in which, following marital ructions, fathers with Algerian connections had removed their children to Algeria, in defiance of French court rulings granting custody of the children in question to their mothers remaining in France.   In an effort to provide a remedy for these cases, in August 1986 the governments of France and Algeria signed a convention, but a view quickly emerged that this had failed to provide an effective remedy.   Under Sugier's leadership, the LDIF played a major role in highlighting the issues.   A particular atrocity in point was the \"Sohane affair\", which came up in 2002.   The LDIF received an appeal from the murdered girl's father and sisters that it should join itself as a civil party to the ensuing legal case against the murder suspect and his accomplice, in order \"to support the struggle for the memory of Sohane and to ensure that the same thing should not happen in the future to any other person\".   The trial evidently took some time to prepare, but when it was held, between 31 March and 7 April 2007, the killer and his accomplice were both found guilty.   The killer received a 25-year jail sentence while the accomplice was sentenced to 8 years.   The accomplice now made the tactical error of lodging an appeal.   The LDIF legal team seized the opportunity and lodged their own appeal.   The LDIF was represented at the trial by Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer with a reputation in the field of women's rights:   Sugier and Weil-Curiel had made their important first visit to the dead girl's sister and father together.   Throughout the trial Weil-Cureil had emphasized the sexist aspect of the case, and the advocate general clearly took full cognisance of her submissions.   The LDIF was represented not in respect of the criminal aspects of the matter but as a civil litigant:  on 18 September 2006 the court responsible for the civil aspect of the case accepted that the LDIF intervention was \"admissible and well founded\".   The appeal in respect of the accomplice was heard at the Seine-Saint-Denis Court of Assizes between 8 June and 14 June 2007; a ten-year jail term was substituted for the earlier, lesser sentence.   After the verdict, Annie Sugier produced a rapid succession of statements and articles celebrating the fact that for the first time, under pressure from the LIDF's involvement in the case, a court in France had been persuaded to respond to the acts of torture and barbarism of which Sohane Benziane was the victim, to acknowledge the concept of \"a sexist crime\".\n\nParagraph 2: The following spring, an unnamed journalist reveals the uselessness of Phalanx and the truth of Solanum, sparking a crisis later dubbed the \"Great Panic\" in which global order collapses, with rioting, breakdown of essential services, and indiscriminate culling of citizens killing more people than the zombies themselves. Russia forces a decimation of its military to end rampant mutinies. Ukraine uses VX gas on refugees and its own citizens in an attempt to weed out the infected. Iran and Pakistan destroy each other in a brief nuclear exchange over a refugee crisis. When the US military stages a high-profile battle in Yonkers, New York, their conventional warfare tactics prove insufficient against the overwhelming horde of zombies, and the military is routed on live television. The catastrophe causes the US President to suffer a nervous breakdown, resulting in the Vice President and his cabinet invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment and forcibly removing him from office. The US government evacuates west of the Rocky Mountains and establishes a new capital in Honolulu, Hawaii. The ISS remains crewed by three astronauts who volunteer to not return to Earth; its commander observes miles-wide \"mega swarms\" of zombies stretching across Central Asia and the Great Plains. The fallout from the Iran\u2013Pakistan War, as well as the millions of global fires sparked by the crisis, creates a nuclear winter. Knowing that zombies freeze solid in extreme cold, many ill-prepared North American civilians flee into the wilderness of northern Canada, where an estimated eleven million people die of disease, hypothermia, starvation, and cannibalism. Paul Redeker, a former intelligence consultant for the apartheid-era South African government, develops a drastic survival strategy that designates large groups of humans as unwitting bait, distracting the undead to give safe zones time to fortify themselves and build up resources; most countries go on to adopt the controversial plan.\n\nParagraph 3: In order to attract audiences who would donate to stations, which, in turn, purchased programming from other stations and producers in the PBS system, program managers felt increasingly that it was necessary to reduce the proportion of cultural and informational shows on the adult schedule, in order to appeal to a wider audience than a small, highly educated cohort. This especially became the case during pledge drives, which were imagined to be times when non-regular viewers could be appealed to with special programming. With the aging (and eventual death) of audiences who were the most enthusiastic for more serious (and heretofore customary) fare, it was felt that younger viewers with more disposable income would be more interested in programs akin to those they were accustomed to on commercial television rather than formats such as classical dramas (a number of them imports from the British Broadcasting Corporation) and documentaries on sometimes arcane subjects. This led to the introduction of things like lifestyle-oriented shows featuring hobbies like gardening, cooking, and home repair; specialty or niche informational programs like the Nightly Business Report and The Charlie Rose Show; reruns of certain former commercial TV shows (e.g., The Lawrence Welk Show, National Geographic specials); and British-import situation comedies (a la Are You Being Served?, Monty Python's Flying Circus). This amounted to exchanging what is termed as \"high-brow\" material for a more \"middle-brow\" approach to programming, while avoiding conspicuously mass-appeal formats such as adult-oriented game shows, action-oriented crime dramas, sensationalistic news magazines, and celebrity-driven talk shows. By the 1990s and 2000s, pledge drives became mainly reliant on fare such as TJ Lubinsky's nostalgic music specials (which themselves focus on oldies and adult standards music largely abandoned by commercial outlets) and self-help seminars of often questionable integrity (the latter were in fact not officially sanctioned by PBS and even rebuked by the network's ombudsman). Despite the stated aims to appeal to a non-elderly audience, PBS could not keep up, it seemed to many, with rapid developments in cable television, which began offering alternatives to viewers that were generally more sensationalistic and visually compelling than the staid, restrained traditions of the public medium. Some of those new networks in fact began aping the \"how-to\" and lifestyle formats that originally became popular via PBS (e.g., HGTV, Food Network). That competition, in turn, began to influence programmers to even further diminish or outright remove any shows considered \"stuffy\" or slow-paced, which eliminated several long-running staples of the network (e.g., Firing Line [original version], Wall Street Week).\n\nParagraph 4: The following spring, an unnamed journalist reveals the uselessness of Phalanx and the truth of Solanum, sparking a crisis later dubbed the \"Great Panic\" in which global order collapses, with rioting, breakdown of essential services, and indiscriminate culling of citizens killing more people than the zombies themselves.

She has also taken a lead in combatting violence against young girls with immigrant backgrounds:  issues on which she has campaigned include excision, forced expatriation and various classes of \"honour crime\".   A particularly high-profile cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre into which she launched herself became identified by slogan-headline \"M\u00e8res d\u2019Alger\" (loosely, \"Mothers of Algiers\"):   A shared colonial history had left several hundred thousand Algerians in France, many of whom came from families that had ended the Algerian War on the \"wrong\" side.   During the 1980s a succession of cases came to the fore in which, following marital ructions, fathers with Algerian connections had removed their children to Algeria, in defiance of French court rulings granting custody of the children in question to their mothers remaining in France.   In an effort to provide a remedy for these cases, in August 1986 the governments of France and Algeria signed a convention, but a view quickly emerged that this had failed to provide an effective remedy.   Under Sugier's leadership, the LDIF played a major role in highlighting the issues.   A particular atrocity in point was the \"Sohane affair\", which came up in 2002.   The LDIF received an appeal from the murdered girl's father and sisters that it should join itself as a civil party to the ensuing legal case against the murder suspect and his accomplice, in order \"to support the struggle for the memory of Sohane and to ensure that the same thing should not happen in the future to any other person\".   The trial evidently took some time to prepare, but when it was held, between 31 March and 7 April 2007, the killer and his accomplice were both found guilty.   The killer received a 25-year jail sentence while the accomplice was sentenced to 8 years.   The accomplice now made the tactical error of lodging an appeal.   The LDIF legal team seized the opportunity and lodged their own appeal.   The LDIF was represented at the trial by Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer with a reputation in the field of women's rights:   Sugier and Weil-Curiel had made their important first visit to the dead girl's sister and father together.   Throughout the trial Weil-Cureil had emphasized the sexist aspect of the case, and the advocate general clearly took full cognisance of her submissions.   The LDIF was represented not in respect of the criminal aspects of the matter but as a civil litigant:  on 18 September 2006 the court responsible for the civil aspect of the case accepted that the LDIF intervention was \"admissible and well founded\".   The appeal in respect of the accomplice was heard at the Seine-Saint-Denis Court of Assizes between 8 June and 14 June 2007; a ten-year jail term was substituted for the earlier, lesser sentence.   After the verdict, Annie Sugier produced a rapid succession of statements and articles celebrating the fact that for the first time, under pressure from the LIDF's involvement in the case, a court in France had been persuaded to respond to the acts of torture and barbarism of which Sohane Benziane was the victim, to acknowledge the concept of \"a sexist crime\".\n\nParagraph 19: He began his professional career as a songwriter for Shalimar Music in 1957.

This especially became the case during pledge drives, which were imagined to be times when non-regular viewers could be appealed to with special programming. With the aging (and eventual death) of audiences who were the most enthusiastic for more serious (and heretofore customary) fare, it was felt that younger viewers with more disposable income would be more interested in programs akin to those they were accustomed to on commercial television rather than formats such as classical dramas (a number of them imports from the British Broadcasting Corporation) and documentaries on sometimes arcane subjects. This led to the introduction of things like lifestyle-oriented shows featuring hobbies like gardening, cooking, and home repair; specialty or niche informational programs like the Nightly Business Report and The Charlie Rose Show; reruns of certain former commercial TV shows (e.g., The Lawrence Welk Show, National Geographic specials); and British-import situation comedies (a la Are You Being Served?, Monty Python's Flying Circus). This amounted to exchanging what is termed as \"high-brow\" material for a more \"middle-brow\" approach to programming, while avoiding conspicuously mass-appeal formats such as adult-oriented game shows, action-oriented crime dramas, sensationalistic news magazines, and celebrity-driven talk shows. By the 1990s and 2000s, pledge drives became mainly reliant on fare such as TJ Lubinsky's nostalgic music specials (which themselves focus on oldies and adult standards music largely abandoned by commercial outlets) and self-help seminars of often questionable integrity (the latter were in fact not officially sanctioned by PBS and even rebuked by the network's ombudsman). Despite the stated aims to appeal to a non-elderly audience, PBS could not keep up, it seemed to many, with rapid developments in cable television, which began offering alternatives to viewers that were generally more sensationalistic and visually compelling than the staid, restrained traditions of the public medium. Some of those new networks in fact began aping the \"how-to\" and lifestyle formats that originally became popular via PBS (e.g., HGTV, Food Network). That competition, in turn, began to influence programmers to even further diminish or outright remove any shows considered \"stuffy\" or slow-paced, which eliminated several long-running staples of the network (e.g., Firing Line [original version], Wall Street Week).\n\nParagraph 21: He began his professional career as a songwriter for Shalimar Music in 1957.

This especially became the case during pledge drives, which were imagined to be times when non-regular viewers could be appealed to with special programming. With the aging (and eventual death) of audiences who were the most enthusiastic for more serious (and heretofore customary) fare, it was felt that younger viewers with more disposable income would be more interested in programs akin to those they were accustomed to on commercial television rather than formats such as classical dramas (a number of them imports from the British Broadcasting Corporation) and documentaries on sometimes arcane subjects. This led to the introduction of things like lifestyle-oriented shows featuring hobbies like gardening, cooking, and home repair; specialty or niche informational programs like the Nightly Business Report and The Charlie Rose Show; reruns of certain former commercial TV shows (e.g., The Lawrence Welk Show, National Geographic specials); and British-import situation comedies (a la Are You Being Served?, Monty Python's Flying Circus). This amounted to exchanging what is termed as \"high-brow\" material for a more \"middle-brow\" approach to programming, while avoiding conspicuously mass-appeal formats such as adult-oriented game shows, action-oriented crime dramas, sensationalistic news magazines, and celebrity-driven talk shows. By the 1990s and 2000s, pledge drives became mainly reliant on fare such as TJ Lubinsky's nostalgic music specials (which themselves focus on oldies and adult standards music largely abandoned by commercial outlets) and self-help seminars of often questionable integrity (the latter were in fact not officially sanctioned by PBS and even rebuked by the network's ombudsman). Despite the stated aims to appeal to a non-elderly audience, PBS could not keep up, it seemed to many, with rapid developments in cable television, which began offering alternatives to viewers that were generally more sensationalistic and visually compelling than the staid, restrained traditions of the public medium. Some of those new networks in fact began aping the \"how-to\" and lifestyle formats that originally became popular via PBS (e.g., HGTV, Food Network). That competition, in turn, began to influence programmers to even further diminish or outright remove any shows considered \"stuffy\" or slow-paced, which eliminated several long-running staples of the network (e.g., Firing Line [original version], Wall Street Week).\n\nParagraph 34: In order to attract audiences who would donate to stations, which, in turn, purchased programming from other stations and producers in the PBS system, program managers felt increasingly that it was necessary to reduce the proportion of cultural and informational shows on the adult schedule, in order to appeal to a wider audience than a small, highly educated cohort.

She has also taken a lead in combatting violence against young girls with immigrant backgrounds:  issues on which she has campaigned include excision, forced expatriation and various classes of \"honour crime\".   A particularly high-profile cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre into which she launched herself became identified by slogan-headline \"M\u00e8res d\u2019Alger\" (loosely, \"Mothers of Algiers\"):   A shared colonial history had left several hundred thousand Algerians in France, many of whom came from families that had ended the Algerian War on the \"wrong\" side.   During the 1980s a succession of cases came to the fore in which, following marital ructions, fathers with Algerian connections had removed their children to Algeria, in defiance of French court rulings granting custody of the children in question to their mothers remaining in France.   In an effort to provide a remedy for these cases, in August 1986 the governments of France and Algeria signed a convention, but a view quickly emerged that this had failed to provide an effective remedy.   Under Sugier's leadership, the LDIF played a major role in highlighting the issues.   A particular atrocity in point was the \"Sohane affair\", which came up in 2002.   The LDIF received an appeal from the murdered girl's father and sisters that it should join itself as a civil party to the ensuing legal case against the murder suspect and his accomplice, in order \"to support the struggle for the memory of Sohane and to ensure that the same thing should not happen in the future to any other person\".   The trial evidently took some time to prepare, but when it was held, between 31 March and 7 April 2007, the killer and his accomplice were both found guilty.   The killer received a 25-year jail sentence while the accomplice was sentenced to 8 years.   The accomplice now made the tactical error of lodging an appeal.   The LDIF legal team seized the opportunity and lodged their own appeal.   The LDIF was represented at the trial by Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer with a reputation in the field of women's rights:   Sugier and Weil-Curiel had made their important first visit to the dead girl's sister and father together.   Throughout the trial Weil-Cureil had emphasized the sexist aspect of the case, and the advocate general clearly took full cognisance of her submissions.   The LDIF was represented not in respect of the criminal aspects of the matter but as a civil litigant:  on 18 September 2006 the court responsible for the civil aspect of the case accepted that the LDIF intervention was \"admissible and well founded\".   The appeal in respect of the accomplice was heard at the Seine-Saint-Denis Court of Assizes between 8 June and 14 June 2007; a ten-year jail term was substituted for the earlier, lesser sentence.   After the verdict, Annie Sugier produced a rapid succession of statements and articles celebrating the fact that for the first time, under pressure from the LIDF's involvement in the case, a court in France had been persuaded to respond to the acts of torture and barbarism of which Sohane Benziane was the victim, to acknowledge the concept of \"a sexist crime\".\n\nParagraph 36: He began his professional career as a songwriter for Shalimar Music in 1957.

A particularly high-profile cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre into which she launched herself became identified by slogan-headline \"M\u00e8res d\u2019Alger\" (loosely, \"Mothers of Algiers\"):   A shared colonial history had left several hundred thousand Algerians in France, many of whom came from families that had ended the Algerian War on the \"wrong\" side.   During the 1980s a succession of cases came to the fore in which, following marital ructions, fathers with Algerian connections had removed their children to Algeria, in defiance of French court rulings granting custody of the children in question to their mothers remaining in France.   In an effort to provide a remedy for these cases, in August 1986 the governments of France and Algeria signed a convention, but a view quickly emerged that this had failed to provide an effective remedy.   Under Sugier's leadership, the LDIF played a major role in highlighting the issues.   A particular atrocity in point was the \"Sohane affair\", which came up in 2002.   The LDIF received an appeal from the murdered girl's father and sisters that it should join itself as a civil party to the ensuing legal case against the murder suspect and his accomplice, in order \"to support the struggle for the memory of Sohane and to ensure that the same thing should not happen in the future to any other person\".   The trial evidently took some time to prepare, but when it was held, between 31 March and 7 April 2007, the killer and his accomplice were both found guilty.   The killer received a 25-year jail sentence while the accomplice was sentenced to 8 years.   The accomplice now made the tactical error of lodging an appeal.   The LDIF legal team seized the opportunity and lodged their own appeal.   The LDIF was represented at the trial by Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer with a reputation in the field of women's rights:   Sugier and Weil-Curiel had made their important first visit to the dead girl's sister and father together.   Throughout the trial Weil-Cureil had emphasized the sexist aspect of the case, and the advocate general clearly took full cognisance of her submissions.   The LDIF was represented not in respect of the criminal aspects of the matter but as a civil litigant:  on 18 September 2006 the court responsible for the civil aspect of the case accepted that the LDIF intervention was \"admissible and well founded\".   The appeal in respect of the accomplice was heard at the Seine-Saint-Denis Court of Assizes between 8 June and 14 June 2007; a ten-year jail term was substituted for the earlier, lesser sentence.   After the verdict, Annie Sugier produced a rapid succession of statements and articles celebrating the fact that for the first time, under pressure from the LIDF's involvement in the case, a court in France had been persuaded to respond to the acts of torture and barbarism of which Sohane Benziane was the victim, to acknowledge the concept of \"a sexist crime\".\n\nParagraph 6: In order to attract audiences who would donate to stations, which, in turn, purchased programming from other stations and producers in the PBS system, program managers felt increasingly that it was necessary to reduce the proportion of cultural and informational shows on the adult schedule, in order to appeal to a wider audience than a small, highly educated cohort. This especially became the case during pledge drives, which were imagined to be times when non-regular viewers could be appealed to with special programming. With the aging (and eventual death) of audiences who were the most enthusiastic for more serious (and heretofore customary) fare, it was felt that younger viewers with more disposable income would be more interested in programs akin to those they were accustomed to on commercial television rather than formats such as classical dramas (a number of them imports from the British Broadcasting Corporation) and documentaries on sometimes arcane subjects. This led to the introduction of things like lifestyle-oriented shows featuring hobbies like gardening, cooking, and home repair; specialty or niche informational programs like the Nightly Business Report and The Charlie Rose Show; reruns of certain former commercial TV shows (e.g., The Lawrence Welk Show, National Geographic specials); and British-import situation comedies (a la Are You Being Served?, Monty Python's Flying Circus). This amounted to exchanging what is termed as \"high-brow\" material for a more \"middle-brow\" approach to programming, while avoiding conspicuously mass-appeal formats such as adult-oriented game shows, action-oriented crime dramas, sensationalistic news magazines, and celebrity-driven talk shows. By the 1990s and 2000s, pledge drives became mainly reliant on fare such as TJ Lubinsky's nostalgic music specials (which themselves focus on oldies and adult standards music largely abandoned by commercial outlets) and self-help seminars of often questionable integrity (the latter were in fact not officially sanctioned by PBS and even rebuked by the network's ombudsman). Despite the stated aims to appeal to a non-elderly audience, PBS could not keep up, it seemed to many, with rapid developments in cable television, which began offering alternatives to viewers that were generally more sensationalistic and visually compelling than the staid, restrained traditions of the public medium. Some of those new networks in fact began aping the \"how-to\" and lifestyle formats that originally became popular via PBS (e.g., HGTV, Food Network). That competition, in turn, began to influence programmers to even further diminish or outright remove any shows considered \"stuffy\" or slow-paced, which eliminated several long-running staples of the network (e.g., Firing Line [original version], Wall Street Week).\n\nParagraph 7: The following spring, an unnamed journalist reveals the uselessness of Phalanx and the truth of Solanum, sparking a crisis later dubbed the \"Great Panic\" in which global order collapses, with rioting, breakdown of essential services, and indiscriminate culling of citizens killing more people than the zombies themselves. Russia forces a decimation of its military to end rampant mutinies. Ukraine uses VX gas on refugees and its own citizens in an attempt to weed out the infected. Iran and Pakistan destroy each other in a brief nuclear exchange over a refugee crisis. When the US military stages a high-profile battle in Yonkers, New York, their conventional warfare tactics prove insufficient against the overwhelming horde of zombies, and the military is routed on live television. The catastrophe causes the US President to suffer a nervous breakdown, resulting in the Vice President and his cabinet invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment and forcibly removing him from office. The US government evacuates west of the Rocky Mountains and establishes a new capital in Honolulu, Hawaii. The ISS remains crewed by three astronauts who volunteer to not return to Earth; its commander observes miles-wide \"mega swarms\" of zombies stretching across Central Asia and the Great Plains. The fallout from the Iran\u2013Pakistan War, as well as the millions of global fires sparked by the crisis, creates a nuclear winter. Knowing that zombies freeze solid in extreme cold, many ill-prepared North American civilians flee into the wilderness of northern Canada, where an estimated eleven million people die of disease, hypothermia, starvation, and cannibalism.

A particularly high-profile cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre into which she launched herself became identified by slogan-headline \"M\u00e8res d\u2019Alger\" (loosely, \"Mothers of Algiers\"):   A shared colonial history had left several hundred thousand Algerians in France, many of whom came from families that had ended the Algerian War on the \"wrong\" side.   During the 1980s a succession of cases came to the fore in which, following marital ructions, fathers with Algerian connections had removed their children to Algeria, in defiance of French court rulings granting custody of the children in question to their mothers remaining in France.   In an effort to provide a remedy for these cases, in August 1986 the governments of France and Algeria signed a convention, but a view quickly emerged that this had failed to provide an effective remedy.   Under Sugier's leadership, the LDIF played a major role in highlighting the issues.   A particular atrocity in point was the \"Sohane affair\", which came up in 2002.   The LDIF received an appeal from the murdered girl's father and sisters that it should join itself as a civil party to the ensuing legal case against the murder suspect and his accomplice, in order \"to support the struggle for the memory of Sohane and to ensure that the same thing should not happen in the future to any other person\".   The trial evidently took some time to prepare, but when it was held, between 31 March and 7 April 2007, the killer and his accomplice were both found guilty.   The killer received a 25-year jail sentence while the accomplice was sentenced to 8 years.   The accomplice now made the tactical error of lodging an appeal.   The LDIF legal team seized the opportunity and lodged their own appeal.   The LDIF was represented at the trial by Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer with a reputation in the field of women's rights:   Sugier and Weil-Curiel had made their important first visit to the dead girl's sister and father together.   Throughout the trial Weil-Cureil had emphasized the sexist aspect of the case, and the advocate general clearly took full cognisance of her submissions.   The LDIF was represented not in respect of the criminal aspects of the matter but as a civil litigant:  on 18 September 2006 the court responsible for the civil aspect of the case accepted that the LDIF intervention was \"admissible and well founded\".   The appeal in respect of the accomplice was heard at the Seine-Saint-Denis Court of Assizes between 8 June and 14 June 2007; a ten-year jail term was substituted for the earlier, lesser sentence.   After the verdict, Annie Sugier produced a rapid succession of statements and articles celebrating the fact that for the first time, under pressure from the LIDF's involvement in the case, a court in France had been persuaded to respond to the acts of torture and barbarism of which Sohane Benziane was the victim, to acknowledge the concept of \"a sexist crime\".\n\nParagraph 23: The longstanding president of the  \"International Women's Rights League\" (\"Ligue du droit international des femmes\" / LDIF), she has tackled on the international level the fashion for invoking of \"cultural relativism\" as a justification for opposing the universal application of women's rights.

This especially became the case during pledge drives, which were imagined to be times when non-regular viewers could be appealed to with special programming. With the aging (and eventual death) of audiences who were the most enthusiastic for more serious (and heretofore customary) fare, it was felt that younger viewers with more disposable income would be more interested in programs akin to those they were accustomed to on commercial television rather than formats such as classical dramas (a number of them imports from the British Broadcasting Corporation) and documentaries on sometimes arcane subjects. This led to the introduction of things like lifestyle-oriented shows featuring hobbies like gardening, cooking, and home repair; specialty or niche informational programs like the Nightly Business Report and The Charlie Rose Show; reruns of certain former commercial TV shows (e.g., The Lawrence Welk Show, National Geographic specials); and British-import situation comedies (a la Are You Being Served?, Monty Python's Flying Circus). This amounted to exchanging what is termed as \"high-brow\" material for a more \"middle-brow\" approach to programming, while avoiding conspicuously mass-appeal formats such as adult-oriented game shows, action-oriented crime dramas, sensationalistic news magazines, and celebrity-driven talk shows. By the 1990s and 2000s, pledge drives became mainly reliant on fare such as TJ Lubinsky's nostalgic music specials (which themselves focus on oldies and adult standards music largely abandoned by commercial outlets) and self-help seminars of often questionable integrity (the latter were in fact not officially sanctioned by PBS and even rebuked by the network's ombudsman). Despite the stated aims to appeal to a non-elderly audience, PBS could not keep up, it seemed to many, with rapid developments in cable television, which began offering alternatives to viewers that were generally more sensationalistic and visually compelling than the staid, restrained traditions of the public medium. Some of those new networks in fact began aping the \"how-to\" and lifestyle formats that originally became popular via PBS (e.g., HGTV, Food Network). That competition, in turn, began to influence programmers to even further diminish or outright remove any shows considered \"stuffy\" or slow-paced, which eliminated several long-running staples of the network (e.g., Firing Line [original version], Wall Street Week).\n\nParagraph 25: The following spring, an unnamed journalist reveals the uselessness of Phalanx and the truth of Solanum, sparking a crisis later dubbed the \"Great Panic\" in which global order collapses, with rioting, breakdown of essential services, and indiscriminate culling of citizens killing more people than the zombies themselves. Russia forces a decimation of its military to end rampant mutinies. Ukraine uses VX gas on refugees and its own citizens in an attempt to weed out the infected. Iran and Pakistan destroy each other in a brief nuclear exchange over a refugee crisis. When the US military stages a high-profile battle in Yonkers, New York, their conventional warfare tactics prove insufficient against the overwhelming horde of zombies, and the military is routed on live television. The catastrophe causes the US President to suffer a nervous breakdown, resulting in the Vice President and his cabinet invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment and forcibly removing him from office. The US government evacuates west of the Rocky Mountains and establishes a new capital in Honolulu, Hawaii.

She has also taken a lead in combatting violence against young girls with immigrant backgrounds:  issues on which she has campaigned include excision, forced expatriation and various classes of \"honour crime\".   A particularly high-profile cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre into which she launched herself became identified by slogan-headline \"M\u00e8res d\u2019Alger\" (loosely, \"Mothers of Algiers\"):   A shared colonial history had left several hundred thousand Algerians in France, many of whom came from families that had ended the Algerian War on the \"wrong\" side.   During the 1980s a succession of cases came to the fore in which, following marital ructions, fathers with Algerian connections had removed their children to Algeria, in defiance of French court rulings granting custody of the children in question to their mothers remaining in France.   In an effort to provide a remedy for these cases, in August 1986 the governments of France and Algeria signed a convention, but a view quickly emerged that this had failed to provide an effective remedy.   Under Sugier's leadership, the LDIF played a major role in highlighting the issues.   A particular atrocity in point was the \"Sohane affair\", which came up in 2002.   The LDIF received an appeal from the murdered girl's father and sisters that it should join itself as a civil party to the ensuing legal case against the murder suspect and his accomplice, in order \"to support the struggle for the memory of Sohane and to ensure that the same thing should not happen in the future to any other person\".   The trial evidently took some time to prepare, but when it was held, between 31 March and 7 April 2007, the killer and his accomplice were both found guilty.   The killer received a 25-year jail sentence while the accomplice was sentenced to 8 years.   The accomplice now made the tactical error of lodging an appeal.   The LDIF legal team seized the opportunity and lodged their own appeal.   The LDIF was represented at the trial by Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer with a reputation in the field of women's rights:   Sugier and Weil-Curiel had made their important first visit to the dead girl's sister and father together.   Throughout the trial Weil-Cureil had emphasized the sexist aspect of the case, and the advocate general clearly took full cognisance of her submissions.   The LDIF was represented not in respect of the criminal aspects of the matter but as a civil litigant:  on 18 September 2006 the court responsible for the civil aspect of the case accepted that the LDIF intervention was \"admissible and well founded\".   The appeal in respect of the accomplice was heard at the Seine-Saint-Denis Court of Assizes between 8 June and 14 June 2007; a ten-year jail term was substituted for the earlier, lesser sentence.   After the verdict, Annie Sugier produced a rapid succession of statements and articles celebrating the fact that for the first time, under pressure from the LIDF's involvement in the case, a court in France had been persuaded to respond to the acts of torture and barbarism of which Sohane Benziane was the victim, to acknowledge the concept of \"a sexist crime\".\n\nParagraph 40: The longstanding president of the  \"International Women's Rights League\" (\"Ligue du droit international des femmes\" / LDIF), she has tackled on the international level the fashion for invoking of \"cultural relativism\" as a justification for opposing the universal application of women's rights.

The games that were scheduled for the third week of the season were cancelled, reducing the 16-game season to 15, but the games for Weeks 4, 5 and 6 were played with replacement players. The NFLPA actually ended the strike before the Week 6 slate of games, but the NFL owners' unanimously nixed their return that week because the union had missed an owner-mandated deadline that week to be eligible to return, and would have to wait until Week 7 to resume playing. Approximately 15% of the NFLPA\u2019s players chose to cross picket lines to play during the strike; prominent players who did so included New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Randy White, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, 49ers running back Roger Craig, New England Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent. The replacement players were mostly those left out of work by the recent folding of the Canadian Football League\u2019s Montreal Alouettes and the 1986 dissolution of the United States Football League, as well as others who had been preseason cuts, had long left professional football or were other assorted oddities (such as cinematographer Todd Schlopy, who, despite never playing professional football before or after the strike, served as placekicker for his hometown Buffalo Bills for three games). The replacement players, called to play on short notice and having little chance to gel as teammates, were widely treated with scorn by the press and general public, including name-calling, public shaming and accusations of being scabs. The games played by these replacement players were regarded with even less legitimacy \u2013 attendance plummeted to under 10,000 fans at many of the games in smaller markets and cities with strong union presence, including a low of 4,074 for the lone replacement game played in Philadelphia) \u2014 but nonetheless were counted as regular NFL games. Final television revenues were down by about 20%, a smaller drop than the networks had expected. The defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants went 0\u20133 in replacement games, ultimately costing them a chance to make the playoffs and to repeat their championship. The final replacement game was a Monday Night Football matchup on October 19, 1987, with the Washington Redskins at the Dallas Cowboys. Along with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Redskins were the only other NFL team not to have any players cross the picket line and were surprising 13\u20137 victors over the Cowboys who had plenty of big name players cross the picket line.\n\nParagraph 2: Final opinions on the album were mixed. Hope called it \"an easy listen with the same soothing vocals and clean cut sing-a-long choruses we've grown to love. Overall a great offering but not overly addictive.\" Beringer praised the band's growth in musicianship in the years since From Here to Infirmary, but also commented that This Addiction \"could be polarizing to fans, splitting them into three groups: fans who love the album because it goes back to the band's roots, fans who dislike this album because they may think it's a cheap imitation of older days, and the fans who might think this is a step backwards from the previous album.\" Heisel concluded that \"while This Addiction might not be perfect, it's a more than respectable entry into the band's already sizeable canon, proving that though they may be in that rarified group of punk-rock lifers, Alkaline Trio aren't done evolving yet.\" Apar stated that although the album was purported to be a return to the early sound of Goddamnit, he found it more comparable to From Here to Infirmary \"since the end result is still the same polished album full of vaguely gothic and bloody references where characters like Draculina live -- no real bitterness, sore-throat defiance, or endearing heartache to be found.\" Though complimenting \"This Addiction\" and \"Off the Map\" as strong songs, he felt that the album failed to live up to its expectations as a return to roots: \"Alkaline Trio just can't seem to recapture the spirit of their early days, when purpose and emotion fueled every note. Instead, one is left with totally competent -- and at times, yes, catchy -- songs that ring just a bit too hollow compared to the urgent leave-it-all-on-the-floor guts of those earliest releases [...] despite the polished and punchy singalong choruses, This Addiction is really just more of the same recycled melodies from the Trio rather than any sort of rebirth.\" Andrew Kelham of Rock Sound agreed that the album did not succeed in recapturing the band's early sound, but was a strong effort nonetheless: \"Alkaline Trio aren't na\u00efve punk rockers from the Chicago suburbs anymore, as a result this album fails to recapture that innocence but succeeds in creating another strong body of work that the group can be proud of.\" Mikael Wood of Spin remarked that the \"cozier confines\" of an independent label \"appear to have put the band at ease\" and that their \"hooky, blood-soaked bad-love allegories [...] satisfy like heartburn-inducing comfort food.\" French concluded that \"This Addiction isn't so much a 'return to form,' but rather a summary--a sonic scrapbook of sorts that carefully documents their entire career, from sour home Chicago to the dressing rooms of Late Night with Conan O'Brien''.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Mitr Phol sugar business was established as a small family business in Ban Pong District, Ratchaburi Province, producing and trading condensed syrup to sugar mills in 1946. In 1956, the company began to produce its own sugar. In 1983, Mitr Phu Kieo Sugar Mill was constructed in Phu Khiao District, Chaiyaphum Province, with a sugarcane processing capacity of 27,000 tonnes per day. In 1990, Mitr Phol Sugar Mill in Suphanburi Province was established with a processing capacity of 45,500 tonnes per day. The company expanded its business internationally in 1993 to Guangxi Province, China with four mills. Mitr Phol owns seven sugar mills in Guangxi and with an annual capacity of approximately 10 million tonnes of cane, or approximately 1.3 million tonnes of sugar per year. In 1994, Mitr Phol Sugar Mill (Suphanburi Province) was the first mill in Thailand certified by ISO 9002 and has been recognized with a National Certificate of Excellence and Global Standards. In 1995, Mitr Phol took over a sugar company in Phu Wiang District, Khon Kaen Province and named it Mitr Phol Phu Wiang Sugar Mill. In 1997, Mitr Phol constructed a sugar mill in Hai Tung County, China. Later in the same year, Mitr Kalasin Sugar Mill was established, in Kuchinarai District, Kalasin Province, with a processing capacity of 23,000 tonnes per day. In 2006, Mitr Phol broadened its production to Savannakhet Province, Laos and established Mitr Lao Sugar Co., Ltd. to develop sugarcane farming with advanced production technology to export to the European Union. Mitr Phol further expanded its investments to Queensland, Australia.\n\nParagraph 4: Dating to the 15th century, it has been in ruins since at least 1657 when it was described as \"only old walls\". The church and graveyard are set in a very prominent position at the North end of a ridge. The graveyard is a substantial earthwork, now rectangular in plan, 52m E-W x 42m N-S. The East gable of the church stands to the original height, while the West gable is reduced to foundations. A cross slab of Early Christian type from the site is now built into the gable of the porch of the Catholic church in Chapeltown nearby \n\nParagraph 5: Rudolph Walker was born on 28 September 1939 in San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago. He began acting as an eight-year-old in primary school, going on to join Derek Walcott's Trinidad Theatre Workshop as its youngest member. With the aim of furthering his career he left the island at the age of 20 in 1960. He had been planning to go to the United States, where he had connections, but actor Errol John \u2014 who had already migrated to Britain but was in Trinidad doing a play \u2014 convinced him to go to the UK, where the training was considered to be superior.\n\nParagraph 6: The outside of the structure is an example of Italian medieval architecture with Gothic influences. The lower story is stone while the upper crenellated stories are made of brick.  The facade of the palace is curved slightly inwards (concave) to reflect the outwards curve (convex) of the Piazza del Campo, Siena's central square, of which the Palace is the focal point. At the top of this facade is a huge round flat bronze plate [Christogram], the symbol used by Saint Bernardino. It was placed there by the government in 1425 in gratitude to the great preacher, a native Sienese, for his sermons aimed at quelling social and political factionalism and unrest.\n\nParagraph 7: Rudolph Walker was born on 28 September 1939 in San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago. He began acting as an eight-year-old in primary school, going on to join Derek Walcott's Trinidad Theatre Workshop as its youngest member.

But, because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them, therefore they are to be translated in to the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that, the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner; and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.\u201dPursuant to the principles laid down in Overtoun that the question of whether a certain doctrine is in accord with the fundamental doctrines of a religious institution is purely a question of construction, the Court of Appeal went on to hold that (i) \u201cthe VPP doctrine is actually closely related to the VPI doctrine which both parties [i.e., FEBC and the Church] adhere to,\u201d (rejecting the Church's contention in [59] of the Court of Appeal Judgement that it is \u201can entirely different creature from the VPI doctrine\");\u201d(ii) \u201cthe College, in adopting the VPP doctrine, has not deviated from the fundamental principles which guide and inform the work of the College right from its inception, and as expressed in the Westminster Confession\u201d; (iii) [i]t is not inconsistent for a Christian who believes fully in the principles contained within the Westminster Confession (and the VPI [Verbal Plenary Inspiration] doctrine) to also subscribe to the VPP doctrine\u201d; and (iv) \u201c[i]n the absence of anything in the Westminster Confession that deals with the status of the apographs, we [the Judges of Appeal] hesitate to find that the VPP doctrine is a deviation from the principles contained within the Westminster Confession.\u201d\n\nParagraph 9: Phaneuf set a Flames record for most goals by a first-year defenceman and was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in 2005\u201306. Two years later, he was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman. During his career, Phaneuf was involved in two blockbuster trades. The first came in late 2009, when he was involved in a seven-player trade that saw him move from Calgary to Toronto. Six years later, Phaneuf was the centrepiece of a nine-player trade that saw him sent to Ottawa. He was traded to Los Angeles nearing the trade deadline in February 2018.\n\nParagraph 10: Foreign relations between neighbouring countries Australia and New Zealand, also referred to as Trans-Tasman relations, are extremely close. Both countries share a British colonial heritage as antipodean Dominions and settler colonies, and both are part of the core Anglosphere. New Zealand sent representatives to the constitutional conventions which led to the uniting of the six Australian colonies but opted not to join. In the Boer War and in both world wars, New Zealand soldiers fought alongside Australian soldiers. In recent years the Closer Economic Relations free trade agreement and its predecessors have inspired ever-converging economic integration. Despite some shared similarities, the cultures of Australia and New Zealand also have their own sets of differences and there are sometimes differences of opinion which some have declared as symptomatic of sibling rivalry. This often centres upon sports and in commercio-economic tensions, such as those arising from the failure of Ansett Australia and those engendered by the formerly long-standing Australian ban on New Zealand apple imports.\n\nParagraph 11: Phaneuf set a Flames record for most goals by a first-year defenceman and was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in 2005\u201306.

She is described in the T\u00e9l\u00e9toon profile as the best friend character, affectionate and not afraid to show her feelings. She enjoys sports and athletics but also shares her friends' fashion interests. She is the most naive and absent-minded of the three, sometimes interpreting figures of speech literally, often thinking it was actually going dark just because something is blocking her sight, or picking up and eating foodstuff at crime scenes that is potentially harmful. In the episode \"Do You Believe In Magic\", it is revealed Alex is the youngest of the three girls (and Clover the oldest). Her driving ability becomes a running gag in some episodes, despite the fact that she keeps getting to take the wheel and proves to be capable of improvising dangerous car stunts. She is sensitive and sometimes gets down on herself. Starting with season 3, Alex reveals interests in Taekwondo, skateboarding, soccer and video games. Alex appears to be racially mixed at first, having a dark-skinned mother and a white father in the season 4 episode \"Alex Gets Schooled\"; however, her father later appears with a completely different physical appearance, notably with dark skin in the season 6 episode \"Evil Ice Skater\". In Totally Spies! The Movie, which takes place when the girls first transfer to Beverly Hills High, she adopts a piglet whom she names  (), who does not appear in seasons 1-5 but recurs in season 6 when the girls have already gone to college. Although Alex says she is allergic to cats in season 1 episode \"Wild Style\", in \"Evil Mascot\", she handles Sigmund Smith's stray kitten without any allergic reaction, and she later works in a university cat lab in season 6 episode \"Nine Lives\" without problems. Like Sam and Clover, her last name has never been revealed but in \"Evil Ice Skater,\" Jerry refers to her father as \"Dr. Casoy\" but it's unknown if that's Alex's last name or not. \n\nParagraph 13: The porae has a body which is compressed and moderately short and deep, its depth being around two fifths of its standard length, with a very thin caudal peduncle. It has a moderately sized head which has a shallow dorsal profile and there is a small over the eyes in adults. There are no bony protuberances on the snout or to the front of the moderately sized eyes. It has a small mouth, which does not extend as far as the eyes, with thick and fleshy lips. The teeth are small and pointed and arranged in a single row in each jaw and they are embedded in the lips. There is a patch of smaller teeth to the rear of the main row in the front of the upper jaw. The dorsal fin is continuous, with a long base and only slight demarcation between the spiny part and the soft rayed part which are both of similar length. The spiny part is tallest at the front and decreases in height to the rear while the soft rayed part is of a uniform low height. The anal fin is similar in shape but slightly shorter than soft rayed part of the dorsal fin. The caudal fin is forked with the tips of both lobes bluntly pointed. The pectoral fins are of moderate size with its upper rays branched and its lower rays simple and robust with uppermost of these rays being highly elongated, extending almost to the middle of the anal fin. The pelvic fins are small and are placed obviously under and to the rear of the origin of the pectoral fins. The spiny part of the dorsal fin contains 17-18 spines while the soft rayed part holds 27-28 fin rays, the anal fin has 3 spines and 16-17 soft rays. This species attains a maximum fork length of  and a maximum published weight of . The overall colour is silvery, tinged with greenish-blue. or occasionally yellowish dorsally, paler silvery on the lower body. The fins may show a bluish tinge. The juveniles have a dark blotch just below middle of the lateral line, this fades as the fish grows.\n\nParagraph 14: Zell was born at Hanau am Main, date unknown. He learned the art of printing before 1462 in the printing establishment of Johann Fust and Peter Sch\u00f6ffer, and seems, shortly after the catastrophe of 1462, to have gone to Cologne, whose university gave promise of a market for printed works. Zell was printing at Cologne apparently as early as 1463, although his first dated book is 1466. His work as printer and publisher can be traced up to the year 1502; altogether about 120 of his publications are known. Of these, however, only nine bear his name, but in all probability he printed and published many more. In outline and cut his six kinds of type are strikingly similar to the \"Durandus\" and \"Clements\" types of Fust and Schoffer; it would even seem that a number of the matrices of the \"Clements\" type had been used. Most of the books printed by Zell were text-books in quarto form for the university. Among the fine productions of his printing shop is an undated edition of the Latin Bible in two volumes. At first he called himself clericus (of the lower orders), but as early as 1471 he married and became a citizen and householder of Cologne. In 1473 he bought the important manorial estate of \"Lyskirchen\", to which he transferred the main part of his business. In the colophons of his books the place of business is called \"apud Lyskirchen\". The purchase, sometime later, of various houses, lands, and properties yielding revenues, show that Zell had become a prosperous man. It is also proof of his importance that for a long time he filled the office of Kirchenmeister (church-master) of \"S. Maria an Lyskirchen\". Of much importance in the history of the discovery of printing is Zell's statement, preserved in the Chronicle of Cologne of 1499, that the year 1450 was the date of the beginning of printing, that the country-squire Johann Gutenberg was the inventor of it, and that the first book printed was the Latin Bible, the Vulgate.\n\nParagraph 15: The three pilot Town Councils were deemed to be highly successful and led to the introduction of the Town Councils Bill in Parliament in May 1988. Goh Chok Tong, who would eventually become Prime Minister in 1990, argued in Parliament that Town Councils not only provided for greater resident participation, but also would act as \"political stabilisers\". He cited the fact that in other democracies, e.g. Britain, there were inherent factors that resulted in greater political stability, such as long-term allegiances of constituencies to a certain political party. But in Singapore, ... it is the PAP which provides the political stability.  There is no other party at present which can effectively govern Singapore.  But this political stability can be threatened by sudden temporary swings in national mood.  If there are such swings, the PAP can be out of power.  If that happens, political instability will result because no alternative leadership has emerged which can effectively govern Singapore. Goh also noted in the same speech in Parliament that voters were confident that after decades of uninterrupted PAP rule, that even if they elected Opposition candidates to Parliament that they would still have a competent PAP Government managing their constituencies, which would result in a \"free-rider\" problem: For example, some voters who want a PAP Government also want to see some Opposition MPs. They may vote for an Opposition candidate and depend on the PAP to look after their constituency because they expect other constituencies to return PAP candidates in sufficient numbers to form the government. Chiam See Tong, the MP for Potong Pasir and one of only two non-PAP MPs at that time, spoke at length rejecting the bill. Chiam argued that the role of an MP was to give direction to a nation, and not to manage municipal matters:A party is elected because of its policy. The people may want the party to represent them so that the nation can move in a particular direction.  The PAP first came into power on a socialist platform.  People of Singapore voted them in because they thought that was good for Singapore and so they went on a socialist principle, up to lately, of course.  Some people may want to vote people like Margaret Thatcher, free enterprise, the capitalist line.  You vote her in.  So that is the purpose of voting Members of Parliament and a particular party.  But you do not vote a Town Councillor to change the direction or have a national policy in regard whether to foreign policy or to national policies on education or defence, or how you should have a relationship with your neighbours.  These are not the work of town councillors.  These are the work of Members of Parliament.  So there is a distinct different role.He also noted that most MPs did not stay in the same constituency, let alone the same housing estate, of their residents, and would therefore not add much value to the residents in such matters. He proposed that Town Councils should be made non-political, but was rebutted by Lee Hsien Loong that MPs should care for their constituents as much as they cared about lawmaking:If any MP stands in the next election and says, \"Please elect me. I will pay no attention to municipal matters. You go and find some non-political Town Councillor on your own to manage that and you have it out with HDB should anything happen\", I do not think he is going to be elected. I do not think the Member for Potong Pasir will put that in the SDP manifesto. Will he? Perhaps not.Ultimately, PAP's supermajority in Parliament allowed it to pass the bill into law without further consultation.\n\nParagraph 16: A 24-day players' strike was called after Week 2. The games that were scheduled for the third week of the season were cancelled, reducing the 16-game season to 15, but the games for Weeks 4, 5 and 6 were played with replacement players.

Final television revenues were down by about 20%, a smaller drop than the networks had expected. The defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants went 0\u20133 in replacement games, ultimately costing them a chance to make the playoffs and to repeat their championship. The final replacement game was a Monday Night Football matchup on October 19, 1987, with the Washington Redskins at the Dallas Cowboys. Along with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Redskins were the only other NFL team not to have any players cross the picket line and were surprising 13\u20137 victors over the Cowboys who had plenty of big name players cross the picket line.\n\nParagraph 17: Mitr Phol sugar business was established as a small family business in Ban Pong District, Ratchaburi Province, producing and trading condensed syrup to sugar mills in 1946. In 1956, the company began to produce its own sugar. In 1983, Mitr Phu Kieo Sugar Mill was constructed in Phu Khiao District, Chaiyaphum Province, with a sugarcane processing capacity of 27,000 tonnes per day. In 1990, Mitr Phol Sugar Mill in Suphanburi Province was established with a processing capacity of 45,500 tonnes per day. The company expanded its business internationally in 1993 to Guangxi Province, China with four mills. Mitr Phol owns seven sugar mills in Guangxi and with an annual capacity of approximately 10 million tonnes of cane, or approximately 1.3 million tonnes of sugar per year. In 1994, Mitr Phol Sugar Mill (Suphanburi Province) was the first mill in Thailand certified by ISO 9002 and has been recognized with a National Certificate of Excellence and Global Standards. In 1995, Mitr Phol took over a sugar company in Phu Wiang District, Khon Kaen Province and named it Mitr Phol Phu Wiang Sugar Mill. In 1997, Mitr Phol constructed a sugar mill in Hai Tung County, China. Later in the same year, Mitr Kalasin Sugar Mill was established, in Kuchinarai District, Kalasin Province, with a processing capacity of 23,000 tonnes per day. In 2006, Mitr Phol broadened its production to Savannakhet Province, Laos and established Mitr Lao Sugar Co., Ltd. to develop sugarcane farming with advanced production technology to export to the European Union. Mitr Phol further expanded its investments to Queensland, Australia.\n\nParagraph 18: Phaneuf set a Flames record for most goals by a first-year defenceman and was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in 2005\u201306. Two years later, he was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman. During his career, Phaneuf was involved in two blockbuster trades. The first came in late 2009, when he was involved in a seven-player trade that saw him move from Calgary to Toronto. Six years later, Phaneuf was the centrepiece of a nine-player trade that saw him sent to Ottawa. He was traded to Los Angeles nearing the trade deadline in February 2018.\n\nParagraph 19: The Alhambra Decree (also known as the Edict of Expulsion; Spanish: Decreto de la Alhambra, Edicto de Granada) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) ordering the expulsion of practising Jews from the Crowns of Castile and Aragon and its territories and possessions by 31 July of that year. The primary purpose was to eliminate the influence of practising Jews on Spain's large formerly-Jewish converso New Christian population, to ensure the latter and their descendants did not revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jews had converted as a result of the religious persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391. Due to continuing attacks, around 50,000 more had converted by 1415. A further number of those remaining chose to convert to avoid expulsion. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in the years leading up to the expulsion, of Spain's estimated 300,000 Jewish origin population, a total of over 200,000 had converted to Catholicism to remain in Spain, and between 40,000 and 100,000 remained Jewish and suffered expulsion. An unknown number of the expelled eventually succumbed to the pressures of life in exile away from formerly-Jewish relatives and networks back in Spain, and so converted to Catholicism to be allowed to return in the years following expulsion.:17\n\nParagraph 20: For their first match of Stage 4, which would include the implementation of an enforced 2-2-2 role lock by the league, the Titans faced the Dragons in a rematch of the Stage 3 Semifinals; Vancouver took their revenge and won the match 3\u20131. Three days later, the team took on the Florida Mayhem. Vancouver's DPS Kim \"Haksal\" Hyo-jong on Genji dominated throughout the match, as he amassed 27 Dragonblade kills during the match to set an Overwatch League record for most Dragonblade kills per 10 minutes, and the Titans went on to sweep the Mayhem 4\u20130. The following week, the Titans faced the Washington Justice. Justice's DPS Corey \"Corey\" Nigra led the Justice throughout the match, as he broke the Overwatch League record for critical hit accuracy on Hanzo; in a major upset, the Justice handed the Titans their first-ever 0\u20134 loss and only their second loss in the entire regular season. The team took on the London Spitfire on August 8 for their first match of week three. While the Spitfire took map one Busan, the Titans came right back with their own win on map two Temple of Anubis to tie up the series. The teams split the next to maps to push the match into a fifth tiebreaker map; Vancouver edged out London on Ilios and won the match 3\u20132. The team's next match was against the Philadelphia Fusion three days later; the Titans took a clean 4\u20130 win. For their final week of play, the Titans headed to The Novo in Los Angeles to play in the Kit Kat Rivalry Weekend, hosted by the Los Angeles Valiant. Vancouver's first match of the weekend was against the San Francisco Shock on August 24. It was the fourth meeting between the two teams in the 2019 season, and the Titans held a 2\u20131 head-to-head record over the Shock. After dismantling the Shock on Lijiang Tower, Vancouver fell on Volskaya Industries. The two teams traded wins on maps three and four, pushing the match to a fifth tiebreaker match; the Titans were dominated on map five, leading to a 2\u20133 match loss. The team's final match of the regular season was against the Atlantic Division Champions New York Excelsior a day later. The two teams traded map wins throughout the match; after four maps the series was tied, forcing the match to a fifth map. Vancouver and New York both took a point in the final map, Lijiang Tower, but the Titans came out on top close out the regular season with a 3\u20132 match victory.\n\nParagraph 21: Dating to the 15th century, it has been in ruins since at least 1657 when it was described as \"only old walls\". The church and graveyard are set in a very prominent position at the North end of a ridge. The graveyard is a substantial earthwork, now rectangular in plan, 52m E-W x 42m N-S. The East gable of the church stands to the original height, while the West gable is reduced to foundations. A cross slab of Early Christian type from the site is now built into the gable of the porch of the Catholic church in Chapeltown nearby \n\nParagraph 22:  Long-term interest rates (average yields for 10yr government bonds in the past year): Shall be no more than 2.0 percentage points higher than the unweighted arithmetic average of the similar 10-year government bond yields in the 3 EU member states with the lowest HICP inflation (having qualified as benchmark countries for the calculation of the HICP reference value). If any of the 3 EU member states in concern are suffering from interest rates significantly higher than the \"GDP-weighted eurozone average interest rate\", and at the same time by the end of the assessment period have no complete funding access to the financial lending markets (which will be the case for as long as a country is unable to issue new government bonds with 10-year maturity \u2013 instead being dependent on disbursements from a sovereign state bailout programme), then such a country will not qualify as a benchmark country for the reference value; which then only will be calculated upon data from fewer than 3 EU member states. In example, Ireland was found to be an interest rate outlier not qualifying for the reference value calculation in the assessment month March 2012, when it was measured to have a long-term interest rate average being 4.71 percentage points above the eurozone average \u2013 while at the same time having no complete access to the financial lending markets. When Ireland was assessed again in April 2013, it was, however, deemed no longer to be an outlier, due to posting a long-term interest rate average only 1.59 percentage points above the eurozone average \u2013 while also having regained complete access to the financial lending markets for the last 1.5 month of the assessment period. A final relevant example appeared in April 2014, when Portugal likewise was found not to be an interest rate outlier, due to posting a long-term interest rate average being 2.89 percentage points above the eurozone average \u2013 while having regained complete access to the financial lending markets for the last 12 months of the assessment period.\n\nParagraph 23: Also for reasons of historical verisimilitude, factions, provinces on the campaign map and factions' family members have been given vernacular names in Europa Barbarorum, rather than having Latinised or Anglicised ones, as in Rome: Total War. So, for instance, the original game's Armenia faction is known as Hayasdan in Europa Barbarorum, and Germania as the Sweboz. Instead of having to play one's first campaign as a Roman faction and only subsequently unlock playable campaigns as non-Romans by defeating them in the Roman campaign, all twenty of Europa Barbarorums playable factions can be accessed by the player from the start. Furthermore, the one unplayable and three playable Roman factions of the original have been combined into a single playable faction in Europa Barbarorum, the Romani. Dissatisfied with the homogeneity of the factions of the original Rome: Total War, the Europa Barbarorum development team have sought to differentiate the playing experiences of the game's different factions. So, for example, Rome: Total Wars trait-acquisition system, where the player's faction's family members acquire certain characteristics and talents which make them more or less adept at certain tasks such as city management or military leadership, has been made more faction-specific in Europa Barbarorum, with Hellenic characters' traits, for instance, being based on Theophrastos' Characters and Aristotle's teachings on the Golden Mean, and Romans' traits being partially based on the moral tales of Valerius Maximus. There are sometimes additional requirements for a family member to be able to gain a new trait: in order for them to compete in one of the Panhellenic Games, for instance, the player must ensure that they are stationed in the appropriate city on the campaign map in the year that the competition is scheduled to take place. One reviewer has commented that Europa Barbarorums expansions upon the original Rome: Total Wars trait system have served to add a role-playing element to the game.\n\nParagraph 24: Dating to the 15th century, it has been in ruins since at least 1657 when it was described as \"only old walls\".

In the mid 1400s it was used to create the Pope Alexander VII Dioscorides, now in the Vatican Library, by the monks of St. John the Baptist Greek orthodox monastery in Constantinople. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 a subsequent owner handwrote each plant's name in Arabic and Hebrew. The manuscript, still in Istanbul a century after the fall of the city, was purchased from Moses Hamon, the Arabic-speaking, Jewish physician to sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, by the Flemish diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, who was in the employ of Emperor Ferdinand I of the Austrian Habsburgs. The manuscript is now held among the manuscripts of the Austrian National Library () in Vienna, where it is identified as the Codex Vindobonensis med. gr. 1. The manuscript was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 1997 in recognition of its historical significance.\n\nParagraph 26: Also for reasons of historical verisimilitude, factions, provinces on the campaign map and factions' family members have been given vernacular names in Europa Barbarorum, rather than having Latinised or Anglicised ones, as in Rome: Total War.

The lower story is stone while the upper crenellated stories are made of brick.  The facade of the palace is curved slightly inwards (concave) to reflect the outwards curve (convex) of the Piazza del Campo, Siena's central square, of which the Palace is the focal point. At the top of this facade is a huge round flat bronze plate [Christogram], the symbol used by Saint Bernardino. It was placed there by the government in 1425 in gratitude to the great preacher, a native Sienese, for his sermons aimed at quelling social and political factionalism and unrest.\n\nParagraph 30: Dating to the 15th century, it has been in ruins since at least 1657 when it was described as \"only old walls\".

Species-specific defence reactions are innate responses demonstrated by an animal when they experience a threat. Since survival behaviours are so vital for an animal to acquire and demonstrate rapidly, it has been theorized that these defence reactions would not have time to be learned and therefore, must be innate. While these behaviours are species-specific, there are three general categories of defence reactions - fleeing, freezing, and threatening. Species-specific defence reactions are now recognized as being organized in a hierarchical system where different behaviours are exhibited, depending on the level of threat experienced. However, when this concept was first proposed, the dominant species-specific defence reaction in a certain context was thought to be controlled by operant conditioning. That is, if a species-specific defence reaction was unsuccessful in evading or controlling conflict, the hierarchical system would be rearranged because of the punishment, in the form of failure, experienced by an animal. It would then be unlikely for that species-specific defence reaction to be used in a similar situation again; instead, an alternative behaviour would be dominant. However, if the dominant behaviour was successful it would remain the recurring behaviour for that situation. After experimentation, this theory was met with much opposition, even by the person who proposed it. One point of opposition was found through the use of shock on rats and the species-specific defence reaction of freezing. This experiment found that while punishment did seem to affect freezing, it was not through response weakening but through the evoking of different levels of the behaviour. Other criticisms for this theory focused on the inability for species-specific defence reactions to effectively rearrange in this manner in natural situations. It has been argued that there would not be enough time for punishment, in the form of an animal being unsuccessful in its defence, to reorder the hierarchy of species-specific defence reactions. The rejection of the operant conditioning mechanism for the reorganization of species-specific defence reactions, led to the development of the predatory imminence continuum. The organization of defensive behaviours can be attributed to the level of threat an animal perceives itself to be in. This theory is one of adaptiveness, as the dominant defence reaction is the behaviour which is most effective in allowing the survival of the animal and the one which is most effective in preventing an increasing level of threat, also known as increasing imminence. The probability of being killed by a predator, known as predatory imminence, is what is responsible for the expressed defensive behaviour. The predatory imminence is dependent on many factors such as the distance from a predator, the potential for escape, and the likelihood of meeting a predator. Three general categories of defensive behaviours, based on increasing predatory imminence, have been identified. These are labelled as pre-encounter, post-encounter, and circa-strike defensive behaviours.\n\nParagraph 32: Mitr Phol sugar business was established as a small family business in Ban Pong District, Ratchaburi Province, producing and trading condensed syrup to sugar mills in 1946.

Irfan and Sameera become best friends from enemies, and Sagar and Sameera are in a relationship. Rekha, childhood friend of Sagar, loves Sagar and Sagar's brother Rahul is a close ally of James. As Rekha is rich, Rahul and Sagar's mother want to marry Rekha to Sagar. Sagar, jealous of the growing friendship between Sammera and Irfan, badly beats her up and tries to rape her, and while escaping she falls down a flight of stairs and her leg is broken. Due to this, Sameera breaks off her marriage to Sagar. James frames Sameera falsely in a drug case and Sagar's family emotionally blackmail him into marrying Rekha. Irfan and Wilson help Sameera to get released from jail. Rekha tests HIV positive and everyone except Sagar, Rahul and Sameera shun her and illtreat her. Jagan comes to meet Wilson, threatens Sameera whole asking for Wilson and Sameera pushes him in self defense. Japan gets a head injury and forgets his past life. Sameera asks Irfan's help to save Jagan, and it is revealed that Jagan falsely testified against Sameera as a witness in the drug case and later rescinded it after being blackmailed. Rekha realizes the kind nature of Sameera and decides to reunite Sagar and Sameera, who have broken up due to Sagar's violent nature, misunderstanding caused by Rekha in-between the two and Sagar sleeping with Rekha while being in a relation with Sameera. Sameera refuses. Banerjee wants to kill Jagan, James, Gayathri and DIG Sreenivas, wanting revenge on Irfan, provoke Banerjee into attacking Wilson, who gets Banerjee arrested. Banerjee tells Wilson and Irfan that Jangan killed his son and his wife died of shock. Wilson, having lost Iqbal similarly decides to hand over Jagan to Banerjee. Seeing Sameera in danger, Jagan decides to surrender, but falls unconscious and remembers his past. It is revealed that Banerjee killed Jagan's parents when they found out the wrongdoings of Banerjee, took in Jagan and when found out that Jagan collected proofs against him, Banerjee planted a bomb in his car, and killed his own son, and his wife died due to shock. Sagar, seeing Jagan and Sameera close in college, violently takes her to a secluded place, attacks her and while trying to escape Sameera gets badly injured and goes into coma. Irfan finds out the truth, Indra gets Sagar arrested and Rekha takes Sravanthi's side. After Sameera gains consciousness, they decide to take the case back to save Sagar's career and warn him not to repeat this with anyone else or they will go to court next time. Sagar realizes his love for Rekha, Rahul insults Sameera in college. Despite all this, Jagan and Sameera fall in love, Sravanthi finds out Zubeida/Vennela is her daughter, Vennela gives birth to her and Irfan's son Iqbal, and she is taken to Australia. Wilson makes everyone believe Vennela is dead, makes James believe he killed her and gets James and Gayathri arrested for all their wrongdoings. They discover that Vennela is alive. James, unable to bear that Gayathri may kill herself due to her mental imbalance and staying away from James, begs Wilson and Indra's father to take back the case. They see the condition of Gayathri and out of humanity take the case back with a warning to James to never come near them again. James takes Gayathri to America after trying to search for Hema, writes a letter to Indra's father and sends a bouquet to Sameera and Jagan for their wedding, and writes in the letter expressing regret for his actions all these years, asks him to take care of Gayathri if anything happens to James. Jagan and Sameera get married and Chakravam comes to a happy end.\n\nParagraph 36: The  Kaj Strand Telescope (or Kaj Strand Astrometric Reflector, KSAR) remains the largest telescope operated by the U.S. Navy. Congress appropriated funding in 1961 and it saw first light in 1964. This status will change when the NPOI four 1.8-meter telescopes see their own first light in the near future. KSAR rides in the arms of an equatorial fork mount. The telescope is used in both the visible spectrum, and in the near infrared (NIR), the latter using a sub-30-kelvin, helium-refrigerated, InSb (Indium antimonide) camera, \"Astrocam\". In 1978, the 1.55-m telescope was used to \"discover the moon of dwarf planet Pluto, named 'Charon'\". (Pluto itself was discovered in 1930, across town at Lowell Observatory). The Charon discovery led to mass calculations which ultimately revealed how tiny Pluto was, and eventually caused the IAU to reclassify Pluto as a dwarf (not a principal) planet. The 1.55-meter telescope was also used to observe and track NASA's Deep Impact Spacecraft, as it navigated to a successful inter-planetary impact with the celebrated Comet 9p/Tempel, in 2005. This telescope is particularly well-suited to perform stellar parallax studies, narrow-field astrometry supporting space navigation, and has also played a key role in discovering one of the coolest-ever known brown dwarf objects, in 2002. The KSAR dome is centrally located on NOFS grounds, with support and office buildings attached to the dome structures. The large vacuum coating chamber facility is also located in this complex. The chamber can provide very accurate coatings and overcoatings of  Angstrom thickness (approximately 56 aluminium atoms thick), for small-to-multi-ton optics up to  in diameter, in a vacuum exceeding , using a vertical-optic, 1500-ampere discharge system. A dielectric coating capability has also been demonstrated. Large optics and telescope components can be moved about NOFS using its suite of cranes, lifts, cargo elevators and specialized carts. The main complex also contains a controlled-environment, optical and electronics lab for laser, adaptive optics, optics development, collimation, mechanical, and micro-electronic control systems needed for NOFS and NPOI.\n\nParagraph 37: Alexandra has short black hair, light brown eyes, and dark skin; she dons a yellow catsuit on missions. She is described in the T\u00e9l\u00e9toon profile as the best friend character, affectionate and not afraid to show her feelings. She enjoys sports and athletics but also shares her friends' fashion interests. She is the most naive and absent-minded of the three, sometimes interpreting figures of speech literally, often thinking it was actually going dark just because something is blocking her sight, or picking up and eating foodstuff at crime scenes that is potentially harmful. In the episode \"Do You Believe In Magic\", it is revealed Alex is the youngest of the three girls (and Clover the oldest). Her driving ability becomes a running gag in some episodes, despite the fact that she keeps getting to take the wheel and proves to be capable of improvising dangerous car stunts. She is sensitive and sometimes gets down on herself. Starting with season 3, Alex reveals interests in Taekwondo, skateboarding, soccer and video games. Alex appears to be racially mixed at first, having a dark-skinned mother and a white father in the season 4 episode \"Alex Gets Schooled\"; however, her father later appears with a completely different physical appearance, notably with dark skin in the season 6 episode \"Evil Ice Skater\". In Totally Spies! The Movie, which takes place when the girls first transfer to Beverly Hills High, she adopts a piglet whom she names  (), who does not appear in seasons 1-5 but recurs in season 6 when the girls have already gone to college. Although Alex says she is allergic to cats in season 1 episode \"Wild Style\", in \"Evil Mascot\", she handles Sigmund Smith's stray kitten without any allergic reaction, and she later works in a university cat lab in season 6 episode \"Nine Lives\" without problems. Like Sam and Clover, her last name has never been revealed but in \"Evil Ice Skater,\" Jerry refers to her father as \"Dr. Casoy\" but it's unknown if that's Alex's last name or not. \n\nParagraph 38: It is useful to keep in mind that although the waves traverse the entire expansion chamber over each cycle, the actual gases leaving the cylinder during a particular cycle do not. The gas flows and stops intermittently and the wave continues on to the end of the pipe. The hot gases leaving the port form a \"slug\" which fills the header pipe and remains there for the duration of that cycle. This causes a high temperature zone in the head pipe which is always filled with the most recent and hottest gas. Because this area is hotter, the speed of sound and thus the speed of the waves that travel through it are increased. During the next cycle that slug of gas will be pushed down the pipe by the next slug to occupy the next zone and so on. The volume this \"slug\" occupies constantly varies according to throttle position and engine speed. It is only the wave energy itself that traverses the whole pipe during a single cycle. The actual gas leaving the pipe during a particular cycle was created two or three cycles earlier. This is why exhaust gas sampling on two stroke engines is done with a special valve right in the exhaust port. The gas exiting the stinger has had too much resident time and mixing with gas from other cycles causing errors in analysis.\n\nParagraph 39: A 24-day players' strike was called after Week 2. The games that were scheduled for the third week of the season were cancelled, reducing the 16-game season to 15, but the games for Weeks 4, 5 and 6 were played with replacement players. The NFLPA actually ended the strike before the Week 6 slate of games, but the NFL owners' unanimously nixed their return that week because the union had missed an owner-mandated deadline that week to be eligible to return, and would have to wait until Week 7 to resume playing. Approximately 15% of the NFLPA\u2019s players chose to cross picket lines to play during the strike; prominent players who did so included New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Randy White, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, 49ers running back Roger Craig, New England Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent. The replacement players were mostly those left out of work by the recent folding of the Canadian Football League\u2019s Montreal Alouettes and the 1986 dissolution of the United States Football League, as well as others who had been preseason cuts, had long left professional football or were other assorted oddities (such as cinematographer Todd Schlopy, who, despite never playing professional football before or after the strike, served as placekicker for his hometown Buffalo Bills for three games). The replacement players, called to play on short notice and having little chance to gel as teammates, were widely treated with scorn by the press and general public, including name-calling, public shaming and accusations of being scabs. The games played by these replacement players were regarded with even less legitimacy \u2013 attendance plummeted to under 10,000 fans at many of the games in smaller markets and cities with strong union presence, including a low of 4,074 for the lone replacement game played in Philadelphia) \u2014 but nonetheless were counted as regular NFL games. Final television revenues were down by about 20%, a smaller drop than the networks had expected. The defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants went 0\u20133 in replacement games, ultimately costing them a chance to make the playoffs and to repeat their championship. The final replacement game was a Monday Night Football matchup on October 19, 1987, with the Washington Redskins at the Dallas Cowboys. Along with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Redskins were the only other NFL team not to have any players cross the picket line and were surprising 13\u20137 victors over the Cowboys who had plenty of big name players cross the picket line.\n\nParagraph 40: Sameera comes to India and lives with Raghavamma. Irfan and Sameera become best friends from enemies, and Sagar and Sameera are in a relationship. Rekha, childhood friend of Sagar, loves Sagar and Sagar's brother Rahul is a close ally of James. As Rekha is rich, Rahul and Sagar's mother want to marry Rekha to Sagar. Sagar, jealous of the growing friendship between Sammera and Irfan, badly beats her up and tries to rape her, and while escaping she falls down a flight of stairs and her leg is broken. Due to this, Sameera breaks off her marriage to Sagar. James frames Sameera falsely in a drug case and Sagar's family emotionally blackmail him into marrying Rekha. Irfan and Wilson help Sameera to get released from jail. Rekha tests HIV positive and everyone except Sagar, Rahul and Sameera shun her and illtreat her. Jagan comes to meet Wilson, threatens Sameera whole asking for Wilson and Sameera pushes him in self defense. Japan gets a head injury and forgets his past life. Sameera asks Irfan's help to save Jagan, and it is revealed that Jagan falsely testified against Sameera as a witness in the drug case and later rescinded it after being blackmailed. Rekha realizes the kind nature of Sameera and decides to reunite Sagar and Sameera, who have broken up due to Sagar's violent nature, misunderstanding caused by Rekha in-between the two and Sagar sleeping with Rekha while being in a relation with Sameera. Sameera refuses. Banerjee wants to kill Jagan, James, Gayathri and DIG Sreenivas, wanting revenge on Irfan, provoke Banerjee into attacking Wilson, who gets Banerjee arrested. Banerjee tells Wilson and Irfan that Jangan killed his son and his wife died of shock. Wilson, having lost Iqbal similarly decides to hand over Jagan to Banerjee. Seeing Sameera in danger, Jagan decides to surrender, but falls unconscious and remembers his past. It is revealed that Banerjee killed Jagan's parents when they found out the wrongdoings of Banerjee, took in Jagan and when found out that Jagan collected proofs against him, Banerjee planted a bomb in his car, and killed his own son, and his wife died due to shock. Sagar, seeing Jagan and Sameera close in college, violently takes her to a secluded place, attacks her and while trying to escape Sameera gets badly injured and goes into coma. Irfan finds out the truth, Indra gets Sagar arrested and Rekha takes Sravanthi's side. After Sameera gains consciousness, they decide to take the case back to save Sagar's career and warn him not to repeat this with anyone else or they will go to court next time. Sagar realizes his love for Rekha, Rahul insults Sameera in college. Despite all this, Jagan and Sameera fall in love, Sravanthi finds out Zubeida/Vennela is her daughter, Vennela gives birth to her and Irfan's son Iqbal, and she is taken to Australia. Wilson makes everyone believe Vennela is dead, makes James believe he killed her and gets James and Gayathri arrested for all their wrongdoings. They discover that Vennela is alive. James, unable to bear that Gayathri may kill herself due to her mental imbalance and staying away from James, begs Wilson and Indra's father to take back the case. They see the condition of Gayathri and out of humanity take the case back with a warning to James to never come near them again. James takes Gayathri to America after trying to search for Hema, writes a letter to Indra's father and sends a bouquet to Sameera and Jagan for their wedding, and writes in the letter expressing regret for his actions all these years, asks him to take care of Gayathri if anything happens to James. Jagan and Sameera get married and Chakravam comes to a happy end.\n\nParagraph 41: Zell was born at Hanau am Main, date unknown. He learned the art of printing before 1462 in the printing establishment of Johann Fust and Peter Sch\u00f6ffer, and seems, shortly after the catastrophe of 1462, to have gone to Cologne, whose university gave promise of a market for printed works. Zell was printing at Cologne apparently as early as 1463, although his first dated book is 1466. His work as printer and publisher can be traced up to the year 1502; altogether about 120 of his publications are known. Of these, however, only nine bear his name, but in all probability he printed and published many more. In outline and cut his six kinds of type are strikingly similar to the \"Durandus\" and \"Clements\" types of Fust and Schoffer; it would even seem that a number of the matrices of the \"Clements\" type had been used. Most of the books printed by Zell were text-books in quarto form for the university. Among the fine productions of his printing shop is an undated edition of the Latin Bible in two volumes. At first he called himself clericus (of the lower orders), but as early as 1471 he married and became a citizen and householder of Cologne. In 1473 he bought the important manorial estate of \"Lyskirchen\", to which he transferred the main part of his business. In the colophons of his books the place of business is called \"apud Lyskirchen\". The purchase, sometime later, of various houses, lands, and properties yielding revenues, show that Zell had become a prosperous man. It is also proof of his importance that for a long time he filled the office of Kirchenmeister (church-master) of \"S. Maria an Lyskirchen\". Of much importance in the history of the discovery of printing is Zell's statement, preserved in the Chronicle of Cologne of 1499, that the year 1450 was the date of the beginning of printing, that the country-squire Johann Gutenberg was the inventor of it, and that the first book printed was the Latin Bible, the Vulgate.\n\nParagraph 42: A 24-day players' strike was called after Week 2.

Hope called it \"an easy listen with the same soothing vocals and clean cut sing-a-long choruses we've grown to love. Overall a great offering but not overly addictive.\" Beringer praised the band's growth in musicianship in the years since From Here to Infirmary, but also commented that This Addiction \"could be polarizing to fans, splitting them into three groups: fans who love the album because it goes back to the band's roots, fans who dislike this album because they may think it's a cheap imitation of older days, and the fans who might think this is a step backwards from the previous album.\" Heisel concluded that \"while This Addiction might not be perfect, it's a more than respectable entry into the band's already sizeable canon, proving that though they may be in that rarified group of punk-rock lifers, Alkaline Trio aren't done evolving yet.\" Apar stated that although the album was purported to be a return to the early sound of Goddamnit, he found it more comparable to From Here to Infirmary \"since the end result is still the same polished album full of vaguely gothic and bloody references where characters like Draculina live -- no real bitterness, sore-throat defiance, or endearing heartache to be found.\" Though complimenting \"This Addiction\" and \"Off the Map\" as strong songs, he felt that the album failed to live up to its expectations as a return to roots: \"Alkaline Trio just can't seem to recapture the spirit of their early days, when purpose and emotion fueled every note. Instead, one is left with totally competent -- and at times, yes, catchy -- songs that ring just a bit too hollow compared to the urgent leave-it-all-on-the-floor guts of those earliest releases [...] despite the polished and punchy singalong choruses, This Addiction is really just more of the same recycled melodies from the Trio rather than any sort of rebirth.\" Andrew Kelham of Rock Sound agreed that the album did not succeed in recapturing the band's early sound, but was a strong effort nonetheless: \"Alkaline Trio aren't na\u00efve punk rockers from the Chicago suburbs anymore, as a result this album fails to recapture that innocence but succeeds in creating another strong body of work that the group can be proud of.\" Mikael Wood of Spin remarked that the \"cozier confines\" of an independent label \"appear to have put the band at ease\" and that their \"hooky, blood-soaked bad-love allegories [...] satisfy like heartburn-inducing comfort food.\" French concluded that \"This Addiction isn't so much a 'return to form,' but rather a summary--a sonic scrapbook of sorts that carefully documents their entire career, from sour home Chicago to the dressing rooms of Late Night with Conan O'Brien''.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Mitr Phol sugar business was established as a small family business in Ban Pong District, Ratchaburi Province, producing and trading condensed syrup to sugar mills in 1946. In 1956, the company began to produce its own sugar. In 1983, Mitr Phu Kieo Sugar Mill was constructed in Phu Khiao District, Chaiyaphum Province, with a sugarcane processing capacity of 27,000 tonnes per day. In 1990, Mitr Phol Sugar Mill in Suphanburi Province was established with a processing capacity of 45,500 tonnes per day. The company expanded its business internationally in 1993 to Guangxi Province, China with four mills. Mitr Phol owns seven sugar mills in Guangxi and with an annual capacity of approximately 10 million tonnes of cane, or approximately 1.3 million tonnes of sugar per year. In 1994, Mitr Phol Sugar Mill (Suphanburi Province) was the first mill in Thailand certified by ISO 9002 and has been recognized with a National Certificate of Excellence and Global Standards. In 1995, Mitr Phol took over a sugar company in Phu Wiang District, Khon Kaen Province and named it Mitr Phol Phu Wiang Sugar Mill. In 1997, Mitr Phol constructed a sugar mill in Hai Tung County, China. Later in the same year, Mitr Kalasin Sugar Mill was established, in Kuchinarai District, Kalasin Province, with a processing capacity of 23,000 tonnes per day. In 2006, Mitr Phol broadened its production to Savannakhet Province, Laos and established Mitr Lao Sugar Co., Ltd. to develop sugarcane farming with advanced production technology to export to the European Union. Mitr Phol further expanded its investments to Queensland, Australia.\n\nParagraph 4: Dating to the 15th century, it has been in ruins since at least 1657 when it was described as \"only old walls\". The church and graveyard are set in a very prominent position at the North end of a ridge. The graveyard is a substantial earthwork, now rectangular in plan, 52m E-W x 42m N-S. The East gable of the church stands to the original height, while the West gable is reduced to foundations. A cross slab of Early Christian type from the site is now built into the gable of the porch of the Catholic church in Chapeltown nearby \n\nParagraph 5: Rudolph Walker was born on 28 September 1939 in San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago. He began acting as an eight-year-old in primary school, going on to join Derek Walcott's Trinidad Theatre Workshop as its youngest member. With the aim of furthering his career he left the island at the age of 20 in 1960. He had been planning to go to the United States, where he had connections, but actor Errol John \u2014 who had already migrated to Britain but was in Trinidad doing a play \u2014 convinced him to go to the UK, where the training was considered to be superior.\n\nParagraph 6: The outside of the structure is an example of Italian medieval architecture with Gothic influences. The lower story is stone while the upper crenellated stories are made of brick.  The facade of the palace is curved slightly inwards (concave) to reflect the outwards curve (convex) of the Piazza del Campo, Siena's central square, of which the Palace is the focal point. At the top of this facade is a huge round flat bronze plate [Christogram], the symbol used by Saint Bernardino. It was placed there by the government in 1425 in gratitude to the great preacher, a native Sienese, for his sermons aimed at quelling social and political factionalism and unrest.\n\nParagraph 7: Rudolph Walker was born on 28 September 1939 in San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago.

But, because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them, therefore they are to be translated in to the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that, the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner; and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.\u201dPursuant to the principles laid down in Overtoun that the question of whether a certain doctrine is in accord with the fundamental doctrines of a religious institution is purely a question of construction, the Court of Appeal went on to hold that (i) \u201cthe VPP doctrine is actually closely related to the VPI doctrine which both parties [i.e., FEBC and the Church] adhere to,\u201d (rejecting the Church's contention in [59] of the Court of Appeal Judgement that it is \u201can entirely different creature from the VPI doctrine\");\u201d(ii) \u201cthe College, in adopting the VPP doctrine, has not deviated from the fundamental principles which guide and inform the work of the College right from its inception, and as expressed in the Westminster Confession\u201d; (iii) [i]t is not inconsistent for a Christian who believes fully in the principles contained within the Westminster Confession (and the VPI [Verbal Plenary Inspiration] doctrine) to also subscribe to the VPP doctrine\u201d; and (iv) \u201c[i]n the absence of anything in the Westminster Confession that deals with the status of the apographs, we [the Judges of Appeal] hesitate to find that the VPP doctrine is a deviation from the principles contained within the Westminster Confession.\u201d\n\nParagraph 9: Phaneuf set a Flames record for most goals by a first-year defenceman and was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in 2005\u201306. Two years later, he was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman. During his career, Phaneuf was involved in two blockbuster trades. The first came in late 2009, when he was involved in a seven-player trade that saw him move from Calgary to Toronto. Six years later, Phaneuf was the centrepiece of a nine-player trade that saw him sent to Ottawa. He was traded to Los Angeles nearing the trade deadline in February 2018.\n\nParagraph 10: Foreign relations between neighbouring countries Australia and New Zealand, also referred to as Trans-Tasman relations, are extremely close. Both countries share a British colonial heritage as antipodean Dominions and settler colonies, and both are part of the core Anglosphere. New Zealand sent representatives to the constitutional conventions which led to the uniting of the six Australian colonies but opted not to join. In the Boer War and in both world wars, New Zealand soldiers fought alongside Australian soldiers. In recent years the Closer Economic Relations free trade agreement and its predecessors have inspired ever-converging economic integration. Despite some shared similarities, the cultures of Australia and New Zealand also have their own sets of differences and there are sometimes differences of opinion which some have declared as symptomatic of sibling rivalry. This often centres upon sports and in commercio-economic tensions, such as those arising from the failure of Ansett Australia and those engendered by the formerly long-standing Australian ban on New Zealand apple imports.\n\nParagraph 11: Phaneuf set a Flames record for most goals by a first-year defenceman and was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in 2005\u201306.

She is described in the T\u00e9l\u00e9toon profile as the best friend character, affectionate and not afraid to show her feelings. She enjoys sports and athletics but also shares her friends' fashion interests. She is the most naive and absent-minded of the three, sometimes interpreting figures of speech literally, often thinking it was actually going dark just because something is blocking her sight, or picking up and eating foodstuff at crime scenes that is potentially harmful. In the episode \"Do You Believe In Magic\", it is revealed Alex is the youngest of the three girls (and Clover the oldest). Her driving ability becomes a running gag in some episodes, despite the fact that she keeps getting to take the wheel and proves to be capable of improvising dangerous car stunts. She is sensitive and sometimes gets down on herself. Starting with season 3, Alex reveals interests in Taekwondo, skateboarding, soccer and video games. Alex appears to be racially mixed at first, having a dark-skinned mother and a white father in the season 4 episode \"Alex Gets Schooled\"; however, her father later appears with a completely different physical appearance, notably with dark skin in the season 6 episode \"Evil Ice Skater\". In Totally Spies! The Movie, which takes place when the girls first transfer to Beverly Hills High, she adopts a piglet whom she names  (), who does not appear in seasons 1-5 but recurs in season 6 when the girls have already gone to college. Although Alex says she is allergic to cats in season 1 episode \"Wild Style\", in \"Evil Mascot\", she handles Sigmund Smith's stray kitten without any allergic reaction, and she later works in a university cat lab in season 6 episode \"Nine Lives\" without problems. Like Sam and Clover, her last name has never been revealed but in \"Evil Ice Skater,\" Jerry refers to her father as \"Dr. Casoy\" but it's unknown if that's Alex's last name or not. \n\nParagraph 13: The porae has a body which is compressed and moderately short and deep, its depth being around two fifths of its standard length, with a very thin caudal peduncle. It has a moderately sized head which has a shallow dorsal profile and there is a small over the eyes in adults. There are no bony protuberances on the snout or to the front of the moderately sized eyes. It has a small mouth, which does not extend as far as the eyes, with thick and fleshy lips. The teeth are small and pointed and arranged in a single row in each jaw and they are embedded in the lips. There is a patch of smaller teeth to the rear of the main row in the front of the upper jaw. The dorsal fin is continuous, with a long base and only slight demarcation between the spiny part and the soft rayed part which are both of similar length. The spiny part is tallest at the front and decreases in height to the rear while the soft rayed part is of a uniform low height. The anal fin is similar in shape but slightly shorter than soft rayed part of the dorsal fin. The caudal fin is forked with the tips of both lobes bluntly pointed. The pectoral fins are of moderate size with its upper rays branched and its lower rays simple and robust with uppermost of these rays being highly elongated, extending almost to the middle of the anal fin. The pelvic fins are small and are placed obviously under and to the rear of the origin of the pectoral fins. The spiny part of the dorsal fin contains 17-18 spines while the soft rayed part holds 27-28 fin rays, the anal fin has 3 spines and 16-17 soft rays. This species attains a maximum fork length of  and a maximum published weight of . The overall colour is silvery, tinged with greenish-blue. or occasionally yellowish dorsally, paler silvery on the lower body. The fins may show a bluish tinge. The juveniles have a dark blotch just below middle of the lateral line, this fades as the fish grows.\n\nParagraph 14: Zell was born at Hanau am Main, date unknown.

Goh Chok Tong, who would eventually become Prime Minister in 1990, argued in Parliament that Town Councils not only provided for greater resident participation, but also would act as \"political stabilisers\". He cited the fact that in other democracies, e.g. Britain, there were inherent factors that resulted in greater political stability, such as long-term allegiances of constituencies to a certain political party. But in Singapore, ... it is the PAP which provides the political stability.  There is no other party at present which can effectively govern Singapore.  But this political stability can be threatened by sudden temporary swings in national mood.  If there are such swings, the PAP can be out of power.  If that happens, political instability will result because no alternative leadership has emerged which can effectively govern Singapore. Goh also noted in the same speech in Parliament that voters were confident that after decades of uninterrupted PAP rule, that even if they elected Opposition candidates to Parliament that they would still have a competent PAP Government managing their constituencies, which would result in a \"free-rider\" problem: For example, some voters who want a PAP Government also want to see some Opposition MPs. They may vote for an Opposition candidate and depend on the PAP to look after their constituency because they expect other constituencies to return PAP candidates in sufficient numbers to form the government. Chiam See Tong, the MP for Potong Pasir and one of only two non-PAP MPs at that time, spoke at length rejecting the bill. Chiam argued that the role of an MP was to give direction to a nation, and not to manage municipal matters:A party is elected because of its policy. The people may want the party to represent them so that the nation can move in a particular direction.  The PAP first came into power on a socialist platform.  People of Singapore voted them in because they thought that was good for Singapore and so they went on a socialist principle, up to lately, of course.  Some people may want to vote people like Margaret Thatcher, free enterprise, the capitalist line.  You vote her in.  So that is the purpose of voting Members of Parliament and a particular party.  But you do not vote a Town Councillor to change the direction or have a national policy in regard whether to foreign policy or to national policies on education or defence, or how you should have a relationship with your neighbours.  These are not the work of town councillors.  These are the work of Members of Parliament.  So there is a distinct different role.He also noted that most MPs did not stay in the same constituency, let alone the same housing estate, of their residents, and would therefore not add much value to the residents in such matters. He proposed that Town Councils should be made non-political, but was rebutted by Lee Hsien Loong that MPs should care for their constituents as much as they cared about lawmaking:If any MP stands in the next election and says, \"Please elect me. I will pay no attention to municipal matters. You go and find some non-political Town Councillor on your own to manage that and you have it out with HDB should anything happen\", I do not think he is going to be elected. I do not think the Member for Potong Pasir will put that in the SDP manifesto. Will he? Perhaps not.Ultimately, PAP's supermajority in Parliament allowed it to pass the bill into law without further consultation.\n\nParagraph 16: A 24-day players' strike was called after Week 2. The games that were scheduled for the third week of the season were cancelled, reducing the 16-game season to 15, but the games for Weeks 4, 5 and 6 were played with replacement players. The NFLPA actually ended the strike before the Week 6 slate of games, but the NFL owners' unanimously nixed their return that week because the union had missed an owner-mandated deadline that week to be eligible to return, and would have to wait until Week 7 to resume playing. Approximately 15% of the NFLPA\u2019s players chose to cross picket lines to play during the strike; prominent players who did so included New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Randy White, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, 49ers running back Roger Craig, New England Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent. The replacement players were mostly those left out of work by the recent folding of the Canadian Football League\u2019s Montreal Alouettes and the 1986 dissolution of the United States Football League, as well as others who had been preseason cuts, had long left professional football or were other assorted oddities (such as cinematographer Todd Schlopy, who, despite never playing professional football before or after the strike, served as placekicker for his hometown Buffalo Bills for three games). The replacement players, called to play on short notice and having little chance to gel as teammates, were widely treated with scorn by the press and general public, including name-calling, public shaming and accusations of being scabs. The games played by these replacement players were regarded with even less legitimacy \u2013 attendance plummeted to under 10,000 fans at many of the games in smaller markets and cities with strong union presence, including a low of 4,074 for the lone replacement game played in Philadelphia) \u2014 but nonetheless were counted as regular NFL games. Final television revenues were down by about 20%, a smaller drop than the networks had expected. The defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants went 0\u20133 in replacement games, ultimately costing them a chance to make the playoffs and to repeat their championship. The final replacement game was a Monday Night Football matchup on October 19, 1987, with the Washington Redskins at the Dallas Cowboys. Along with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Redskins were the only other NFL team not to have any players cross the picket line and were surprising 13\u20137 victors over the Cowboys who had plenty of big name players cross the picket line.\n\nParagraph 17: Mitr Phol sugar business was established as a small family business in Ban Pong District, Ratchaburi Province, producing and trading condensed syrup to sugar mills in 1946. In 1956, the company began to produce its own sugar. In 1983, Mitr Phu Kieo Sugar Mill was constructed in Phu Khiao District, Chaiyaphum Province, with a sugarcane processing capacity of 27,000 tonnes per day. In 1990, Mitr Phol Sugar Mill in Suphanburi Province was established with a processing capacity of 45,500 tonnes per day. The company expanded its business internationally in 1993 to Guangxi Province, China with four mills. Mitr Phol owns seven sugar mills in Guangxi and with an annual capacity of approximately 10 million tonnes of cane, or approximately 1.3 million tonnes of sugar per year. In 1994, Mitr Phol Sugar Mill (Suphanburi Province) was the first mill in Thailand certified by ISO 9002 and has been recognized with a National Certificate of Excellence and Global Standards. In 1995, Mitr Phol took over a sugar company in Phu Wiang District, Khon Kaen Province and named it Mitr Phol Phu Wiang Sugar Mill. In 1997, Mitr Phol constructed a sugar mill in Hai Tung County, China. Later in the same year, Mitr Kalasin Sugar Mill was established, in Kuchinarai District, Kalasin Province, with a processing capacity of 23,000 tonnes per day. In 2006, Mitr Phol broadened its production to Savannakhet Province, Laos and established Mitr Lao Sugar Co., Ltd. to develop sugarcane farming with advanced production technology to export to the European Union. Mitr Phol further expanded its investments to Queensland, Australia.\n\nParagraph 18: Phaneuf set a Flames record for most goals by a first-year defenceman and was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in 2005\u201306. Two years later, he was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman. During his career, Phaneuf was involved in two blockbuster trades. The first came in late 2009, when he was involved in a seven-player trade that saw him move from Calgary to Toronto. Six years later, Phaneuf was the centrepiece of a nine-player trade that saw him sent to Ottawa. He was traded to Los Angeles nearing the trade deadline in February 2018.\n\nParagraph 19: The Alhambra Decree (also known as the Edict of Expulsion; Spanish: Decreto de la Alhambra, Edicto de Granada) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) ordering the expulsion of practising Jews from the Crowns of Castile and Aragon and its territories and possessions by 31 July of that year. The primary purpose was to eliminate the influence of practising Jews on Spain's large formerly-Jewish converso New Christian population, to ensure the latter and their descendants did not revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jews had converted as a result of the religious persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391. Due to continuing attacks, around 50,000 more had converted by 1415. A further number of those remaining chose to convert to avoid expulsion. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in the years leading up to the expulsion, of Spain's estimated 300,000 Jewish origin population, a total of over 200,000 had converted to Catholicism to remain in Spain, and between 40,000 and 100,000 remained Jewish and suffered expulsion. An unknown number of the expelled eventually succumbed to the pressures of life in exile away from formerly-Jewish relatives and networks back in Spain, and so converted to Catholicism to be allowed to return in the years following expulsion.:17\n\nParagraph 20: For their first match of Stage 4, which would include the implementation of an enforced 2-2-2 role lock by the league, the Titans faced the Dragons in a rematch of the Stage 3 Semifinals; Vancouver took their revenge and won the match 3\u20131. Three days later, the team took on the Florida Mayhem. Vancouver's DPS Kim \"Haksal\" Hyo-jong on Genji dominated throughout the match, as he amassed 27 Dragonblade kills during the match to set an Overwatch League record for most Dragonblade kills per 10 minutes, and the Titans went on to sweep the Mayhem 4\u20130. The following week, the Titans faced the Washington Justice. Justice's DPS Corey \"Corey\" Nigra led the Justice throughout the match, as he broke the Overwatch League record for critical hit accuracy on Hanzo; in a major upset, the Justice handed the Titans their first-ever 0\u20134 loss and only their second loss in the entire regular season. The team took on the London Spitfire on August 8 for their first match of week three. While the Spitfire took map one Busan, the Titans came right back with their own win on map two Temple of Anubis to tie up the series. The teams split the next to maps to push the match into a fifth tiebreaker map; Vancouver edged out London on Ilios and won the match 3\u20132. The team's next match was against the Philadelphia Fusion three days later; the Titans took a clean 4\u20130 win. For their final week of play, the Titans headed to The Novo in Los Angeles to play in the Kit Kat Rivalry Weekend, hosted by the Los Angeles Valiant. Vancouver's first match of the weekend was against the San Francisco Shock on August 24. It was the fourth meeting between the two teams in the 2019 season, and the Titans held a 2\u20131 head-to-head record over the Shock. After dismantling the Shock on Lijiang Tower, Vancouver fell on Volskaya Industries. The two teams traded wins on maps three and four, pushing the match to a fifth tiebreaker match; the Titans were dominated on map five, leading to a 2\u20133 match loss. The team's final match of the regular season was against the Atlantic Division Champions New York Excelsior a day later. The two teams traded map wins throughout the match; after four maps the series was tied, forcing the match to a fifth map. Vancouver and New York both took a point in the final map, Lijiang Tower, but the Titans came out on top close out the regular season with a 3\u20132 match victory.\n\nParagraph 21: Dating to the 15th century, it has been in ruins since at least 1657 when it was described as \"only old walls\". The church and graveyard are set in a very prominent position at the North end of a ridge. The graveyard is a substantial earthwork, now rectangular in plan, 52m E-W x 42m N-S. The East gable of the church stands to the original height, while the West gable is reduced to foundations. A cross slab of Early Christian type from the site is now built into the gable of the porch of the Catholic church in Chapeltown nearby \n\nParagraph 22:  Long-term interest rates (average yields for 10yr government bonds in the past year): Shall be no more than 2.0 percentage points higher than the unweighted arithmetic average of the similar 10-year government bond yields in the 3 EU member states with the lowest HICP inflation (having qualified as benchmark countries for the calculation of the HICP reference value). If any of the 3 EU member states in concern are suffering from interest rates significantly higher than the \"GDP-weighted eurozone average interest rate\", and at the same time by the end of the assessment period have no complete funding access to the financial lending markets (which will be the case for as long as a country is unable to issue new government bonds with 10-year maturity \u2013 instead being dependent on disbursements from a sovereign state bailout programme), then such a country will not qualify as a benchmark country for the reference value; which then only will be calculated upon data from fewer than 3 EU member states. In example, Ireland was found to be an interest rate outlier not qualifying for the reference value calculation in the assessment month March 2012, when it was measured to have a long-term interest rate average being 4.71 percentage points above the eurozone average \u2013 while at the same time having no complete access to the financial lending markets. When Ireland was assessed again in April 2013, it was, however, deemed no longer to be an outlier, due to posting a long-term interest rate average only 1.59 percentage points above the eurozone average \u2013 while also having regained complete access to the financial lending markets for the last 1.5 month of the assessment period. A final relevant example appeared in April 2014, when Portugal likewise was found not to be an interest rate outlier, due to posting a long-term interest rate average being 2.89 percentage points above the eurozone average \u2013 while having regained complete access to the financial lending markets for the last 12 months of the assessment period.\n\nParagraph 23: Also for reasons of historical verisimilitude, factions, provinces on the campaign map and factions' family members have been given vernacular names in Europa Barbarorum, rather than having Latinised or Anglicised ones, as in Rome: Total War. So, for instance, the original game's Armenia faction is known as Hayasdan in Europa Barbarorum, and Germania as the Sweboz. Instead of having to play one's first campaign as a Roman faction and only subsequently unlock playable campaigns as non-Romans by defeating them in the Roman campaign, all twenty of Europa Barbarorums playable factions can be accessed by the player from the start. Furthermore, the one unplayable and three playable Roman factions of the original have been combined into a single playable faction in Europa Barbarorum, the Romani. Dissatisfied with the homogeneity of the factions of the original Rome: Total War, the Europa Barbarorum development team have sought to differentiate the playing experiences of the game's different factions. So, for example, Rome: Total Wars trait-acquisition system, where the player's faction's family members acquire certain characteristics and talents which make them more or less adept at certain tasks such as city management or military leadership, has been made more faction-specific in Europa Barbarorum, with Hellenic characters' traits, for instance, being based on Theophrastos' Characters and Aristotle's teachings on the Golden Mean, and Romans' traits being partially based on the moral tales of Valerius Maximus. There are sometimes additional requirements for a family member to be able to gain a new trait: in order for them to compete in one of the Panhellenic Games, for instance, the player must ensure that they are stationed in the appropriate city on the campaign map in the year that the competition is scheduled to take place. One reviewer has commented that Europa Barbarorums expansions upon the original Rome: Total Wars trait system have served to add a role-playing element to the game.\n\nParagraph 24: Dating to the 15th century, it has been in ruins since at least 1657 when it was described as \"only old walls\".

In the mid 1400s it was used to create the Pope Alexander VII Dioscorides, now in the Vatican Library, by the monks of St. John the Baptist Greek orthodox monastery in Constantinople. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 a subsequent owner handwrote each plant's name in Arabic and Hebrew. The manuscript, still in Istanbul a century after the fall of the city, was purchased from Moses Hamon, the Arabic-speaking, Jewish physician to sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, by the Flemish diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, who was in the employ of Emperor Ferdinand I of the Austrian Habsburgs. The manuscript is now held among the manuscripts of the Austrian National Library () in Vienna, where it is identified as the Codex Vindobonensis med. gr. 1. The manuscript was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 1997 in recognition of its historical significance.\n\nParagraph 26: Also for reasons of historical verisimilitude, factions, provinces on the campaign map and factions' family members have been given vernacular names in Europa Barbarorum, rather than having Latinised or Anglicised ones, as in Rome: Total War.

The lower story is stone while the upper crenellated stories are made of brick.  The facade of the palace is curved slightly inwards (concave) to reflect the outwards curve (convex) of the Piazza del Campo, Siena's central square, of which the Palace is the focal point. At the top of this facade is a huge round flat bronze plate [Christogram], the symbol used by Saint Bernardino. It was placed there by the government in 1425 in gratitude to the great preacher, a native Sienese, for his sermons aimed at quelling social and political factionalism and unrest.\n\nParagraph 30: Dating to the 15th century, it has been in ruins since at least 1657 when it was described as \"only old walls\".

Species-specific defence reactions are innate responses demonstrated by an animal when they experience a threat. Since survival behaviours are so vital for an animal to acquire and demonstrate rapidly, it has been theorized that these defence reactions would not have time to be learned and therefore, must be innate. While these behaviours are species-specific, there are three general categories of defence reactions - fleeing, freezing, and threatening. Species-specific defence reactions are now recognized as being organized in a hierarchical system where different behaviours are exhibited, depending on the level of threat experienced. However, when this concept was first proposed, the dominant species-specific defence reaction in a certain context was thought to be controlled by operant conditioning. That is, if a species-specific defence reaction was unsuccessful in evading or controlling conflict, the hierarchical system would be rearranged because of the punishment, in the form of failure, experienced by an animal. It would then be unlikely for that species-specific defence reaction to be used in a similar situation again; instead, an alternative behaviour would be dominant. However, if the dominant behaviour was successful it would remain the recurring behaviour for that situation. After experimentation, this theory was met with much opposition, even by the person who proposed it. One point of opposition was found through the use of shock on rats and the species-specific defence reaction of freezing. This experiment found that while punishment did seem to affect freezing, it was not through response weakening but through the evoking of different levels of the behaviour. Other criticisms for this theory focused on the inability for species-specific defence reactions to effectively rearrange in this manner in natural situations. It has been argued that there would not be enough time for punishment, in the form of an animal being unsuccessful in its defence, to reorder the hierarchy of species-specific defence reactions. The rejection of the operant conditioning mechanism for the reorganization of species-specific defence reactions, led to the development of the predatory imminence continuum. The organization of defensive behaviours can be attributed to the level of threat an animal perceives itself to be in. This theory is one of adaptiveness, as the dominant defence reaction is the behaviour which is most effective in allowing the survival of the animal and the one which is most effective in preventing an increasing level of threat, also known as increasing imminence. The probability of being killed by a predator, known as predatory imminence, is what is responsible for the expressed defensive behaviour. The predatory imminence is dependent on many factors such as the distance from a predator, the potential for escape, and the likelihood of meeting a predator. Three general categories of defensive behaviours, based on increasing predatory imminence, have been identified. These are labelled as pre-encounter, post-encounter, and circa-strike defensive behaviours.\n\nParagraph 32: Mitr Phol sugar business was established as a small family business in Ban Pong District, Ratchaburi Province, producing and trading condensed syrup to sugar mills in 1946.

Irfan and Sameera become best friends from enemies, and Sagar and Sameera are in a relationship. Rekha, childhood friend of Sagar, loves Sagar and Sagar's brother Rahul is a close ally of James. As Rekha is rich, Rahul and Sagar's mother want to marry Rekha to Sagar. Sagar, jealous of the growing friendship between Sammera and Irfan, badly beats her up and tries to rape her, and while escaping she falls down a flight of stairs and her leg is broken.

Jagan and Sameera get married and Chakravam comes to a happy end.\n\nParagraph 36: The  Kaj Strand Telescope (or Kaj Strand Astrometric Reflector, KSAR) remains the largest telescope operated by the U.S. Navy. Congress appropriated funding in 1961 and it saw first light in 1964. This status will change when the NPOI four 1.8-meter telescopes see their own first light in the near future. KSAR rides in the arms of an equatorial fork mount. The telescope is used in both the visible spectrum, and in the near infrared (NIR), the latter using a sub-30-kelvin, helium-refrigerated, InSb (Indium antimonide) camera, \"Astrocam\". In 1978, the 1.55-m telescope was used to \"discover the moon of dwarf planet Pluto, named 'Charon'\". (Pluto itself was discovered in 1930, across town at Lowell Observatory). The Charon discovery led to mass calculations which ultimately revealed how tiny Pluto was, and eventually caused the IAU to reclassify Pluto as a dwarf (not a principal) planet. The 1.55-meter telescope was also used to observe and track NASA's Deep Impact Spacecraft, as it navigated to a successful inter-planetary impact with the celebrated Comet 9p/Tempel, in 2005. This telescope is particularly well-suited to perform stellar parallax studies, narrow-field astrometry supporting space navigation, and has also played a key role in discovering one of the coolest-ever known brown dwarf objects, in 2002. The KSAR dome is centrally located on NOFS grounds, with support and office buildings attached to the dome structures. The large vacuum coating chamber facility is also located in this complex. The chamber can provide very accurate coatings and overcoatings of  Angstrom thickness (approximately 56 aluminium atoms thick), for small-to-multi-ton optics up to  in diameter, in a vacuum exceeding , using a vertical-optic, 1500-ampere discharge system. A dielectric coating capability has also been demonstrated. Large optics and telescope components can be moved about NOFS using its suite of cranes, lifts, cargo elevators and specialized carts. The main complex also contains a controlled-environment, optical and electronics lab for laser, adaptive optics, optics development, collimation, mechanical, and micro-electronic control systems needed for NOFS and NPOI.\n\nParagraph 37: Alexandra has short black hair, light brown eyes, and dark skin; she dons a yellow catsuit on missions. She is described in the T\u00e9l\u00e9toon profile as the best friend character, affectionate and not afraid to show her feelings. She enjoys sports and athletics but also shares her friends' fashion interests. She is the most naive and absent-minded of the three, sometimes interpreting figures of speech literally, often thinking it was actually going dark just because something is blocking her sight, or picking up and eating foodstuff at crime scenes that is potentially harmful. In the episode \"Do You Believe In Magic\", it is revealed Alex is the youngest of the three girls (and Clover the oldest). Her driving ability becomes a running gag in some episodes, despite the fact that she keeps getting to take the wheel and proves to be capable of improvising dangerous car stunts. She is sensitive and sometimes gets down on herself. Starting with season 3, Alex reveals interests in Taekwondo, skateboarding, soccer and video games. Alex appears to be racially mixed at first, having a dark-skinned mother and a white father in the season 4 episode \"Alex Gets Schooled\"; however, her father later appears with a completely different physical appearance, notably with dark skin in the season 6 episode \"Evil Ice Skater\". In Totally Spies! The Movie, which takes place when the girls first transfer to Beverly Hills High, she adopts a piglet whom she names  (), who does not appear in seasons 1-5 but recurs in season 6 when the girls have already gone to college. Although Alex says she is allergic to cats in season 1 episode \"Wild Style\", in \"Evil Mascot\", she handles Sigmund Smith's stray kitten without any allergic reaction, and she later works in a university cat lab in season 6 episode \"Nine Lives\" without problems. Like Sam and Clover, her last name has never been revealed but in \"Evil Ice Skater,\" Jerry refers to her father as \"Dr. Casoy\" but it's unknown if that's Alex's last name or not. \n\nParagraph 38: It is useful to keep in mind that although the waves traverse the entire expansion chamber over each cycle, the actual gases leaving the cylinder during a particular cycle do not. The gas flows and stops intermittently and the wave continues on to the end of the pipe. The hot gases leaving the port form a \"slug\" which fills the header pipe and remains there for the duration of that cycle. This causes a high temperature zone in the head pipe which is always filled with the most recent and hottest gas. Because this area is hotter, the speed of sound and thus the speed of the waves that travel through it are increased. During the next cycle that slug of gas will be pushed down the pipe by the next slug to occupy the next zone and so on. The volume this \"slug\" occupies constantly varies according to throttle position and engine speed. It is only the wave energy itself that traverses the whole pipe during a single cycle. The actual gas leaving the pipe during a particular cycle was created two or three cycles earlier. This is why exhaust gas sampling on two stroke engines is done with a special valve right in the exhaust port. The gas exiting the stinger has had too much resident time and mixing with gas from other cycles causing errors in analysis.\n\nParagraph 39: A 24-day players' strike was called after Week 2. The games that were scheduled for the third week of the season were cancelled, reducing the 16-game season to 15, but the games for Weeks 4, 5 and 6 were played with replacement players. The NFLPA actually ended the strike before the Week 6 slate of games, but the NFL owners' unanimously nixed their return that week because the union had missed an owner-mandated deadline that week to be eligible to return, and would have to wait until Week 7 to resume playing. Approximately 15% of the NFLPA\u2019s players chose to cross picket lines to play during the strike; prominent players who did so included New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Randy White, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, 49ers running back Roger Craig, New England Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent. The replacement players were mostly those left out of work by the recent folding of the Canadian Football League\u2019s Montreal Alouettes and the 1986 dissolution of the United States Football League, as well as others who had been preseason cuts, had long left professional football or were other assorted oddities (such as cinematographer Todd Schlopy, who, despite never playing professional football before or after the strike, served as placekicker for his hometown Buffalo Bills for three games). The replacement players, called to play on short notice and having little chance to gel as teammates, were widely treated with scorn by the press and general public, including name-calling, public shaming and accusations of being scabs. The games played by these replacement players were regarded with even less legitimacy \u2013 attendance plummeted to under 10,000 fans at many of the games in smaller markets and cities with strong union presence, including a low of 4,074 for the lone replacement game played in Philadelphia) \u2014 but nonetheless were counted as regular NFL games. Final television revenues were down by about 20%, a smaller drop than the networks had expected. The defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants went 0\u20133 in replacement games, ultimately costing them a chance to make the playoffs and to repeat their championship. The final replacement game was a Monday Night Football matchup on October 19, 1987, with the Washington Redskins at the Dallas Cowboys. Along with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Redskins were the only other NFL team not to have any players cross the picket line and were surprising 13\u20137 victors over the Cowboys who had plenty of big name players cross the picket line.\n\nParagraph 40: Sameera comes to India and lives with Raghavamma. Irfan and Sameera become best friends from enemies, and Sagar and Sameera are in a relationship. Rekha, childhood friend of Sagar, loves Sagar and Sagar's brother Rahul is a close ally of James. As Rekha is rich, Rahul and Sagar's mother want to marry Rekha to Sagar. Sagar, jealous of the growing friendship between Sammera and Irfan, badly beats her up and tries to rape her, and while escaping she falls down a flight of stairs and her leg is broken. Due to this, Sameera breaks off her marriage to Sagar. James frames Sameera falsely in a drug case and Sagar's family emotionally blackmail him into marrying Rekha. Irfan and Wilson help Sameera to get released from jail. Rekha tests HIV positive and everyone except Sagar, Rahul and Sameera shun her and illtreat her. Jagan comes to meet Wilson, threatens Sameera whole asking for Wilson and Sameera pushes him in self defense. Japan gets a head injury and forgets his past life.

Jagan and Sameera get married and Chakravam comes to a happy end.\n\nParagraph 41: Zell was born at Hanau am Main, date unknown. He learned the art of printing before 1462 in the printing establishment of Johann Fust and Peter Sch\u00f6ffer, and seems, shortly after the catastrophe of 1462, to have gone to Cologne, whose university gave promise of a market for printed works. Zell was printing at Cologne apparently as early as 1463, although his first dated book is 1466. His work as printer and publisher can be traced up to the year 1502; altogether about 120 of his publications are known. Of these, however, only nine bear his name, but in all probability he printed and published many more. In outline and cut his six kinds of type are strikingly similar to the \"Durandus\" and \"Clements\" types of Fust and Schoffer; it would even seem that a number of the matrices of the \"Clements\" type had been used. Most of the books printed by Zell were text-books in quarto form for the university. Among the fine productions of his printing shop is an undated edition of the Latin Bible in two volumes. At first he called himself clericus (of the lower orders), but as early as 1471 he married and became a citizen and householder of Cologne. In 1473 he bought the important manorial estate of \"Lyskirchen\", to which he transferred the main part of his business. In the colophons of his books the place of business is called \"apud Lyskirchen\". The purchase, sometime later, of various houses, lands, and properties yielding revenues, show that Zell had become a prosperous man. It is also proof of his importance that for a long time he filled the office of Kirchenmeister (church-master) of \"S. Maria an Lyskirchen\". Of much importance in the history of the discovery of printing is Zell's statement, preserved in the Chronicle of Cologne of 1499, that the year 1450 was the date of the beginning of printing, that the country-squire Johann Gutenberg was the inventor of it, and that the first book printed was the Latin Bible, the Vulgate.\n\nParagraph 42: A 24-day players' strike was called after Week 2.
