{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\nMarketing: Oh , okay ,\nUser Interface: No , I don't think so .\nMarketing: I think it's a technical thing\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: which our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and those waves have high {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nUser Interface: Twenty five . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: but we have to take this into account .\nUser Interface: Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: So anyway\nUser Interface: One of us {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\nUser Interface: Functions .\nMarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\nProject Manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\nMarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay .\nMarketing: this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .\nUser Interface: I got one question ,\nMarketing: I can go back .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nMarketing: Yeah one question ,\nUser Interface: uh you are a Market Expert\nMarketing: yeah ?\nUser Interface: so\nMarketing: I am . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: should we aim at the young people or not ?\nMarketing: I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , then teletext is used less .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: That's good point .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yep .\nUser Interface: Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: 'Kay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Of the technical function , so {vocalsound} uh\nMarketing: So I think it's you , huh ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's\nMarketing: No ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} That's me .\nProject Manager: what effect {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: techni function of {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , user requiremen\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . Wait a second .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Argh .\nIndustrial Designer: I have to do working design so uh\nProject Manager: So you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's {disfmarker} but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\nProject Manager: Okay . Let's go .\nUser Interface: So next slide please . And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\nMarketing: Makes sense . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: which one would you prefer ? I guess this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\nUser Interface: Sure , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like , between those two\nUser Interface: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple\nIndustrial Designer: li\nProject Manager: Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: simple desires into simple actions .\nMarketing: Nice . Nice sentence .\nUser Interface: Findings .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh sorry .\nUser Interface: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a really good style , it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So {disfmarker} Press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: It's off .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: It's on .\nUser Interface: the T_V_ turns on .\nMarketing: And when does it turn off ?\nUser Interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the {disfmarker} For for enough time\nMarketing: Oh so you have a\nUser Interface: like uh you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: sensing {disfmarker} sensor machine that uh knows {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's a question to our technical design , our {vocalsound} two engineers .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\nProject Manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's easy to do ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: you just control the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: According to your distance to {disfmarker} and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\nIndustrial Designer: Distance .\nUser Interface: According to the distance . {gap} Yeah yeah yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\nUser Interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . {gap}\nUser Interface: So , its main purpose in fact is a back light ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: which change colours ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: which makes it easier to find , and each can {disfmarker} it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: So basically that's it .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\nUser Interface: Can be easily done ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Just few actions , a few actions for everything .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . S\nUser Interface: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\nProject Manager: Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah and it {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: Okay , but it's quite universal you know .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: We can just extend it to any device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So for instance if I want to go to {disfmarker} directly to channel twenty five , how would I do {disfmarker} can I do that with this ?\nUser Interface: Uh twenty five .\nMarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact I would propose another solution .\nMarketing: Or is it ?\nUser Interface: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ?\nMarketing: Most people {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\nMarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: B yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number\nMarketing: Go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: and then it go\nMarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\nIndustrial Designer: t because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But still {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .\nProject Manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And it's only next .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah\nUser Interface: Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\nMarketing: so {disfmarker} but you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah. .\nUser Interface: Or say this can be back .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press {disfmarker} suppose two five they just press two and five\nMarketing: So it would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and you can change mode {disfmarker} zapping mode or\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Alright .\nProject Manager: uh current chan\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Listening more .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\nMarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Although I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright ? Thanks for your attention .\nProject Manager: Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry .\nProject Manager: You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .\nProject Manager: Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nProject Manager: On {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so that we just use simple recog\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Too complex .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: no but but {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\nMarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And what about the price of this component ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\nProject Manager: It mm {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: Hmm . Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,\nMarketing: Millions . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so we can make really simp\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we want to make really simple device\nMarketing: Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .\nMarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\nIndustrial Designer: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm .\nIndustrial Designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nMarketing: Couple of words .\nIndustrial Designer: then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nMarketing: Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\nProject Manager: No , in no not only speech , yeah .\nMarketing: It's on top of using the button .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I it's an option .\nUser Interface: Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .\nMarketing: Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key .\nUser Interface: Okay. .\nIndustrial Designer: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nMarketing: T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sho to to train , okay .\nUser Interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: roll 'em up\nIndustrial Designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nUser Interface: or roll 'em down .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer: because it's it's very expensive\nMarketing: no ?\nIndustrial Designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nProject Manager: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm why ?\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: And volume control .\nIndustrial Designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nMarketing: So but uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Wouldn't that make uh {vocalsound} arguments ?\nIndustrial Designer: They can make {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the discussion about the working design of the remote control.\nAnswer:", "input": "Summarize the discussion about the working design of the remote control.", "context": "Project Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\nMarketing: Oh , okay ,\nUser Interface: No , I don't think so .\nMarketing: I think it's a technical thing\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: which our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and those waves have high {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nUser Interface: Twenty five . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: but we have to take this into account .\nUser Interface: Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: So anyway\nUser Interface: One of us {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\nUser Interface: Functions .\nMarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\nProject Manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\nMarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay .\nMarketing: this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .\nUser Interface: I got one question ,\nMarketing: I can go back .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nMarketing: Yeah one question ,\nUser Interface: uh you are a Market Expert\nMarketing: yeah ?\nUser Interface: so\nMarketing: I am . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: should we aim at the young people or not ?\nMarketing: I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , then teletext is used less .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: That's good point .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yep .\nUser Interface: Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: 'Kay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Of the technical function , so {vocalsound} uh\nMarketing: So I think it's you , huh ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's\nMarketing: No ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} That's me .\nProject Manager: what effect {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: techni function of {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , user requiremen\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . Wait a second .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Argh .\nIndustrial Designer: I have to do working design so uh\nProject Manager: So you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's {disfmarker} but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\nProject Manager: Okay . Let's go .\nUser Interface: So next slide please . And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\nMarketing: Makes sense . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: which one would you prefer ? I guess this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\nUser Interface: Sure , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like , between those two\nUser Interface: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple\nIndustrial Designer: li\nProject Manager: Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: simple desires into simple actions .\nMarketing: Nice . Nice sentence .\nUser Interface: Findings .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh sorry .\nUser Interface: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a really good style , it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So {disfmarker} Press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: It's off .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: It's on .\nUser Interface: the T_V_ turns on .\nMarketing: And when does it turn off ?\nUser Interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the {disfmarker} For for enough time\nMarketing: Oh so you have a\nUser Interface: like uh you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: sensing {disfmarker} sensor machine that uh knows {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's a question to our technical design , our {vocalsound} two engineers .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\nProject Manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's easy to do ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: you just control the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: According to your distance to {disfmarker} and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\nIndustrial Designer: Distance .\nUser Interface: According to the distance . {gap} Yeah yeah yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\nUser Interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . {gap}\nUser Interface: So , its main purpose in fact is a back light ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: which change colours ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: which makes it easier to find , and each can {disfmarker} it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: So basically that's it .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\nUser Interface: Can be easily done ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Just few actions , a few actions for everything .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . S\nUser Interface: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\nProject Manager: Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah and it {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: Okay , but it's quite universal you know .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: We can just extend it to any device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So for instance if I want to go to {disfmarker} directly to channel twenty five , how would I do {disfmarker} can I do that with this ?\nUser Interface: Uh twenty five .\nMarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact I would propose another solution .\nMarketing: Or is it ?\nUser Interface: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ?\nMarketing: Most people {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\nMarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: B yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number\nMarketing: Go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: and then it go\nMarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\nIndustrial Designer: t because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But still {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .\nProject Manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And it's only next .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah\nUser Interface: Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\nMarketing: so {disfmarker} but you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah. .\nUser Interface: Or say this can be back .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press {disfmarker} suppose two five they just press two and five\nMarketing: So it would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and you can change mode {disfmarker} zapping mode or\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Alright .\nProject Manager: uh current chan\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Listening more .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\nMarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Although I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright ? Thanks for your attention .\nProject Manager: Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry .\nProject Manager: You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .\nProject Manager: Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nProject Manager: On {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so that we just use simple recog\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Too complex .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: no but but {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\nMarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And what about the price of this component ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\nProject Manager: It mm {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: Hmm . Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,\nMarketing: Millions . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so we can make really simp\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we want to make really simple device\nMarketing: Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .\nMarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\nIndustrial Designer: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm .\nIndustrial Designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nMarketing: Couple of words .\nIndustrial Designer: then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nMarketing: Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\nProject Manager: No , in no not only speech , yeah .\nMarketing: It's on top of using the button .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I it's an option .\nUser Interface: Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .\nMarketing: Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key .\nUser Interface: Okay. .\nIndustrial Designer: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nMarketing: T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sho to to train , okay .\nUser Interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: roll 'em up\nIndustrial Designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nUser Interface: or roll 'em down .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer: because it's it's very expensive\nMarketing: no ?\nIndustrial Designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nProject Manager: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm why ?\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: And volume control .\nIndustrial Designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nMarketing: So but uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Wouldn't that make uh {vocalsound} arguments ?\nIndustrial Designer: They can make {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}", "answers": ["The industrial designer described the product as a portable device with some energy source, an interface which included some pressing buttons and keys, a processor, some infrared source which could send the information to the main device, and different encryption codes for different TVs. Since the Marketing and the user interface designer mentioned speech recognition, the industrial designer also took that into account. All these components would cost 5 Euros or even less than that. As for gesture recognition and automatic power control, the group gave them up due to price issues.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager: That's great .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: Perfect .\nProject Manager: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is {disfmarker} I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about {disfmarker} I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some {disfmarker} you know , say our {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind {disfmarker} before we launch {disfmarker} can we see how they're received ?\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker} It's an option , uh but actually there's {disfmarker} I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now\nProject Manager: Okay . Okay .\nMarketing: which actually might even come into play beforehand ,\nProject Manager: Okay , perfect .\nMarketing: it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .\nProject Manager: Great , thank you very much Nathan .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , you're welcome .\nProject Manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You waiting for me ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Fascinating , compelling even .\nMarketing: I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . {vocalsound} Right . So\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now {disfmarker} basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting {disfmarker} they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um {disfmarker} that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tomatoes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: a different shape\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or {vocalsound} okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of {disfmarker} and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I like it , I like it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: uh not something I I've come up with a {gap} though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use {disfmarker} we can use a rubber as part of the case ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Slick , slick .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nMarketing: Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new {disfmarker} I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager: Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's {disfmarker} tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause so many {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nIndustrial Designer: you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .\nMarketing: Very true . Very true .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's like , yep {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you ,\nMarketing: Very much so {vocalsound} . Um\nIndustrial Designer: you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .\nProject Manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it ?\nUser Interface: We can have a duck tape casing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We could .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It could go with the granola crowd .\nMarketing: but worth a shot .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , it could be , it could be ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Great ,\nMarketing: um . Yeah that's what I know .\nProject Manager: thanks for that Sarah .\nMarketing: No problem .\nProject Manager: Ron ?\nUser Interface: Phew . Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look .\nProject Manager: Yeah\nUser Interface: Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um {disfmarker} with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} On the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: at the {gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: right .\nMarketing: Yeah . Very true , very true .\nUser Interface: Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: which I am sure most of you know about .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern {gap} a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your {disfmarker} for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I {disfmarker} again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I can see . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , again probably not what we're going for\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so I {disfmarker} I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh {disfmarker} our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it\nMarketing: Mm , right .\nUser Interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: has jokes when it's ready .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager: Great .\nUser Interface: And uh that is about it .\nProject Manager: Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . {vocalsound} Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um {vocalsound} various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?\nMarketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . 'Kay .\nMarketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: right ?\nIndustrial Designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote ,\nProject Manager: To produce each one .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Per ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's just an estimate though .\nMarketing: Piece .\nUser Interface: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: You industrial designers . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I know .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's fun . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?\nProject Manager: Well .\nMarketing: Do we remember ?\nIndustrial Designer: I thought there was some flexibility with that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: There is , it's just , it is a question of {disfmarker} and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .\nMarketing: Can we justify it ?\nProject Manager: Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin {vocalsound} um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?\nIndustrial Designer: That's just off the top of my head ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} From the board ,\nIndustrial Designer: it is pending further emails . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: um , well {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's true , I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It is the new {disfmarker} it would be in a class of its own .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And that's {disfmarker} to be fair the um the per cent of the market {disfmarker} we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make {disfmarker} I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros ,\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh {disfmarker} on the third floor suggested that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: See if we can cut some corners .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's true .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right . It's a starting point anyway , so .\nProject Manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we {disfmarker} yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} our main selling point here .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition {disfmarker} I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} The voice rec thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , {vocalsound} if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec .\nMarketing: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house ,\nMarketing: Price-wise .\nUser Interface: I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: we're using it for our coffee machines already .\nMarketing: We've already got it .\nUser Interface: I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh {disfmarker} guy down the hall . Sounds good .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?\nIndustrial Designer: I think if we {disfmarker} we do both the {disfmarker} obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into {disfmarker} it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice .\nMarketing: Pretty much .\nUser Interface: I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .\nMarketing: Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Does having both really up our costs ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , 'cause you {disfmarker} you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .\nProject Manager: It's just impossible .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just {disfmarker} it just becomes cost prohibitive . What {disfmarker} which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?\nMarketing: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .\nIndustrial Designer: I would have to side with that ,\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the {disfmarker} all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well my p {vocalsound} is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nathan ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would {disfmarker} they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: we're not gonna have to do as much design work\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .\nProject Manager: Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment .\nMarketing: And we're still not {disfmarker} then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: we can stick with what we've already got . In a lot other ways too .\nProject Manager: Okay . So I'm getting {disfmarker} alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay .\nMarketing: I think it's our lower risk option\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: which for right now {disfmarker} we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .\nProject Manager: Okay . Sorted .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .\nUser Interface: It's you and me outside a little here . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's {disfmarker} you guys's next step right ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it {disfmarker} what {vocalsound} f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ?\nProject Manager: Yes . We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement ,\nProject Manager: Mm . Yep .\nMarketing: like what if {disfmarker} wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light ,\nUser Interface: Calculator .\nMarketing: Yeah . True . True .\nIndustrial Designer: um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: What do you think Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?\nUser Interface: Just a thought .\nIndustrial Designer: What's the uh idea ?\nUser Interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .\nMarketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Do you think people that are {disfmarker} people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .\nMarketing: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,\nProject Manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well .\nMarketing: right .\nProject Manager: But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have {disfmarker} or like um {vocalsound} who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well .\nMarketing: With the bu yeah .\nProject Manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , I think you're on to something\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is {disfmarker} would be good , even though {disfmarker} and hand-held the same time .\nMarketing: True . Way to go .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things .\nMarketing: Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: you know like that little pod looking thing ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , those are nice .\nUser Interface: Exactly .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I mean a nice {disfmarker} although we do um wh uh is {disfmarker} I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: and get back to it\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh {disfmarker} using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: um you know\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit {disfmarker} gives just a bit . You know\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Just kind of the squishy feel .\nMarketing: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it {disfmarker} literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good .\nMarketing: Handy .\nProject Manager: Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , {vocalsound} um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We'll have more of an idea when the prototype {disfmarker} have more of a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and I'm just having to guess .\nProject Manager: we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . {vocalsound} Um , so\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we {disfmarker} wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um {vocalsound} a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .\nMarketing: Mm . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Like maybe have menu things .\nMarketing: Take precedence ,\nIndustrial Designer: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out\nMarketing: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .\nMarketing: And they slide .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah\nMarketing: True ,\nProject Manager: we've also got the the me the thing of ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: we're still not making it easier then .\nProject Manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: B But no I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the group talk about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the group talk about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget?", "context": "Marketing: {vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager: That's great .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: Perfect .\nProject Manager: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll go first .\nProject Manager: Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing: Go ahead .\nProject Manager: take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface: Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is {disfmarker} I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about {disfmarker} I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some {disfmarker} you know , say our {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind {disfmarker} before we launch {disfmarker} can we see how they're received ?\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker} It's an option , uh but actually there's {disfmarker} I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now\nProject Manager: Okay . Okay .\nMarketing: which actually might even come into play beforehand ,\nProject Manager: Okay , perfect .\nMarketing: it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .\nProject Manager: Great , thank you very much Nathan .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah , you're welcome .\nProject Manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You waiting for me ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Fascinating , compelling even .\nMarketing: I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . {vocalsound} Right . So\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now {disfmarker} basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting {disfmarker} they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um {disfmarker} that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Tomatoes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: a different shape\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or {vocalsound} okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of {disfmarker} and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I like it , I like it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: uh not something I I've come up with a {gap} though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use {disfmarker} we can use a rubber as part of the case ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Slick , slick .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nMarketing: Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new {disfmarker} I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager: Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's {disfmarker} tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause so many {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nIndustrial Designer: you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .\nMarketing: Very true . Very true .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's like , yep {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you ,\nMarketing: Very much so {vocalsound} . Um\nIndustrial Designer: you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .\nProject Manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it ?\nUser Interface: We can have a duck tape casing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We could .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It could go with the granola crowd .\nMarketing: but worth a shot .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , it could be , it could be ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Great ,\nMarketing: um . Yeah that's what I know .\nProject Manager: thanks for that Sarah .\nMarketing: No problem .\nProject Manager: Ron ?\nUser Interface: Phew . Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look .\nProject Manager: Yeah\nUser Interface: Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um {disfmarker} with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} On the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: at the {gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: right .\nMarketing: Yeah . Very true , very true .\nUser Interface: Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: which I am sure most of you know about .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern {gap} a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your {disfmarker} for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I {disfmarker} again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I can see . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , again probably not what we're going for\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so I {disfmarker} I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh {disfmarker} our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it\nMarketing: Mm , right .\nUser Interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: has jokes when it's ready .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager: Great .\nUser Interface: And uh that is about it .\nProject Manager: Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . {vocalsound} Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um {vocalsound} various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?\nMarketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . 'Kay .\nMarketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: right ?\nIndustrial Designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote ,\nProject Manager: To produce each one .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Per ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah that's just an estimate though .\nMarketing: Piece .\nUser Interface: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: You industrial designers . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I know .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's fun . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?\nProject Manager: Well .\nMarketing: Do we remember ?\nIndustrial Designer: I thought there was some flexibility with that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: There is , it's just , it is a question of {disfmarker} and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .\nMarketing: Can we justify it ?\nProject Manager: Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin {vocalsound} um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?\nIndustrial Designer: That's just off the top of my head ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} From the board ,\nIndustrial Designer: it is pending further emails . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: um , well {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's true , I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It is the new {disfmarker} it would be in a class of its own .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And that's {disfmarker} to be fair the um the per cent of the market {disfmarker} we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make {disfmarker} I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros ,\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh {disfmarker} on the third floor suggested that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: See if we can cut some corners .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: It's true .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right . It's a starting point anyway , so .\nProject Manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we {disfmarker} yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} our main selling point here .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition {disfmarker} I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} The voice rec thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , {vocalsound} if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec .\nMarketing: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house ,\nMarketing: Price-wise .\nUser Interface: I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice {disfmarker}\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: we're using it for our coffee machines already .\nMarketing: We've already got it .\nUser Interface: I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh {disfmarker} guy down the hall . Sounds good .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?\nIndustrial Designer: I think if we {disfmarker} we do both the {disfmarker} obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into {disfmarker} it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice .\nMarketing: Pretty much .\nUser Interface: I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .\nMarketing: Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Does having both really up our costs ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , 'cause you {disfmarker} you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .\nProject Manager: It's just impossible .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just {disfmarker} it just becomes cost prohibitive . What {disfmarker} which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?\nMarketing: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .\nIndustrial Designer: I would have to side with that ,\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the {disfmarker} all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well my p {vocalsound} is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nathan ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would {disfmarker} they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: we're not gonna have to do as much design work\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .\nProject Manager: Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment .\nMarketing: And we're still not {disfmarker} then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: we can stick with what we've already got . In a lot other ways too .\nProject Manager: Okay . So I'm getting {disfmarker} alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay .\nMarketing: I think it's our lower risk option\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: which for right now {disfmarker} we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .\nProject Manager: Okay . Sorted .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .\nUser Interface: It's you and me outside a little here . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's {disfmarker} you guys's next step right ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it {disfmarker} what {vocalsound} f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ?\nProject Manager: Yes . We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement ,\nProject Manager: Mm . Yep .\nMarketing: like what if {disfmarker} wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light ,\nUser Interface: Calculator .\nMarketing: Yeah . True . True .\nIndustrial Designer: um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: What do you think Ron ?\nUser Interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Interesting .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?\nUser Interface: Just a thought .\nIndustrial Designer: What's the uh idea ?\nUser Interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .\nMarketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Do you think people that are {disfmarker} people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .\nMarketing: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,\nProject Manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well .\nMarketing: right .\nProject Manager: But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have {disfmarker} or like um {vocalsound} who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well .\nMarketing: With the bu yeah .\nProject Manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .\nIndustrial Designer: I think , I think you're on to something\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is {disfmarker} would be good , even though {disfmarker} and hand-held the same time .\nMarketing: True . Way to go .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things .\nMarketing: Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: you know like that little pod looking thing ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , those are nice .\nUser Interface: Exactly .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I mean a nice {disfmarker} although we do um wh uh is {disfmarker} I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: and get back to it\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh {disfmarker} using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: um you know\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit {disfmarker} gives just a bit . You know\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Just kind of the squishy feel .\nMarketing: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it {disfmarker} literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good .\nMarketing: Handy .\nProject Manager: Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , {vocalsound} um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We'll have more of an idea when the prototype {disfmarker} have more of a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and I'm just having to guess .\nProject Manager: we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . {vocalsound} Um , so\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we {disfmarker} wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um {vocalsound} a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .\nMarketing: Mm . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Like maybe have menu things .\nMarketing: Take precedence ,\nIndustrial Designer: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out\nMarketing: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .\nMarketing: And they slide .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah\nMarketing: True ,\nProject Manager: we've also got the the me the thing of ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: we're still not making it easier then .\nProject Manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: B But no I mean\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing: Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager: we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface: Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface: What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager: I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface: Sure .\nProject Manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer: So\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer: There's an idea .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: That sounds good .\nUser Interface: Fabulous .\nProject Manager: Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing: Cool .", "answers": ["The group found that if they would use the touch screen as well as the voice recognition technique, the cost would up to 17 euros.

Yes . OK .\nGrad E: OK , so for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} For people wearing the wireless mikes , like {disfmarker} like this one , I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this {disfmarker} this sorta like that .\nPhD H: This is {disfmarker} chan channel channel one one two three\nGrad F: Channel five , channel five .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Mm - hmm . What do you do ,\nGrad E: It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples ,\nGrad F: Test , test test .\nProfessor B: you do it higher ?\nGrad E: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , I think we 're supposed to {disfmarker} that 's right .\nGrad E: And then also , for {disfmarker} for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth ,\nGrad F: Test test .\nPhD A: By the way , there was a bug . Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper\nPhD D: Oh it was .\nGrad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth ,\nPhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: so about like I 'm wearing it now .\nPhD D: Oh that 's interesting . So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nGrad E: so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth ,\nPhD H: It 's not always possible .\nPhD A: Hmm ?\nPhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nPostdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: Is that @ @ ? OK , thank you .\nGrad F: Adam , I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD D: O Oh oh I see .\nGrad F: uh , looks kinda low on channel five {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I see , I see .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad F: no ?\nGrad E: Channel five , s speak again .\nGrad F: Maybe not .\nPostdoc G: Hello .\nPhD A: Basically there were no counts\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's alright .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad E: I mean , we could {disfmarker} we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to .\nGrad F: It 's OK ?\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad F: Is this OK ?\nPhD H: OK .\nPhD D: I see what you mean .\nPhD C: Who 's channel B ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker} Uh , channel B is probably Liz .\nPhD C: Uh oh .\nPhD H: Uh channel B {disfmarker} I am channel B .\nProfessor B: You wanna close this ,\nPostdoc G: Channel eight , eight .\nProfessor B: or\nPhD C: No I\nGrad E: Thank you .\nPhD H: No , channel B .\nPhD A: Hello , hello .\nPhD C: yeah , yeah , you 're channel B .\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah .\nPhD C: So can you talk a bit ? I thought it might be too\nPhD H: OK , yeah , channel B , one two three four five .\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's alright . So , the gain isn't real good .\nProfessor B: We 're recording ,\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor B: right ?\nGrad E: OK , so we are recording .\nPhD H: Ah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: Um we {disfmarker} we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it . And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .\nPhD H: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: We {disfmarker} we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank . Um I {disfmarker} I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: so\nPhD D: California .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: California .\nPhD H: California .\nPhD A: Um may I make one suggestion ? Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth\nGrad E: Sure .\nPhD A: because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .\nGrad E: Oh .\nPhD C: A actually , wait a minute ,\nGrad E: Birth year ?\nPostdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around ?\nPhD D: Not for me .\nPostdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the other side ,\nPhD A: Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: O yeah .\nPhD D: But there 's no other date on the form .\nPhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nPostdoc G: Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .\nGrad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .\nPhD A: Anyway .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , that 's true .\nPhD C: I still don't see the problem .\nGrad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is alright\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: so , anyway . And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time , the speaker form only once , the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting . OK ? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form . And that should just be one person whose name I don't know . OK ?\nGrad F: Do you want this {pause} Adam ?\nGrad E: Uh sure . Thank you .\nProfessor B: So uh\nGrad E: OK so should we do agenda items ?\nProfessor B: Uh oh that 's a good idea . I shouldn't run the meeting .\nGrad E: Uh well I have {disfmarker} I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results . Anything else ?\nPhD C: I guess {disfmarker} what time do we have to leave ? Three thirty ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nGrad E: Why don't you go first then .\nPhD C: so .\nProfessor B: Yeah , good idea .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Um Well , I {disfmarker} I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams {disfmarker} a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who {disfmarker} Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um {vocalsound} you know separated {disfmarker} used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so {disfmarker} so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that {disfmarker} that 's twenty minutes or so ? Um yeah because I guess there 's some ,\nGrad E: Or so .\nPhD C: and Don can talk to Jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm {disfmarker} we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} was that {disfmarker} did that {disfmarker} did that recording have the glitch in the middle ?\nPostdoc G: I 'm puzzled by that . I {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} oh , I see .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Oh there was a glitch somewhere .\nPhD C: yeah , so that actually um\nGrad F: Was it twenty minutes in ,\nPhD C: if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know\nPostdoc G: I forgot about that .\nGrad F: I thought {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well it was interesting ,\nPostdoc G: Well , I mean , they {disfmarker}\nPhD A: suddenly {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent\nGrad E: I don't remember when it is .\nPostdoc G: but I was able to can transcribe\nPhD A: but i looking at {disfmarker} the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the {disfmarker} it was actually recognized\nPhD C: Wel\nGrad E: Oh no .\nGrad F: Yeah , that might be {disfmarker} that might be {disfmarker} that might be my fault .\nPostdoc G: Wow .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .\nGrad F: I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: No actually it was {disfmarker} yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um\nGrad F: yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time ,\nPostdoc G: Oh . That 's not good .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: so that 's what we have\nGrad E: Alright .\nGrad F: so\nPhD C: but that {disfmarker} that will be completely gone if this synch time problem\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: The {disfmarker} the glitch\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to\nPostdoc G: And the only glitch {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: yeah .\nPhD C: So you guys know .\nProfessor B: S sorry I haven't seen the email ,\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Th - the\nPostdoc G: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} wait\nProfessor B: what was the score ?\nPhD C: So here 's the actual copy of the email\nPostdoc G: we should say something about the glitch . He {disfmarker} he can say something about the glitch .\nPhD C: um oh OK\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Cuz it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} h it 's {disfmarker} it 's very small {disfmarker}\nPhD C: so does this glitch occur at other {disfmarker}\nGrad E: There {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized\nPostdoc G: very small . Yep .\nPhD C: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad E: so the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad E: and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing {disfmarker} doing click sounds .\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And is it only once that that happens ?\nGrad E: But yeah\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: it {disfmarker} right once in the middle .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong\nProfessor B: so {disfmarker} so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice ,\nPhD C: but\nGrad E: Um But that shouldn't affect anything\nPhD C: OK so that 's actually\nPostdoc G: S and it {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: you see this here ?\nPhD C: It {disfmarker} y it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah yeah \" bah \"\nPhD C: OK no {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: What happens is it actually affects the script that Don {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Huh .\nPhD C: I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it\nGrad E: Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything .\nPhD C: but they\nGrad F: Yeah , I don't know exactly what affected it\nPostdoc G: I agree . I agree .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I have {disfmarker}\nGrad F: but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you about it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: But I {disfmarker} I do remember {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: I 'll show you the point .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . It {disfmarker} it had no effect on my transcription ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: you know , I mean I {disfmarker} I had no trouble hearing it and {disfmarker} and having time bins\nGrad E: I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .\nPostdoc G: but there was a {disfmarker} Oh .\nPhD C: Well , the {disfmarker} the synch time {disfmarker} the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should ,\nGrad F: That 's what happened .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad E: Where {disfmarker} where they weren't monotonic .\nGrad F: There was {disfmarker} yeah , I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: right ? There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh , interesting .\nPhD C: And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right\nGrad E: Oh OK so that 's\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: so anyway it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah sounds like a bug .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Non - zero ? Um there are like more {disfmarker} cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran ,\nGrad E: The other one I saw was that it yeah .\nGrad F: I mean but there were there was a point .\nPhD C: Yeah that was fine . That {disfmarker} that was OK .\nGrad E: The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: and that definitely indicra indicates a bug .\nGrad F: Uh .\nPhD C: Well that would really be a problem , yeah . So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: um and what 's {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So that 's very encouraging .\nPhD C: this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Cool .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which\nPhD D: Trent Lott .\nPhD C: um I mean these are sort of funny ones ,\nPhD D: It 'll get those though .\nPhD C: there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see\nGrad E: I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: but um it 's pretty good .\nGrad E: because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ?\nPhD C: Well so I guess we can generate\nGrad E: Sounds likes ?\nPhD A: There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where {disfmarker} got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Yeah , and who cares ? And {disfmarker} and there were lots of {disfmarker} of course the \" uh uh \" - s , \" in on \" - s \" of uh \" - s .\nPhD A: Mmm , so if {disfmarker}\nPhD C: there 's {disfmarker} No those are actually\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or\nGrad E: Right . Ri - ri right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Did you say there 's no language for PZM ?\nPhD C: No language model , I mean those {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean {disfmarker} so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings .\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet .\nProfessor B: Well , we don't even know what that means ,\nPhD C: so {vocalsound} but this is really encouraging because\nProfessor B: so I\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right .\nPhD C: so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of {disfmarker} of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained {disfmarker} mostly trained recognizer\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and Switchboard - two is {disfmarker} got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic\nGrad E: Excellent .\nPhD C: and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did {disfmarker} had the ninety - three workshop\nPhD C: Um\nProfessor B: and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Oh yeah\nProfessor B: you know\nPhD C: I mean this is really ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: Well especially for the very first run , I mean you {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh it 's the {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: eh um\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: yeah\nGrad E: the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but\nPhD C: So and what al also this means is that\nPostdoc G: Right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Not Switchboard ,\nPhD A: Well it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people\nGrad E: uh Broadcast News .\nPhD C: especially I guess um with Jane that {disfmarker} that would help for {disfmarker} since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring . I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so you know the language model was straight from {disfmarker} from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or {disfmarker} or\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nGrad E: Yeah , so that 's great .\nPhD C: No .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: And actually {disfmarker} we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nPhD A: Well that 's {disfmarker} those are the only we ones there are ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: which I guess\nPhD D: I was just gonna say ,\nPhD C: so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of\nPhD D: yeah .\nPhD A: I mean\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: and I guess Ramana , so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: it 's {disfmarker} it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech .\nPhD D: It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech\nPhD C: So .\nPhD A: Oh yeah .\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah ,\nPhD C: Right , so it 's {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: but for Broadcast News when we {disfmarker} we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss .\nGrad E: Right , it was not a big deal .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: I should {disfmarker} I should say that {disfmarker} the language model is not just Switchboard\nPhD C: so I wou so that 's good .\nGrad E: Although combining em worked well .\nPhD A: it 's also {disfmarker} I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: uh because\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Like Trent Lott must have been from\nPhD A: mm - hmm , right .\nPhD C: I guess {vocalsound} Switchboard was before\nPhD A: Um By the way just {disfmarker} for fun we also ran ,\nPhD C: uh .\nProfessor B: Good point .\nPhD A: I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: so just for the heck of it I ran that\nGrad E: And it said a hundred percent male ?\nPhD A: um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .\nPhD C: The j\nPhD A: Yeah so\nGrad E: Oh it did ?\nPostdoc G: Oh that 's {disfmarker} I 'm glad .\nGrad E: It got all two genders ?\nPhD C: Yeah but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance\nPhD A: Yeah . Yes .\nPhD C: and uh and that 's interesting cuz I think the {disfmarker} their language models are quite different so and I {disfmarker} I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Right .\nPostdoc G: That makes a lot of sense ,\nPhD C: So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when {disfmarker} when we get new microphones\nPostdoc G: yeah . Very possible .\nProfessor B: Yeah I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would bet on that too\nPhD C: that would be worth it\nProfessor B: cuz he certainly in that {disfmarker} when as a {disfmarker} as a burp user he was {disfmarker} he was a pretty uh strong one .\nPhD C: um Yeah\nGrad E: Sheep .\nPhD C: he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he sounded to me just from {disfmarker} he sounded like a ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: what 's it a sheep or a goat ?\nProfessor B: Sheep .\nGrad E: A sheep .\nPhD C: Sheep ,\nGrad E: Baah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Sheep is good .\nPhD C: right . Sounded good .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right so um so I guess the good news is that\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker} and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no {disfmarker} no tailoring at all .\nPhD A: I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . The voca the vocabulary especially\nGrad E: Or just dictionary .\nPhD C: yeah .\nPhD A: Not that much the vocabulary actually\nPhD C: Yeah , so .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker} um well we have to see but {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . It 's pretty good um so then\nProfessor B: Have to add PZM and so on\nGrad E: And I have to try it on the far field mike\nProfessor B: but\nPhD C: PZM\nGrad E: yeah .\nPhD C: and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL . there 's things like that where , you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but in general it was really good and I 'm hoping {disfmarker} and this is {disfmarker} this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments , I mean it 's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information . For example about , you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times . Um so that 'll be something that actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place . Because it 's just gonna give us time marks\nPhD D: But you know {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Well we 've done that for one meeting .\nPhD C: so . For forced alignment .\nGrad E: Uh oh oh f not for words\nPhD C: Ye - right .\nGrad E: I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not {disfmarker} not for words .\nPhD C: Right . So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and then I was thinking it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription . Maybe actually mark the word boundaries .\nPhD C: Oh or {disfmarker} i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy .\nGrad E: Right , right .\nPhD C: It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around , if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good . So that 's about it .\nProfessor B: I r\nPhD D: I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though , I mean if we 're pr\nGrad E: That we 're starting so well ?\nPhD D: yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody 's gonna do well on\nProfessor B: Oh\nGrad E: Don't worry about it w d that 's that 's the close talking mikes . Try it on the P Z Ms and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor B: Yeah , which {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} well n n n n\nPhD D: So the real value of the database is these ?\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , abso well no but\nProfessor B: I mean there 's still just the w the percentages and , I mean they 're not {disfmarker} a as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps\nPhD C: This i yeah . This is not that good .\nProfessor B: there 's probably overlaps in {disfmarker} in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so but {disfmarker} but there 's other phenomena , it 's a meeting , it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes but uh yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could , I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor B: and uh see if it 's , you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it 's not maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something and {disfmarker} and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: No I think it 's really , I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the {disfmarker} the text um yeah they 're pretty good so and {disfmarker} and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard so that 's good . And um let 's see there was one more thing I wanted to {disfmarker} to mention {disfmarker} I can't remember um Sorry can't remember . anyway it 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Congratulations is really great .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's really good .\nPhD C: so Andreas set up this recognizer and {disfmarker} by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there so I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um so\nPhD A: We {disfmarker} we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . That 's {disfmarker} you know if {disfmarker} if there are more machines um uh here plus people can {disfmarker} could run their own uh you know variants of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the recognition {pause} runs um certainly doable . Um .\nProfessor B: Yeah and {disfmarker} well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Seems reasonable .\nPostdoc G: I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Which is um so this issue {vocalsound} of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted {disfmarker} Yeah , well , so what I mean is um the {disfmarker} uh the data that you take into SRI , first {disfmarker} first question , you 're maintaining it in {disfmarker} in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that {disfmarker} that kind of stuff , right ?\nPhD A: U um\nPhD C: From the outside world or\nPostdoc G: By uh people uh who are not associated with this project .\nPhD A: Oh .\nGrad E: It 's human subjects issues , I told you about that .\nPhD C: Um oh .\nPostdoc G: Exactly .\nPhD C: Well OK we have n no names . Although I sh um\nGrad E: That {disfmarker} that 's not the issue ,\nPhD C: de audio data itself ?\nGrad E: it 's just the audio data itself , until people have a chance to edit it .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm , exactly .\nPhD C: Uh so well I can {disfmarker} I can protect my directories through there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right now they 're not {disfmarker} they 're in the speech group directories which {disfmarker} so I will {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: I didn't know that actually .\nProfessor B: Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,\nPhD C: Yeah OK .\nProfessor B: say it 's OK .\nPhD C: Right OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , we had to get them to approve em and then i cuz {disfmarker} cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's but this {disfmarker} this meeting that you have , no problem cuz I {disfmarker} I well I mean I {disfmarker} I speak for myself\nGrad E: It 's us .\nPostdoc G: but {disfmarker} but I think that we didn't do anything that but well anyway so {vocalsound} uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects\nPhD C: That 's true .\nPostdoc G: and I don't know how that stands , I mean if you {disfmarker} if you get fantastic results and it 's involving {comment} data which {disfmarker} which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know but I wanted to raise that issue ,\nProfessor B: Well we ,\nPostdoc G: that 's all .\nProfessor B: I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it {disfmarker} hopefully it will be fairly quick but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on it 's just that we 're\nGrad E: Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: and get back any bleeps that they want\nPhD C: Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought .\nProfessor B: It 's gonna be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part .\nPhD A: U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling , um I don't know who , I mean how this was done but is {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} are there any um {vocalsound} issues with downsampling\nPhD C: Don did this .\nPhD A: because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly um so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand . And is there any um i are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ?\nGrad F: There are lots of w {vocalsound} there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on ,\nPhD A: OK . Right . OK .\nGrad F: like anti - aliasing stuff .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} th\nGrad E: I don't think we even know which one I assume you 're using syncat to do it ?\nGrad F: No , I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample .\nGrad E: Or sound resample ?\nPhD C: Re - re ref\nGrad E: Resample .\nPhD C: yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms .\nGrad F: RSMP . Yeah , I don't really .\nPhD C: Missing all the vowels .\nGrad F: I just {disfmarker} yeah I found it .\nPhD C: Some of the vowels ,\nGrad E: Not all of them .\nPhD C: almost all the vowels , that 's the hard part .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,\nGrad E: And a few of the consonants .\nPhD A: I mean segment them but not downsample them .\nPhD C: Yeah we could {disfmarker} we could try that and {disfmarker} and compare\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and feed them to {disfmarker} feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if {disfmarker} if the SRI front - end does something .\nGrad F: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I suspect that 's sort of premature optimization , but Sure .\nPhD C: We can try it . I {disfmarker} I only downsampled them first cuz I was\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I mean that 's just one line {disfmarker} that 's one line of code to comment at\nPhD C: yeah\nPhD A: Right and {disfmarker} and it doesn't {disfmarker} is no more work {vocalsound} for um you know for us .\nGrad F: so\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: Well they 're just bigger to transfer , that 's why I s downsampled them before but\nPhD A: Well but they 're only twice as big so\nPhD C: Well I mean that was {disfmarker} if it 's the same then we can downsample here\nPhD A: I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a\nPhD C: but if it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: so , but no , I mean it 's not {disfmarker} i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it {disfmarker}\nPhD C: We could try that .\nPhD A: Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know\nGrad F: it would {disfmarker}\nPhD A: minus the transfer time it would {disfmarker} it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's about a fifty minute drive , right ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why\nPhD C: Well it takes more disk space too so I was just {disfmarker}\nPhD A: and , you know , what {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad F: Mmm . In the front - end we could do that .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So you just train {disfmarker} just different filters\nGrad F: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is\nGrad F: Yeah , I can imagine it would be {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD C: So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences .\nGrad F: I mean I guess there 's some {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD A: So in other words right ,\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that . I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other I don't think that gives you any information .\nPhD C: Well it 's just as easy to {disfmarker} to give you the sixteen K individual ,\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: it was just more disk space you know for storing them\nProfessor B: Are you {disfmarker} are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ?\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: Mel cepstrum .\nProfessor B: So probably doesn't matter .\nPhD C: Well we could try .\nGrad F: There 's {disfmarker} there 's your answer .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but it wouldn't hurt to try ,\nPhD C: Could easily try\nPhD A: That 's what I would assume but you never know ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: you know .\nProfessor B: Sure . No the reason I say this\nPostdoc G: Just {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not {disfmarker} b you wouldn't expect to be so much but\nPhD C: Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti stick them somewhere\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really not a problem .\nPhD A: Actually , no .\nPhD C: and I 'll rerun it with\nPhD A: Don't stop . Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters ,\nGrad F: Keep going . Yeah .\nPhD A: so shouldn't use {disfmarker} you should s you know , get\nGrad F: Yeah , I mean I 'll {disfmarker} I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same ,\nPhD C: OK .\nPhD A:  Right .\nGrad F: it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right . Right .\nGrad F: and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory ,\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: I mean I corrected all {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: that 's not a problem .\nPhD C: I mean I hand - edited the whole {disfmarker} the whole meeting so that can be run it 's just {disfmarker} Once we get the {disfmarker} the bug out .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: One {disfmarker} one question which is I {disfmarker} I had the impression {comment} from this {disfmarker} from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc G: is that I thought that in order to\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: so it was {disfmarker} so it 's like there 's already down\nGrad E: There 's one level that 's already happening right here .\nProfessor B: This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs\nPostdoc G: OK .\nGrad E: Right .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: And it gets downsampled to sixteen .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: And that 's actually said in your meeting ,\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh OK .\nPhD C: that 's how I know that .\nPostdoc G: That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} It 's like are we downsampling to sixteen ?\nProfessor B: It 's a digital audio orientation for the board\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor B: it 's in the monitor so it 's\nPhD C: Thank God it 's not {vocalsound} more than that .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And I have no idea what filter it 's using ,\nGrad F: Is eight kilohertz {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ?\nGrad E: so\nProfessor B: For telephone stuff .\nGrad E: Telephone .\nPhD D: Telephone .\nGrad F: Yeah that 's what I was gonna say , I mean like {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database\nGrad F: so Oh , I see , so .\nProfessor B: and so that was a standard for that sixteen s\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing .\nProfessor B: Sixteen is more common for {disfmarker} for uh broadband stuff that isn't {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: That isn't music .\nProfessor B: that isn't music and isn't telephone ,\nPhD C: And I guess if you 're comparing like {disfmarker} uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: Why is that ?\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: right ? Well I don I mean if it 's any better\nProfessor B: No actually I would think that you would {disfmarker} you would get better {disfmarker} you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike .\nGrad E: All the way around I 'd think .\nProfessor B: Uh but who knows ? I mean we do {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna find all this stuff out ,\nPhD C: Yeah well we could try it .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: we don't know .\nGrad E: We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans .\nPhD C: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um well {disfmarker} well it 's sort of related but um good news also uh I got {disfmarker} well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on {disfmarker} on\nPhD A: They 're less animated .\nPhD C: Well but he has fewer {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he won't have more than eight and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU , so that sounds interesting . As a compliment to our front - end meeting\nGrad E: Dot EDU ?\nPhD C: and um so that 's gonna start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it or {disfmarker} or put a {vocalsound} push a button or something when they wanna make a note about \" oh boy you should probably erase those last few \" or uh \" wait I want this not to be recorded now \" or uh something like that s\nProfessor B: Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ?\nPostdoc G: The cross pads ?\nGrad E: Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads .\nPhD C: Cuz I was thinking you know if {disfmarker} if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know um and this came up talking to {disfmarker} to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate {disfmarker} to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: so I don't know if anyone has ideas or {disfmarker} you could even write down \" oh it 's about three twenty five and \" {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well what I was just suggesting is {disfmarker} is we have these {disfmarker} this cross pad just for this purpose\nGrad E: Yeah , and use that .\nProfessor B: and just use that\nGrad E: Not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: and if we sink it in {disfmarker}\nPhD C: That would be great .\nProfessor B: The other thing is eh\nPhD C: That be great .\nProfessor B: I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ?\nGrad E: I don't know . I don't know . I 'll send mail to Dan and ask . I {disfmarker} I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it 's one board with two digital channels .\nProfessor B: Oh it is one board .\nGrad E: E eight each . So it {disfmarker} it takes two fibers in to the one board . And so w I think if we wanna do that {disfmarker} more than that we 'd have to have two boards , and then you have the synchronization issue .\nProfessor B: But that 's a question because that would {disfmarker} if it was possible cuz it is i you know already we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor B: and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store , right it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: What is the limit on each of those f fiber channels , is it the\nGrad E: Eight .\nPhD D: It just {disfmarker} it 's eight channels come in , does it have do with the sampling rate ?\nGrad E: It 's eight . I have no idea . But each {disfmarker} each fiber channel has eight {disfmarker} eight channels and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card .\nProfessor B: It might be a hard limitation ,\nGrad E: So\nProfessor B: I mean one thing is it {disfmarker} the whole thing as I said is {disfmarker} is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes requirements up a bit\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: but\nPhD D: I was just wondering if {disfmarker} if that could change .\nGrad E: I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff .\nPhD D: If we could drop that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: So I {disfmarker} I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK on the uh are we done with that ? So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes , so I got a quote um We can fit {disfmarker} we have room for one more wireless and the wireless , this unit here is three fifty {disfmarker} three hundred fifty dollars , it {disfmarker} I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner {disfmarker} the receiver {disfmarker} the other end , that 's uh four thirty um and then also\nPhD C: For {disfmarker} for each ?\nPhD D: Wow .\nPhD C: I mean the tuner is four thirty for each .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: Wow .\nGrad E: And we just need one more so {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: Yeah at least w we got the good ones .\nGrad E: Yeah . So that 's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these .\nProfessor B: Yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: So if we wanna use a different set {disfmarker} headset the solution that the guy suggested and they {disfmarker} apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . And that 's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece and the {disfmarker} he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece .\nProfessor B: There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in , you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ?\nGrad E: Becau - the reason is the only {disfmarker} only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector .\nProfessor B: No I understand . The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this .\nGrad E: Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us ,\nPhD D: Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too ,\nGrad E: so .\nProfessor B: Well\nPhD D: they 'd\nProfessor B: no they 'll just charge us more , so it 's {disfmarker} this\nPhD D: Mmm .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker} so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?\nProfessor B: Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .\nGrad E: So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And {disfmarker} and see if that works .\nProfessor B: And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more .\nPhD C: Comfort .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK it 's just the {disfmarker} the\nGrad E: Right , it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: Could make our own handbands and\nGrad E: Um , and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA and so it will take about a week to get here .\nProfessor B: Yeah well it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um so OK to just go order ?\nProfessor B: We 're in this for the long term , yeah . Just order it .\nGrad E: OK\nPhD C: It 's a lot of money for a handband .\nGrad E: and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: cuz I think that 's how we did it before .\nProfessor B: Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a long time to get from LA .\nGrad E: OK . And then nine channels is the maximum we can do , so .\nProfessor B: Uh y right cuz {disfmarker} so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen\nGrad E: Without getting more stuff .\nProfessor B: and there 's six on the table so that 's nine .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Can I ask a really dumb question ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is there any way we can have you know like a {disfmarker} a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk that {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Probably .\nProfessor B: That 's a good idea .\nPhD C: I mean {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: That 's not a dumb question , it 's a good idea ,\nPhD C: Well I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the\nGrad F: That 's like the Conch .\nPhD C: Well but {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Like at conferences\nPhD A: you know r\nPhD C: well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people\nGrad F: See , look .\nPhD C: um and I don't know identifying somehow ?\nPhD D: so nail the chairs down .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , somehow .\nPhD C: You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer .\nGrad E: It 's not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: No that {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} no\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: that 's a very {disfmarker} if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work .\nPhD D: The Springer mike .\nPhD C: I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that .\nProfessor B: Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: A hand - held , yeah .\nProfessor B: that 's a good idea\nPhD D: Infinite expansion .\nProfessor B: Right . Kind of rules out overlap but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but uh\nPhD C: Well or also for you know if people are not\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Well we could just hand around the lapel .\nProfessor B: Uh no {disfmarker} no that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Rather than get a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No not the lapel .\nGrad E: do you want a handset ?\nProfessor B: No .\nGrad E: Well I mean is the {disfmarker} is the hand - held really any better ?\nPhD D: Liz hates the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yes .\nPhD C: I don't know\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: but I d I know the lapel is really suboptimal .\nProfessor B: No it {disfmarker} no it depends on the hand - held\nGrad E: Is awful ?\nProfessor B: but hand {disfmarker} many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it {disfmarker} it is less uh susceptible to hand noises . If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Right . I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of OK .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nGrad E: So I wonder if they have one that will hook up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . They have {disfmarker} What ?\nGrad E: I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves .\nPhD D: Well , you wouldn't want it to hook there you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room , right ?\nProfessor B: No that 's uh {disfmarker} you need a transmitter .\nGrad E: What ?\nPhD D: Is th isn't that built into the mike ?\nProfessor B: Oh I see . Get a {disfmarker} get a different radio , yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless\nProfessor B: Yeah . But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .\nPhD D: Have a little antenna coming out the bottom .\nGrad E: It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike , isn't it ?\nPhD D: But then the mike has to h\nPhD A: Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of\nProfessor B: No no {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: so right , so this is a good point , so yeah you have these {disfmarker} these mikes with a little antenna on the end right ?\nGrad E: OK . And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?\nProfessor B: I don't know . You 'll have to check with them ,\nGrad E: OK I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll ask .\nProfessor B: yeah . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's a great idea\nPhD D: It 's just a frequency .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then just sort of have that as the {disfmarker} and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and {disfmarker} and uh\nPhD C: Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large {disfmarker} the larger the group the less interaction {disfmarker} the less people are talking um over each other {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Pretty soon .\nPhD D: Mmm , yeah .\nPhD C: it just {disfmarker} there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: Um Gotta go .\nProfessor B: Off you go , yeah .\nGrad E: OK so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?\nPostdoc G: I {disfmarker} I thought of some extra {disfmarker} a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention .\nGrad E: OK .\nPostdoc G: One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine\nGrad E: uh Yep ,\nPostdoc G: and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month , I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten .\nPhD C: Uh it 's great {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Pretty close ,\nPostdoc G: So they 're still working .\nProfessor B: that 's good .\nPhD C: I j and this {disfmarker} I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something\nPhD D: Wow .\nGrad E: that 's good .\nPhD C: so it 's really great\nPostdoc G: It 's working out , thanks .\nPhD C: It 's really great .\nPostdoc G: Thanks . And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data It 's sort of a {disfmarker} a little bit {disfmarker} a little bit\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nProfessor B: Super idea .\nGrad E: Yep , that 'd be very interesting .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things ,\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'd love to hear what they have to say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's a great idea .\nPhD D: So if we got them to talk about this meeting , it would be a meta {disfmarker} meta meeting .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah , exa {vocalsound} exactly I guess {disfmarker} nested several layers ,\nProfessor B: Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us\nPostdoc G: but\nProfessor B: so how do we do this , is the only thing .\nPhD C: Or just have them talk amongst themselves .\nPhD D: Have them have their own meeting .\nPhD C: And have\nPostdoc G: Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,\nProfessor B: Oh .\nPostdoc G: yeah . Have them talk about the data and they {disfmarker} and they 've made observations to me\nPhD C: that would be great .\nPostdoc G: like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , you know it 's part of it 's {disfmarker} it 's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nGrad E: Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Be great .\nProfessor B: So maybe we could {disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Give us a status .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh good . OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .\nGrad E: Great .\nGrad J: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be {disfmarker} I 'll be working on this .\nGrad E: And are you staying at Berkeley or is {disfmarker} are you just here a semester ?\nGrad J: This is my second semester and last .\nGrad E: Ah second and last ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad J: So I leave\nProfessor B: He 's in the {disfmarker} he 's in the cour two two five D course .\nGrad J: Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course ,\nProfessor B: So , yeah .\nGrad J: yeah .\nGrad E: Good .\nPhD D: Welcome .\nPostdoc G: Then you {disfmarker} then you go back to Norway , that 's OK .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nGrad F: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the {vocalsound} echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK ,\nGrad E: Digits ?\nProfessor B: let 's do digits . OK .\nGrad E: And stop .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What was the general discussion?\nAnswer:", "input": "What was the general discussion?", "context": "Grad F: Test .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: Let 's see , I should be Two .\nPhD D: Up high {disfmarker}\nGrad E: As close to your mouth as you can get it .\nProfessor B: La\nPhD D: high as you can get .\nProfessor B: Is this channel one ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah , on your upper lip .\nPhD H: Channel one one one .\nProfessor B: Gee , OK . Yes . OK .\nGrad E: OK , so for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} For people wearing the wireless mikes , like {disfmarker} like this one , I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this {disfmarker} this sorta like that .\nPhD H: This is {disfmarker} chan channel channel one one two three\nGrad F: Channel five , channel five .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Mm - hmm . What do you do ,\nGrad E: It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples ,\nGrad F: Test , test test .\nProfessor B: you do it higher ?\nGrad E: so {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , I think we 're supposed to {disfmarker} that 's right .\nGrad E: And then also , for {disfmarker} for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth ,\nGrad F: Test test .\nPhD A: By the way , there was a bug . Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper\nPhD D: Oh it was .\nGrad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth ,\nPhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything .\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: so about like I 'm wearing it now .\nPhD D: Oh that 's interesting . So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nGrad E: so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth ,\nPhD H: It 's not always possible .\nPhD A: Hmm ?\nPhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?\nPostdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: Is that @ @ ? OK , thank you .\nGrad F: Adam , I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD D: O Oh oh I see .\nGrad F: uh , looks kinda low on channel five {disfmarker}\nPhD D: I see , I see .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad F: no ?\nGrad E: Channel five , s speak again .\nGrad F: Maybe not .\nPostdoc G: Hello .\nPhD A: Basically there were no counts\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's alright .\nGrad F: Hello ?\nGrad E: I mean , we could {disfmarker} we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to .\nGrad F: It 's OK ?\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad F: Is this OK ?\nPhD H: OK .\nPhD D: I see what you mean .\nPhD C: Who 's channel B ?\nGrad E: but {disfmarker} Uh , channel B is probably Liz .\nPhD C: Uh oh .\nPhD H: Uh channel B {disfmarker} I am channel B .\nProfessor B: You wanna close this ,\nPostdoc G: Channel eight , eight .\nProfessor B: or\nPhD C: No I\nGrad E: Thank you .\nPhD H: No , channel B .\nPhD A: Hello , hello .\nPhD C: yeah , yeah , you 're channel B .\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah .\nPhD C: So can you talk a bit ? I thought it might be too\nPhD H: OK , yeah , channel B , one two three four five .\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's alright . So , the gain isn't real good .\nProfessor B: We 're recording ,\nPhD C: OK .\nProfessor B: right ?\nGrad E: OK , so we are recording .\nPhD H: Ah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: Um we {disfmarker} we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it . And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .\nPhD H: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: We {disfmarker} we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank . Um I {disfmarker} I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: so\nPhD D: California .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: California .\nPhD H: California .\nPhD A: Um may I make one suggestion ? Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth\nGrad E: Sure .\nPhD A: because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .\nGrad E: Oh .\nPhD C: A actually , wait a minute ,\nGrad E: Birth year ?\nPostdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around ?\nPhD D: Not for me .\nPostdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the other side ,\nPhD A: Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}\nPhD C: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: O yeah .\nPhD D: But there 's no other date on the form .\nPhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nPostdoc G: Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .\nGrad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .\nPhD A: Anyway .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , that 's true .\nPhD C: I still don't see the problem .\nGrad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is alright\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad E: and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: so , anyway . And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time , the speaker form only once , the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting . OK ? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form . And that should just be one person whose name I don't know . OK ?\nGrad F: Do you want this {pause} Adam ?\nGrad E: Uh sure . Thank you .\nProfessor B: So uh\nGrad E: OK so should we do agenda items ?\nProfessor B: Uh oh that 's a good idea . I shouldn't run the meeting .\nGrad E: Uh well I have {disfmarker} I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results . Anything else ?\nPhD C: I guess {disfmarker} what time do we have to leave ? Three thirty ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nGrad E: Why don't you go first then .\nPhD C: so .\nProfessor B: Yeah , good idea .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Um Well , I {disfmarker} I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams {disfmarker} a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who {disfmarker} Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um {vocalsound} you know separated {disfmarker} used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so {disfmarker} so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that {disfmarker} that 's twenty minutes or so ? Um yeah because I guess there 's some ,\nGrad E: Or so .\nPhD C: and Don can talk to Jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm {disfmarker} we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} was that {disfmarker} did that {disfmarker} did that recording have the glitch in the middle ?\nPostdoc G: I 'm puzzled by that . I {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} oh , I see .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Oh there was a glitch somewhere .\nPhD C: yeah , so that actually um\nGrad F: Was it twenty minutes in ,\nPhD C: if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know\nPostdoc G: I forgot about that .\nGrad F: I thought {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well it was interesting ,\nPostdoc G: Well , I mean , they {disfmarker}\nPhD A: suddenly {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent\nGrad E: I don't remember when it is .\nPostdoc G: but I was able to can transcribe\nPhD A: but i looking at {disfmarker} the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the {disfmarker} it was actually recognized\nPhD C: Wel\nGrad E: Oh no .\nGrad F: Yeah , that might be {disfmarker} that might be {disfmarker} that might be my fault .\nPostdoc G: Wow .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .\nGrad F: I 'm not {disfmarker}\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: No actually it was {disfmarker} yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um\nGrad F: yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time ,\nPostdoc G: Oh . That 's not good .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: so that 's what we have\nGrad E: Alright .\nGrad F: so\nPhD C: but that {disfmarker} that will be completely gone if this synch time problem\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: The {disfmarker} the glitch\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to\nPostdoc G: And the only glitch {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: yeah .\nPhD C: So you guys know .\nProfessor B: S sorry I haven't seen the email ,\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Th - the\nPostdoc G: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} wait\nProfessor B: what was the score ?\nPhD C: So here 's the actual copy of the email\nPostdoc G: we should say something about the glitch . He {disfmarker} he can say something about the glitch .\nPhD C: um oh OK\nGrad E: yeah .\nPostdoc G: Cuz it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} h it 's {disfmarker} it 's very small {disfmarker}\nPhD C: so does this glitch occur at other {disfmarker}\nGrad E: There {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized\nPostdoc G: very small . Yep .\nPhD C: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad E: so the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad E: and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing {disfmarker} doing click sounds .\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And is it only once that that happens ?\nGrad E: But yeah\nPhD C: OK .\nGrad E: it {disfmarker} right once in the middle .\nPhD C: There 's {disfmarker} the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong\nProfessor B: so {disfmarker} so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice ,\nPhD C: but\nGrad E: Um But that shouldn't affect anything\nPhD C: OK so that 's actually\nPostdoc G: S and it {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: you see this here ?\nPhD C: It {disfmarker} y it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah yeah \" bah \"\nPhD C: OK no {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh , and {disfmarker}\nPhD C: What happens is it actually affects the script that Don {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Huh .\nPhD C: I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it\nGrad E: Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything .\nPhD C: but they\nGrad F: Yeah , I don't know exactly what affected it\nPostdoc G: I agree . I agree .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I have {disfmarker}\nGrad F: but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you about it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: But I {disfmarker} I do remember {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: I 'll show you the point .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . It {disfmarker} it had no effect on my transcription ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: you know , I mean I {disfmarker} I had no trouble hearing it and {disfmarker} and having time bins\nGrad E: I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .\nPostdoc G: but there was a {disfmarker} Oh .\nPhD C: Well , the {disfmarker} the synch time {disfmarker} the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should ,\nGrad F: That 's what happened .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nGrad E: Where {disfmarker} where they weren't monotonic .\nGrad F: There was {disfmarker} yeah , I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: right ? There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh , interesting .\nPhD C: And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right\nGrad E: Oh OK so that 's\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: so anyway it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad E: yeah sounds like a bug .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Non - zero ? Um there are like more {disfmarker} cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran ,\nGrad E: The other one I saw was that it yeah .\nGrad F: I mean but there were there was a point .\nPhD C: Yeah that was fine . That {disfmarker} that was OK .\nGrad E: The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: and that definitely indicra indicates a bug .\nGrad F: Uh .\nPhD C: Well that would really be a problem , yeah . So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: um and what 's {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So that 's very encouraging .\nPhD C: this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD H: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Cool .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which\nPhD D: Trent Lott .\nPhD C: um I mean these are sort of funny ones ,\nPhD D: It 'll get those though .\nPhD C: there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see\nGrad E: I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: but um it 's pretty good .\nGrad E: because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ?\nPhD C: Well so I guess we can generate\nGrad E: Sounds likes ?\nPhD A: There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where {disfmarker} got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Yeah , and who cares ? And {disfmarker} and there were lots of {disfmarker} of course the \" uh uh \" - s , \" in on \" - s \" of uh \" - s .\nPhD A: Mmm , so if {disfmarker}\nPhD C: there 's {disfmarker} No those are actually\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or\nGrad E: Right . Ri - ri right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Did you say there 's no language for PZM ?\nPhD C: No language model , I mean those {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean {disfmarker} so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings .\nPhD C: Well {disfmarker} well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet .\nProfessor B: Well , we don't even know what that means ,\nPhD C: so {vocalsound} but this is really encouraging because\nProfessor B: so I\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's right .\nPhD C: so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of {disfmarker} of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained {disfmarker} mostly trained recognizer\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and Switchboard - two is {disfmarker} got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic\nGrad E: Excellent .\nPhD C: and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did {disfmarker} had the ninety - three workshop\nPhD C: Um\nProfessor B: and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Oh yeah\nProfessor B: you know\nPhD C: I mean this is really ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: Well especially for the very first run , I mean you {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Oh it 's the {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: eh um\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: yeah\nGrad E: the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but\nPhD C: So and what al also this means is that\nPostdoc G: Right .\nPhD C: um\nGrad E: Not Switchboard ,\nPhD A: Well it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people\nGrad E: uh Broadcast News .\nPhD C: especially I guess um with Jane that {disfmarker} that would help for {disfmarker} since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring . I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so you know the language model was straight from {disfmarker} from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or {disfmarker} or\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nGrad E: Yeah , so that 's great .\nPhD C: No .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: And actually {disfmarker} we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models\nPostdoc G: That 's amazing .\nPhD A: Well that 's {disfmarker} those are the only we ones there are ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: which I guess\nPhD D: I was just gonna say ,\nPhD C: so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of\nPhD D: yeah .\nPhD A: I mean\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: and I guess Ramana , so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: it 's {disfmarker} it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech .\nPhD D: It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech\nPhD C: So .\nPhD A: Oh yeah .\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah ,\nPhD C: Right , so it 's {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: but for Broadcast News when we {disfmarker} we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss .\nGrad E: Right , it was not a big deal .\nPhD C: Yeah\nPhD A: I should {disfmarker} I should say that {disfmarker} the language model is not just Switchboard\nPhD C: so I wou so that 's good .\nGrad E: Although combining em worked well .\nPhD A: it 's also {disfmarker} I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: uh because\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Like Trent Lott must have been from\nPhD A: mm - hmm , right .\nPhD C: I guess {vocalsound} Switchboard was before\nPhD A: Um By the way just {disfmarker} for fun we also ran ,\nPhD C: uh .\nProfessor B: Good point .\nPhD A: I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: so just for the heck of it I ran that\nGrad E: And it said a hundred percent male ?\nPhD A: um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .\nPhD C: The j\nPhD A: Yeah so\nGrad E: Oh it did ?\nPostdoc G: Oh that 's {disfmarker} I 'm glad .\nGrad E: It got all two genders ?\nPhD C: Yeah but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance\nPhD A: Yeah . Yes .\nPhD C: and uh and that 's interesting cuz I think the {disfmarker} their language models are quite different so and I {disfmarker} I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Right .\nPostdoc G: That makes a lot of sense ,\nPhD C: So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when {disfmarker} when we get new microphones\nPostdoc G: yeah . Very possible .\nProfessor B: Yeah I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would bet on that too\nPhD C: that would be worth it\nProfessor B: cuz he certainly in that {disfmarker} when as a {disfmarker} as a burp user he was {disfmarker} he was a pretty uh strong one .\nPhD C: um Yeah\nGrad E: Sheep .\nPhD C: he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he sounded to me just from {disfmarker} he sounded like a ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: what 's it a sheep or a goat ?\nProfessor B: Sheep .\nGrad E: A sheep .\nPhD C: Sheep ,\nGrad E: Baah .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Sheep is good .\nPhD C: right . Sounded good .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right so um so I guess the good news is that\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker} and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no {disfmarker} no tailoring at all .\nPhD A: I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . The voca the vocabulary especially\nGrad E: Or just dictionary .\nPhD C: yeah .\nPhD A: Not that much the vocabulary actually\nPhD C: Yeah , so .\nPhD A: I think {disfmarker} um well we have to see but {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . It 's pretty good um so then\nProfessor B: Have to add PZM and so on\nGrad E: And I have to try it on the far field mike\nProfessor B: but\nPhD C: PZM\nGrad E: yeah .\nPhD C: and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL . there 's things like that where , you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but in general it was really good and I 'm hoping {disfmarker} and this is {disfmarker} this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments , I mean it 's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information . For example about , you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times . Um so that 'll be something that actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place . Because it 's just gonna give us time marks\nPhD D: But you know {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Well we 've done that for one meeting .\nPhD C: so . For forced alignment .\nGrad E: Uh oh oh f not for words\nPhD C: Ye - right .\nGrad E: I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not {disfmarker} not for words .\nPhD C: Right . So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: and then I was thinking it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription . Maybe actually mark the word boundaries .\nPhD C: Oh or {disfmarker} i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy .\nGrad E: Right , right .\nPhD C: It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around , if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good . So that 's about it .\nProfessor B: I r\nPhD D: I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though , I mean if we 're pr\nGrad E: That we 're starting so well ?\nPhD D: yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody 's gonna do well on\nProfessor B: Oh\nGrad E: Don't worry about it w d that 's that 's the close talking mikes . Try it on the P Z Ms and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor B: Yeah , which {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} well n n n n\nPhD D: So the real value of the database is these ?\nPhD H: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , abso well no but\nProfessor B: I mean there 's still just the w the percentages and , I mean they 're not {disfmarker} a as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps\nPhD C: This i yeah . This is not that good .\nProfessor B: there 's probably overlaps in {disfmarker} in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so but {disfmarker} but there 's other phenomena , it 's a meeting , it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes but uh yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could , I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the\nPhD C: Right .\nProfessor B: and uh see if it 's , you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it 's not maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something and {disfmarker} and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: No I think it 's really , I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the {disfmarker} the text um yeah they 're pretty good so and {disfmarker} and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard so that 's good . And um let 's see there was one more thing I wanted to {disfmarker} to mention {disfmarker} I can't remember um Sorry can't remember . anyway it 's {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Congratulations is really great .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself\nGrad E: Yeah , it 's really good .\nPhD C: so Andreas set up this recognizer and {disfmarker} by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there so I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um so\nPhD A: We {disfmarker} we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . That 's {disfmarker} you know if {disfmarker} if there are more machines um uh here plus people can {disfmarker} could run their own uh you know variants of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the recognition {pause} runs um certainly doable . Um .\nProfessor B: Yeah and {disfmarker} well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Seems reasonable .\nPostdoc G: I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Which is um so this issue {vocalsound} of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted {disfmarker} Yeah , well , so what I mean is um the {disfmarker} uh the data that you take into SRI , first {disfmarker} first question , you 're maintaining it in {disfmarker} in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that {disfmarker} that kind of stuff , right ?\nPhD A: U um\nPhD C: From the outside world or\nPostdoc G: By uh people uh who are not associated with this project .\nPhD A: Oh .\nGrad E: It 's human subjects issues , I told you about that .\nPhD C: Um oh .\nPostdoc G: Exactly .\nPhD C: Well OK we have n no names . Although I sh um\nGrad E: That {disfmarker} that 's not the issue ,\nPhD C: de audio data itself ?\nGrad E: it 's just the audio data itself , until people have a chance to edit it .\nPostdoc G: Mm - hmm , exactly .\nPhD C: Uh so well I can {disfmarker} I can protect my directories through there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Right now they 're not {disfmarker} they 're in the speech group directories which {disfmarker} so I will {disfmarker}\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: I didn't know that actually .\nProfessor B: Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,\nPhD C: Yeah OK .\nProfessor B: say it 's OK .\nPhD C: Right OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah , we had to get them to approve em and then i cuz {disfmarker} cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's but this {disfmarker} this meeting that you have , no problem cuz I {disfmarker} I well I mean I {disfmarker} I speak for myself\nGrad E: It 's us .\nPostdoc G: but {disfmarker} but I think that we didn't do anything that but well anyway so {vocalsound} uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects\nPhD C: That 's true .\nPostdoc G: and I don't know how that stands , I mean if you {disfmarker} if you get fantastic results and it 's involving {comment} data which {disfmarker} which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know but I wanted to raise that issue ,\nProfessor B: Well we ,\nPostdoc G: that 's all .\nProfessor B: I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it {disfmarker} hopefully it will be fairly quick but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on it 's just that we 're\nGrad E: Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: and get back any bleeps that they want\nPhD C: Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought .\nProfessor B: It 's gonna be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part .\nPhD A: U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling , um I don't know who , I mean how this was done but is {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} are there any um {vocalsound} issues with downsampling\nPhD C: Don did this .\nPhD A: because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly um so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand . And is there any um i are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ?\nGrad F: There are lots of w {vocalsound} there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on ,\nPhD A: OK . Right . OK .\nGrad F: like anti - aliasing stuff .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} th\nGrad E: I don't think we even know which one I assume you 're using syncat to do it ?\nGrad F: No , I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample .\nGrad E: Or sound resample ?\nPhD C: Re - re ref\nGrad E: Resample .\nPhD C: yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms .\nGrad F: RSMP . Yeah , I don't really .\nPhD C: Missing all the vowels .\nGrad F: I just {disfmarker} yeah I found it .\nPhD C: Some of the vowels ,\nGrad E: Not all of them .\nPhD C: almost all the vowels , that 's the hard part .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,\nGrad E: And a few of the consonants .\nPhD A: I mean segment them but not downsample them .\nPhD C: Yeah we could {disfmarker} we could try that and {disfmarker} and compare\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and feed them to {disfmarker} feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if {disfmarker} if the SRI front - end does something .\nGrad F: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I suspect that 's sort of premature optimization , but Sure .\nPhD C: We can try it . I {disfmarker} I only downsampled them first cuz I was\nPhD A: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I mean that 's just one line {disfmarker} that 's one line of code to comment at\nPhD C: yeah\nPhD A: Right and {disfmarker} and it doesn't {disfmarker} is no more work {vocalsound} for um you know for us .\nGrad F: so\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD C: Well they 're just bigger to transfer , that 's why I s downsampled them before but\nPhD A: Well but they 're only twice as big so\nPhD C: Well I mean that was {disfmarker} if it 's the same then we can downsample here\nPhD A: I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a\nPhD C: but if it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: so , but no , I mean it 's not {disfmarker} i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it {disfmarker}\nPhD C: We could try that .\nPhD A: Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know\nGrad F: it would {disfmarker}\nPhD A: minus the transfer time it would {disfmarker} it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's about a fifty minute drive , right ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why\nPhD C: Well it takes more disk space too so I was just {disfmarker}\nPhD A: and , you know , what {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad F: Mmm . In the front - end we could do that .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So you just train {disfmarker} just different filters\nGrad F: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is\nGrad F: Yeah , I can imagine it would be {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD C: So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences .\nGrad F: I mean I guess there 's some {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD A: So in other words right ,\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: so\nGrad E: It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that . I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other I don't think that gives you any information .\nPhD C: Well it 's just as easy to {disfmarker} to give you the sixteen K individual ,\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: it was just more disk space you know for storing them\nProfessor B: Are you {disfmarker} are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ?\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: Mel cepstrum .\nProfessor B: So probably doesn't matter .\nPhD C: Well we could try .\nGrad F: There 's {disfmarker} there 's your answer .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but it wouldn't hurt to try ,\nPhD C: Could easily try\nPhD A: That 's what I would assume but you never know ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nPhD C: so\nPhD A: you know .\nProfessor B: Sure . No the reason I say this\nPostdoc G: Just {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not {disfmarker} b you wouldn't expect to be so much but\nPhD C: Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti stick them somewhere\nGrad F: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really not a problem .\nPhD A: Actually , no .\nPhD C: and I 'll rerun it with\nPhD A: Don't stop . Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters ,\nGrad F: Keep going . Yeah .\nPhD A: so shouldn't use {disfmarker} you should s you know , get\nGrad F: Yeah , I mean I 'll {disfmarker} I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same ,\nPhD C: OK .\nPhD A:  Right .\nGrad F: it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: Right . Right .\nGrad F: and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory ,\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: I mean I corrected all {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad F: that 's not a problem .\nPhD C: I mean I hand - edited the whole {disfmarker} the whole meeting so that can be run it 's just {disfmarker} Once we get the {disfmarker} the bug out .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPostdoc G: One {disfmarker} one question which is I {disfmarker} I had the impression {comment} from this {disfmarker} from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring ,\nPhD A: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc G: is that I thought that in order to\nGrad E: Yep .\nPostdoc G: so it was {disfmarker} so it 's like there 's already down\nGrad E: There 's one level that 's already happening right here .\nProfessor B: This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs\nPostdoc G: OK .\nGrad E: Right .\nGrad F: Oh .\nGrad E: And it gets downsampled to sixteen .\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nPhD C: And that 's actually said in your meeting ,\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc G: Oh OK .\nPhD C: that 's how I know that .\nPostdoc G: That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} It 's like are we downsampling to sixteen ?\nProfessor B: It 's a digital audio orientation for the board\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor B: it 's in the monitor so it 's\nPhD C: Thank God it 's not {vocalsound} more than that .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And I have no idea what filter it 's using ,\nGrad F: Is eight kilohertz {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ?\nGrad E: so\nProfessor B: For telephone stuff .\nGrad E: Telephone .\nPhD D: Telephone .\nGrad F: Yeah that 's what I was gonna say , I mean like {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database\nGrad F: so Oh , I see , so .\nProfessor B: and so that was a standard for that sixteen s\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing .\nProfessor B: Sixteen is more common for {disfmarker} for uh broadband stuff that isn't {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: That isn't music .\nProfessor B: that isn't music and isn't telephone ,\nPhD C: And I guess if you 're comparing like {disfmarker} uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: Why is that ?\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: right ? Well I don I mean if it 's any better\nProfessor B: No actually I would think that you would {disfmarker} you would get better {disfmarker} you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike .\nGrad E: All the way around I 'd think .\nProfessor B: Uh but who knows ? I mean we do {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna find all this stuff out ,\nPhD C: Yeah well we could try it .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: we don't know .\nGrad E: We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans .\nPhD C: OK . Yeah .\nProfessor B: Uh yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um well {disfmarker} well it 's sort of related but um good news also uh I got {disfmarker} well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on {disfmarker} on\nPhD A: They 're less animated .\nPhD C: Well but he has fewer {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he won't have more than eight and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU , so that sounds interesting . As a compliment to our front - end meeting\nGrad E: Dot EDU ?\nPhD C: and um so that 's gonna start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it or {disfmarker} or put a {vocalsound} push a button or something when they wanna make a note about \" oh boy you should probably erase those last few \" or uh \" wait I want this not to be recorded now \" or uh something like that s\nProfessor B: Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ?\nPostdoc G: The cross pads ?\nGrad E: Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads .\nPhD C: Cuz I was thinking you know if {disfmarker} if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know um and this came up talking to {disfmarker} to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate {disfmarker} to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: so I don't know if anyone has ideas or {disfmarker} you could even write down \" oh it 's about three twenty five and \" {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Well what I was just suggesting is {disfmarker} is we have these {disfmarker} this cross pad just for this purpose\nGrad E: Yeah , and use that .\nProfessor B: and just use that\nGrad E: Not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: and if we sink it in {disfmarker}\nPhD C: That would be great .\nProfessor B: The other thing is eh\nPhD C: That be great .\nProfessor B: I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ?\nGrad E: I don't know . I don't know . I 'll send mail to Dan and ask . I {disfmarker} I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it 's one board with two digital channels .\nProfessor B: Oh it is one board .\nGrad E: E eight each . So it {disfmarker} it takes two fibers in to the one board . And so w I think if we wanna do that {disfmarker} more than that we 'd have to have two boards , and then you have the synchronization issue .\nProfessor B: But that 's a question because that would {disfmarker} if it was possible cuz it is i you know already we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor B: and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store , right it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD D: What is the limit on each of those f fiber channels , is it the\nGrad E: Eight .\nPhD D: It just {disfmarker} it 's eight channels come in , does it have do with the sampling rate ?\nGrad E: It 's eight . I have no idea . But each {disfmarker} each fiber channel has eight {disfmarker} eight channels and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card .\nProfessor B: It might be a hard limitation ,\nGrad E: So\nProfessor B: I mean one thing is it {disfmarker} the whole thing as I said is {disfmarker} is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes requirements up a bit\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: but\nPhD D: I was just wondering if {disfmarker} if that could change .\nGrad E: I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff .\nPhD D: If we could drop that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: So I {disfmarker} I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK on the uh are we done with that ? So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes , so I got a quote um We can fit {disfmarker} we have room for one more wireless and the wireless , this unit here is three fifty {disfmarker} three hundred fifty dollars , it {disfmarker} I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner {disfmarker} the receiver {disfmarker} the other end , that 's uh four thirty um and then also\nPhD C: For {disfmarker} for each ?\nPhD D: Wow .\nPhD C: I mean the tuner is four thirty for each .\nGrad E: Yep .\nPhD C: Wow .\nGrad E: And we just need one more so {disfmarker} so\nProfessor B: Yeah at least w we got the good ones .\nGrad E: Yeah . So that 's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these .\nProfessor B: Yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony\nPhD D: Oh .\nGrad E: believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset .\nPostdoc G: Mmm .\nGrad E: So if we wanna use a different set {disfmarker} headset the solution that the guy suggested and they {disfmarker} apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . And that 's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece and the {disfmarker} he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece .\nProfessor B: There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in , you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ?\nGrad E: Becau - the reason is the only {disfmarker} only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector .\nProfessor B: No I understand . The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this .\nGrad E: Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us ,\nPhD D: Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too ,\nGrad E: so .\nProfessor B: Well\nPhD D: they 'd\nProfessor B: no they 'll just charge us more , so it 's {disfmarker} this\nPhD D: Mmm .\nGrad E: So {disfmarker} so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?\nProfessor B: Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .\nGrad E: So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: And {disfmarker} and see if that works .\nProfessor B: And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more .\nPhD C: Comfort .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK it 's just the {disfmarker} the\nGrad E: Right , it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD C: Could make our own handbands and\nGrad E: Um , and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA and so it will take about a week to get here .\nProfessor B: Yeah well it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um so OK to just go order ?\nProfessor B: We 're in this for the long term , yeah . Just order it .\nGrad E: OK\nPhD C: It 's a lot of money for a handband .\nGrad E: and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: cuz I think that 's how we did it before .\nProfessor B: Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a long time to get from LA .\nGrad E: OK . And then nine channels is the maximum we can do , so .\nProfessor B: Uh y right cuz {disfmarker} so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen\nGrad E: Without getting more stuff .\nProfessor B: and there 's six on the table so that 's nine .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Can I ask a really dumb question ?\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is there any way we can have you know like a {disfmarker} a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk that {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Probably .\nProfessor B: That 's a good idea .\nPhD C: I mean {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: That 's not a dumb question , it 's a good idea ,\nPhD C: Well I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing ,\nProfessor B: yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the\nGrad F: That 's like the Conch .\nPhD C: Well but {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Like at conferences\nPhD A: you know r\nPhD C: well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people\nGrad F: See , look .\nPhD C: um and I don't know identifying somehow ?\nPhD D: so nail the chairs down .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , somehow .\nPhD C: You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer .\nGrad E: It 's not a bad idea .\nProfessor B: No that {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} no\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: that 's a very {disfmarker} if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work .\nPhD D: The Springer mike .\nPhD C: I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that .\nProfessor B: Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: A hand - held , yeah .\nProfessor B: that 's a good idea\nPhD D: Infinite expansion .\nProfessor B: Right . Kind of rules out overlap but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but uh\nPhD C: Well or also for you know if people are not\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: Well we could just hand around the lapel .\nProfessor B: Uh no {disfmarker} no that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Rather than get a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No not the lapel .\nGrad E: do you want a handset ?\nProfessor B: No .\nGrad E: Well I mean is the {disfmarker} is the hand - held really any better ?\nPhD D: Liz hates the lapel .\nProfessor B: Yes .\nPhD C: I don't know\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: but I d I know the lapel is really suboptimal .\nProfessor B: No it {disfmarker} no it depends on the hand - held\nGrad E: Is awful ?\nProfessor B: but hand {disfmarker} many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it {disfmarker} it is less uh susceptible to hand noises . If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Right . I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of OK .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so\nGrad E: So I wonder if they have one that will hook up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . They have {disfmarker} What ?\nGrad E: I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves .\nPhD D: Well , you wouldn't want it to hook there you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room , right ?\nProfessor B: No that 's uh {disfmarker} you need a transmitter .\nGrad E: What ?\nPhD D: Is th isn't that built into the mike ?\nProfessor B: Oh I see . Get a {disfmarker} get a different radio , yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless\nProfessor B: Yeah . But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .\nPhD D: Have a little antenna coming out the bottom .\nGrad E: It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike , isn't it ?\nPhD D: But then the mike has to h\nPhD A: Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of\nProfessor B: No no {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Right .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor B: so right , so this is a good point , so yeah you have these {disfmarker} these mikes with a little antenna on the end right ?\nGrad E: OK . And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?\nProfessor B: I don't know . You 'll have to check with them ,\nGrad E: OK I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll ask .\nProfessor B: yeah . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's a great idea\nPhD D: It 's just a frequency .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then just sort of have that as the {disfmarker} and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and {disfmarker} and uh\nPhD C: Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large {disfmarker} the larger the group the less interaction {disfmarker} the less people are talking um over each other {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Pretty soon .\nPhD D: Mmm , yeah .\nPhD C: it just {disfmarker} there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD A: Um Gotta go .\nProfessor B: Off you go , yeah .\nGrad E: OK so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?\nPostdoc G: I {disfmarker} I thought of some extra {disfmarker} a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention .\nGrad E: OK .\nPostdoc G: One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine\nGrad E: uh Yep ,\nPostdoc G: and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month , I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten .\nPhD C: Uh it 's great {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Pretty close ,\nPostdoc G: So they 're still working .\nProfessor B: that 's good .\nPhD C: I j and this {disfmarker} I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something\nPhD D: Wow .\nGrad E: that 's good .\nPhD C: so it 's really great\nPostdoc G: It 's working out , thanks .\nPhD C: It 's really great .\nPostdoc G: Thanks . And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data It 's sort of a {disfmarker} a little bit {disfmarker} a little bit\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nProfessor B: Super idea .\nGrad E: Yep , that 'd be very interesting .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things ,\nGrad F: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'd love to hear what they have to say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: that 's a great idea .\nPhD D: So if we got them to talk about this meeting , it would be a meta {disfmarker} meta meeting .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah , exa {vocalsound} exactly I guess {disfmarker} nested several layers ,\nProfessor B: Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us\nPostdoc G: but\nProfessor B: so how do we do this , is the only thing .\nPhD C: Or just have them talk amongst themselves .\nPhD D: Have them have their own meeting .\nPhD C: And have\nPostdoc G: Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,\nProfessor B: Oh .\nPostdoc G: yeah . Have them talk about the data and they {disfmarker} and they 've made observations to me\nPhD C: that would be great .\nPostdoc G: like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , you know it 's part of it 's {disfmarker} it 's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .\nPhD C: That 's a great idea .\nGrad E: Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Be great .\nProfessor B: So maybe we could {disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it\nPostdoc G: OK .\nProfessor B: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Give us a status .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPostdoc G: Oh good . OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\nGrad E: That would be weird .\nPostdoc G: What {disfmarker} what yeah that 's right .\nPhD C: and I think that 's a good idea ,\nPostdoc G: Yeah exactly , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: get them involved .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nPhD C: Um that 's a great idea .\nPostdoc G: Great .\nProfessor B: Super .\nPhD C: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and {disfmarker} and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would {disfmarker} and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S\nProfessor B: OK .\nPostdoc G: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So\nGrad E: Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?\nPostdoc G: yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .\nProfessor B: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?\nPostdoc G: Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , I think just adds {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Alright .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Um good .\nPostdoc G: Thank you though , uh - huh .\nProfessor B: So maybe do digits and recess ?\nGrad E: Unless there 's anything else ?\nPostdoc G: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D: Do digital ones ?\nProfessor B: Uh OK .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nGrad E: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?\nProfessor B: Yeah . No I don't think it 's confusing . Well , it doesn't confuse me .\nPostdoc G: When we do this in the key {disfmarker} in the key {disfmarker} in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,\nPhD D: Does it mess up the forms ?\nPostdoc G: right ?\nGrad E: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free {disfmarker} free form .\nPostdoc G: Well i have a time mark .\nPhD D: The on switch is here on the {disfmarker} on the top there .\nPostdoc G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK .\nGrad E: And just clip it to your collar .\nProfessor B: That 's fine .\nGrad J: OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .\nGrad E: Great .\nGrad J: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be {disfmarker} I 'll be working on this .\nGrad E: And are you staying at Berkeley or is {disfmarker} are you just here a semester ?\nGrad J: This is my second semester and last .\nGrad E: Ah second and last ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad J: So I leave\nProfessor B: He 's in the {disfmarker} he 's in the cour two two five D course .\nGrad J: Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course ,\nProfessor B: So , yeah .\nGrad J: yeah .\nGrad E: Good .\nPhD D: Welcome .\nPostdoc G: Then you {disfmarker} then you go back to Norway , that 's OK .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nGrad F: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the {vocalsound} echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool .\nGrad J: Yeah .\nProfessor B: OK ,\nGrad E: Digits ?\nProfessor B: let 's do digits . OK .\nGrad E: And stop .", "answers": ["The group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data. Recognition performance was very good, indicating promising results for forced alignment procedures and the ability to analyze other important signal information, e.g. prosody and overlapping speech. It was decided that close-talking data should be downsampled and fed to the SRI recognizer to compare recognition performance, and that data from the far-field microphones should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible. The group also discussed recording setup and equipment issues. "], "pred": " What was the general discussion? Answer: What was the general discussion? Answer: What was the general discussion?

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Uh fourth meeting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We have to do what ?\nProject Manager: Some extra deciding .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} W what ? Alri alright . We'll see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: And the video button . The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .\nProject Manager: Well if I look at it , the side the side view {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , at the back {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then you can add suggestions .\nProject Manager: Oh yeah alright . Yeah {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I I don't want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ?\nUser Interface: No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the back . Yeah . {vocalsound} We thought about {disfmarker} Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . {vocalsound} And we thought about the logo big in the middle .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe that's too much\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way .\nUser Interface: No I don't think {disfmarker} And the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: That's basically what we were thinking about ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: W\nUser Interface: And about the side view um {disfmarker} This the front won't be as thick ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I see , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course ,\nProject Manager: Well . Yeah I see it .\nIndustrial Designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .\nUser Interface: Well , it won't be visible . Mm ?\nProject Manager: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Why ? {vocalsound} Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mean uh the the the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: {gap} If y {vocalsound} If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} In the middle in the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: You you have it a bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .\nProject Manager: And how large is it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , that's the question .\nIndustrial Designer: That's the question .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well {disfmarker} Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? {gap} This was Mike's prototype ,\nProject Manager: Well uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it .\nProject Manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: But now you have a totally different {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well , they lay there all the time .\nIndustrial Designer: The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They the the the the the side view ,\nIndustrial Designer: Side ? Uh oh the side ?\nProject Manager: we didn't uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we we he drew the s the side ,\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But you you hold it like this .\nUser Interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it ,\nIndustrial Designer: You're not holding it like this or something .\nUser Interface: you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this .\nProject Manager: No no no .\nIndustrial Designer: You have it more like this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way .\nMarketing: Like you're holding your telephone .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .\nUser Interface: Hmm . That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree on this .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No but but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree\nProject Manager: Yeah well\nUser Interface: and only Nils {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .\nUser Interface: But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . So uh I c I c\nIndustrial Designer: If necessary .\nProject Manager: Well , we'll we we'll do it like this .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable .\nProject Manager: No {disfmarker} No ,\nIndustrial Designer: But do you\nProject Manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} In the market uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think .\nProject Manager: No not totally .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Not totally , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh {vocalsound} every everyone into account . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: And you might be uh {disfmarker} You might be target customer .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't know .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we don't know ,\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe a thousand people ,\nProject Manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research .\nIndustrial Designer: or a million people .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Let it be .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . So that's that .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh any other suggestions ?\nProject Manager: No , I think it's great .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But what about the redesigning ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Comes to that later .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um you . Uh c You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Walter . {vocalsound} You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You're very personal again .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Great .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's more useful than just {vocalsound} speaking .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , this is just a short intro .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this .\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I know , but {vocalsound} I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire .\nProject Manager: To the customers ?\nIndustrial Designer: So and we ha we have answer now ?\nProject Manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , but I can't can s\nProject Manager: Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: But um {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but uh , you know {disfmarker} We dis we di {vocalsound} we designed it to be perfect .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we {vocalsound} we know where we stand .\nProject Manager: Well , one .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten .\nProject Manager: Well so it's point four . Easy to find t\nIndustrial Designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right , so {disfmarker} Right . Uh is it good-looking ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well , I guess uh I think uh {vocalsound} it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . {gap}\nProject Manager: Two . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um {vocalsound} uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: The titanium might be uh f for older people .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It you put uh put a black front on it or something .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh no . {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also {disfmarker} Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and not only for youth uh young people .\nUser Interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . I totally agree .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , the fourteen yeah .\nProject Manager: We we have to get get on , go through this .\nMarketing: Right , a number please .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so .\nMarketing: So the last one is seven .\nUser Interface: Um , no it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Easy to change channels ?\nProject Manager: No , not false . It's one .\nMarketing: Oh , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nProject Manager: Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it {gap} .\nMarketing: Change channels ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: So I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . You {disfmarker} How can you make it any easier ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} With two huge buttons .\nMarketing: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , huge is a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nMarketing: Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?\nProject Manager: Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s\nUser Interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well six then . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: because of the colour . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Six ? Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so ,\nProject Manager: Are the functions easy to learn ?\nIndustrial Designer: but um um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} We have so few functions , so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nUser Interface: Well , I should {disfmarker} I think two ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: because {vocalsound} the voice recorder is n not self learning . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Alright . Two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , but just do some {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} We we {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I th I th I think this is too time consuming .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we take too much time ?\nProject Manager: Uh not not towards you ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: but towards this all .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Th this is {gap} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: We you have to put it to the customers .\nMarketing: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? {vocalsound} R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nProject Manager: Uh well well a bit , so four .\nMarketing: Four . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , very much . One .\nProject Manager: One . And features included also one . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Device fancy feeling .\nIndustrial Designer: And I think fancy-feeling too ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , cool man .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the titanium back . Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's great .\nProject Manager: Is the device easy to use ?\nUser Interface: The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes we have {vocalsound} not many buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: So well maybe two\nProject Manager: Two , three .\nUser Interface: Two {vocalsound} two .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the voice recorder .\nMarketing: Well , with the uh {disfmarker} Three .\nProject Manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?\nUser Interface: T\nIndustrial Designer: F\nProject Manager: Well in our covers , in our fronts .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So yes , one .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . One or two . Yeah .\nUser Interface: One or two , another two .\nMarketing: Nah f four I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Four ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} If you look at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Oh okay . Okay {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well three .\nMarketing: Three , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can also have {gap} front with uh with fruit on it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , that's true .\nProject Manager: Is the material attractive ?\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: This is the last meeting ?\nProject Manager: Yes , but we we have to design much more ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: The average will uh come later .\nProject Manager: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly .\nProject Manager: Oh . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point .\nIndustrial Designer: My god .\nProject Manager: I had to fit it in .\nMarketing: It has to go to twelve , right ?\nProject Manager: I twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four .\nIndustrial Designer: The what ?\nProject Manager: The sample speaker ,\nIndustrial Designer: The {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Out .\nProject Manager: the s sensor .\nMarketing: That's easy . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: Kick it out .\nUser Interface: The what ?\nProject Manager: We have to go to twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Yeah . The speaker .\nProject Manager: The speaker costs far , by far the most .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option .\nMarketing: That's some wrong info , man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It it isn't worth it .\nIndustrial Designer: No . No , d th No .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: We could make two different versions , one with and one without .\nMarketing: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But for this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's just extra . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: So , zero .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we go to fourteen point six .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually .\nMarketing: What more ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Batteries are uh quite {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh no , no no no .\nProject Manager: w a remote control has a battery .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think .\nUser Interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nMarketing: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Can't we do that with a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: Why not ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh that uh y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: because my information says it .\nProject Manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yeah . Regular is normal .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And simple ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Simple .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nothing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Elementary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Your part .\nIndustrial Designer: I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report .\nProject Manager: What happens if we do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Single {disfmarker} Well you have to use a chip . So {disfmarker} Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: How much do we win ? One .\nUser Interface: We we we {disfmarker} Why ?\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: We have very little options furthermore , for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface: Uh well we have to put that in .\nMarketing: Yeah , we need to have the {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: That that's a fact . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there ,\nMarketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but it's only one half .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Nah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it d it doesn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , that's n It's not relevant .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah , you must change the chip uh back .\nProject Manager: then you s then you only have one half left .\nUser Interface: You must change the chip back , Nils .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nMarketing: No , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Then the whole concept is uh\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} we oh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} You can make you can make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: You have to use it .\nMarketing: But if you don't sell\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? No , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Y we don't need both .\nProject Manager: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Says {gap} .\nProject Manager: Says , his {disfmarker} Uh that was in the second meeting , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I I did single curve to {disfmarker} Well you said s double curved ,\nUser Interface: I ?\nProject Manager: uh he ,\nUser Interface: {gap} ?\nProject Manager: because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We can also make it flat .\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} No\nIndustrial Designer: But what what did what do n\nMarketing: no no no .\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What do they mean with the curves ?\nProject Manager: Curved ?\nIndustrial Designer: Is th Is this a curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes , that's curved .\nIndustrial Designer: One curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .\nProject Manager: No , it's one curve .\nIndustrial Designer: It's how you {disfmarker} It's how you look at it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} One curve . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: One curve , simple .\nIndustrial Designer: Well then we have a huge problem I think .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: We have a big financial problem .\nUser Interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy .\nProject Manager: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But {disfmarker} Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah or we could replace it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you if you make it cool to have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: By the way , we also have this one .\nMarketing: Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: Oh , costs nothing . That's nice . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .\nProject Manager: Plastic is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes , but I just got it .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well that's pretty uh l\nUser Interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium ,\nMarketing: That is pretty stupid . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: N not very practical . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: uh titanium-coloured plastic ?\nProject Manager: Who ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You want to dump the titanium ?\nUser Interface: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper .\nProject Manager: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But I'm n I don't agree .\nUser Interface: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again .\nIndustrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .\nUser Interface: Ah no no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same .\nProject Manager: No , I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Well , I do think so .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Y\nProject Manager: Yes . And the feel ,\nUser Interface: {gap} feel .\nProject Manager: and th that it is strong , and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people .\nProject Manager: We still {vocalsound} we had to focus to get more people from the younger group ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but not lose the one {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think the titanium is very important .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then .\nUser Interface: We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think .\nMarketing: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Well what else ?\nUser Interface: No , nothing .\nIndustrial Designer: W I mean uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or you shou {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Amen .\nMarketing: Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Because you have lots of functions {vocalsound} in it too .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well yeah . Alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Why can't I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I agree with that . So we u we use uh {disfmarker} Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic .\nProject Manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back .\nProject Manager: I I'll talk to the managers . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No no no no . W Titanium stays there .\nProject Manager: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah this is good ,\nMarketing: Osl {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but it it's not good enough . {vocalsound} So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .\nProject Manager: Ah those {gap} those account managers , what do th d what do they know ?\nUser Interface: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Come on . Riot . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: What do we {disfmarker} Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes , yes .\nUser Interface: No because we did not know anything about it .\nProject Manager: One and a half Euros . Hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah al alright , yeah .\nMarketing: If you don't have the money , you can't make it .\nIndustrial Designer: But we have to deal with it now . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive .\nProject Manager: So ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So we have to make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: Titanium gone and add plastic .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but then we've got money left .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?\nProject Manager: Well , no it's just uh all plastic .\nIndustrial Designer: No {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well alright . Huh .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh six . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's just free , man .\nIndustrial Designer: A lot of plastic , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Four . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: No two for the to make it clear .\nProject Manager: But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And we still have money left .\nUser Interface: Yeah . W\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do we want , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: I want gold plating .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No no um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah right . I want chrome . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I think uh the case is double curved then .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Because you y have that curve\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have we have to uh fill {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and you have that curve .\nProject Manager: Y Oh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well , th that that is the problem .\nUser Interface: Yeah well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we ha {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: No no no , but th that's not f um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Safe .\nUser Interface: Well y we have curves in all directions .\nIndustrial Designer: Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped ,\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} alright .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so it it can be done . {vocalsound} But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven .\nProject Manager: Finance ?\nUser Interface: I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it .\nProject Manager: Well , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Guys ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We have to dump our titanium ,\nMarketing: Shoot .\nProject Manager: and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Objection .\nUser Interface: Pro project . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project . {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I think it's uh {disfmarker} Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , me too .\nProject Manager: That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason ,\nIndustrial Designer: Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: And uh unrealistic .\nProject Manager: but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .\nUser Interface: Well we we we used our creativity ,\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: but we just had to adapt it to the costs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Which isn't very practical ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nei . Uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but {vocalsound} that's the way .\nProject Manager: Well , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh leadership next .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Terrible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh teamwork ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leadership .\nUser Interface: Leadership ? Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It was very democratic . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh yeah well {vocalsound} I think so also .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But o alright , the teamwork ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess .\nProject Manager: No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Right yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah , think so too .\nProject Manager: Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It was a complete disaster .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} Uh it it it uh it is uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen .\nProject Manager: It's also a It's both the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Or not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard .\nProject Manager: I liked this SMARTboard ,\nIndustrial Designer: That's the digital panel .\nProject Manager: but I hated that one .\nMarketing: This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ?\nProject Manager: Well it's both a SMARTboard .\nIndustrial Designer: That's that's the smart\nMarketing: Yeah right . B but you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh they're both SMARTboards . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: This is just a large t large television .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A televi Yeah .\nMarketing: You u you use the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .\nMarketing: Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , wi w which one did you like ?\nUser Interface: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Left or right ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That one isn't accurate . {vocalsound} It just doesn't work .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .\nMarketing: You can {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes . Th that is so .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I didn't use uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the {vocalsound} these th\nProject Manager: We're now talking about the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't need a SMARTboard .\nUser Interface: {gap} Well we we used that one ,\nIndustrial Designer: Nei It it's much m {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we needed it . I think .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an {disfmarker} I I like it .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay , alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh you can uh {disfmarker} I I sent it about three times now . Uh {vocalsound} a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah , it is .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The simple uh sch school board .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I agree .\nProject Manager: And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ?\nIndustrial Designer: I I didn't use it .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop .\nProject Manager: I used it uh just to check it out , but uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself ,\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} It isn't practical . Right .\nProject Manager: and then you're going to send it , yeah . Well , no .\nIndustrial Designer: W {vocalsound} But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block .\nMarketing: Your notepad . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's , no , it it's useless .\nUser Interface: Well I I drew this . {gap} Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah alright . For drawings ,\nProject Manager: For drawings , yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: but not for personal notes . I think that's not very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} N notes mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I mean {vocalsound} you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: If you've {disfmarker} If you've {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict {disfmarker} Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I understand .\nMarketing: That Stefan use .\nIndustrial Designer: But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . {vocalsound} You can't {disfmarker} It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . It's it's only useful if you have to draw something .\nUser Interface: Yeah . But then uh it's really useful , I think .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep . Alright . Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mu Yeah right .\nProject Manager: Of course great .\nMarketing: Yeah , great . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Can we keep them ? Uh .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: B by my {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wireless uh wireless things .\nUser Interface: Thanks Project Manager . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Other uh things we used here ? I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well these chairs , man . {vocalsound} Really great .\nIndustrial Designer: Well did you really uh {disfmarker} Did you really take uh take those in account ? {vocalsound} I {vocalsound} half of time I didn't notice they were there . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No . I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . {vocalsound} I don't care about it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we shouldn't talk about that .\nUser Interface: Well I did .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Because {vocalsound} this is a realistic environment .\nProject Manager: Well w why not ? Uh etcetera {gap} {disfmarker} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} N new ideas found ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule {vocalsound} {disfmarker} What ? {vocalsound} For future um meetings {vocalsound} you have got ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I missed uh the option to uh to email ,\nMarketing: Communicate in between .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: Chatting and emailing .\nUser Interface: Email or chat or something .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , right . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but that's one n new idea . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: Well , new ideas found by this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Not . Nothing .\nMarketing: Well , more more information in the beginning .\nProject Manager: We don't want this . We hate this .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Digital pen is useless . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No it isn't .\nProject Manager: Yeah , for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . So it isn't useless .\nProject Manager: But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker} No {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's still an expensive uh expensive {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Because this is huge\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: uh this v very very uh expensive paper .\nUser Interface: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: With the mouse it is {disfmarker} No . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: But if w Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Well and if {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching .\nUser Interface: Uh indeed .\nIndustrial Designer: And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? {vocalsound} A\nProject Manager: Well no . I hated to draw like that . You you can't draw anything uh neat .\nIndustrial Designer: Really ?\nMarketing: Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , {vocalsound} yeah , very precise {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Anything you want . Any b b Yeah . L li li\nProject Manager: I if it if it would be perfect following .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green {gap} uh {gap} school board .\nIndustrial Designer: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is uh is {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , mu\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , board , a school board , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I it has {disfmarker} It is useful . Yeah .\nMarketing: It saves time .\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work ,\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I think then it's pretty useful .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then you can save it immediately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , they are now .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: Celebration .\nProject Manager: It is . So , congratulations crew .\nIndustrial Designer: Did you type that ?\nUser Interface: Hmm . Celebration . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Se {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our {vocalsound} newly earned money . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Finally my beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map .\nUser Interface: But Nils you've got some work left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what you have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: Map , is it a good word ? The folder , yeah .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I have to go to a physiotherapy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh it worked . Two times quick . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Wow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So it is useful , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} It is handy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} This is nice .\nIndustrial Designer: No but uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh great , man .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .\nIndustrial Designer: Radical . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: D design .\nIndustrial Designer: Do you believe it yourself ?\nProject Manager: S Oh . He saved them all ten . Well alright . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well they they wanted everything we produced , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} My big bird . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Your big beautiful bird .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where is this {gap} ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of or the other way around uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you are broken .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I think so too .\nUser Interface: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know . I think she's listening . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I also think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Who is she you're talking about ?\nProject Manager: She already knows . She ? Big brother .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach .\nProject Manager: Our manager .\nIndustrial Designer: Is she also our accountant ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Close your laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Because then we have to confront her with our {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So she can see we're ready .\nMarketing: I feel watched . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics ,\nUser Interface: Yeah . Let's take this remote into uh production .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but we couldn't because of the costs . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That that's the title of our uh end document .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: That that's our new slogan .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Blame our accountants .\nMarketing: Do that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's a nice title . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we couldn't , yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Very catching . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I th Yeah .\nMarketing: I'm sure management would like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: She's on the move .\nProject Manager: I'm going to resign after this project anyway , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the Project Manager's perspective on the prototype.\nAnswer:", "input": "Summarize the Project Manager's perspective on the prototype.", "context": "Project Manager: Uh fourth meeting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: We have to do what ?\nProject Manager: Some extra deciding .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} W what ? Alri alright . We'll see .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I think it is .\nProject Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .\nProject Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .\nIndustrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .\nIndustrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or one of us will ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: It's a double R_ .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .\nProject Manager: Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\nUser Interface: Oval yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m\nUser Interface: Channel up and volume ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nUser Interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: And the video button . The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .\nProject Manager: Well if I look at it , the side the side view {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well , at the back {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then you can add suggestions .\nProject Manager: Oh yeah alright . Yeah {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I I don't want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ?\nUser Interface: No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah the back . Yeah . {vocalsound} We thought about {disfmarker} Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . {vocalsound} And we thought about the logo big in the middle .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe that's too much\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way .\nUser Interface: No I don't think {disfmarker} And the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: That's basically what we were thinking about ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: W\nUser Interface: And about the side view um {disfmarker} This the front won't be as thick ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I see , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course ,\nProject Manager: Well . Yeah I see it .\nIndustrial Designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .\nUser Interface: Well , it won't be visible . Mm ?\nProject Manager: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Why ? {vocalsound} Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: mean uh the the the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: {gap} If y {vocalsound} If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} In the middle in the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: You you have it a bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .\nProject Manager: And how large is it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , that's the question .\nIndustrial Designer: That's the question .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well {disfmarker} Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? {gap} This was Mike's prototype ,\nProject Manager: Well uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it .\nProject Manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: But now you have a totally different {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well , they lay there all the time .\nIndustrial Designer: The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They the the the the the side view ,\nIndustrial Designer: Side ? Uh oh the side ?\nProject Manager: we didn't uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we we he drew the s the side ,\nUser Interface: Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But you you hold it like this .\nUser Interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it ,\nIndustrial Designer: You're not holding it like this or something .\nUser Interface: you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this .\nProject Manager: No no no .\nIndustrial Designer: You have it more like this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way .\nMarketing: Like you're holding your telephone .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .\nUser Interface: Hmm . That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree on this .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No but but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree\nProject Manager: Yeah well\nUser Interface: and only Nils {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .\nUser Interface: But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . So uh I c I c\nIndustrial Designer: If necessary .\nProject Manager: Well , we'll we we'll do it like this .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable .\nProject Manager: No {disfmarker} No ,\nIndustrial Designer: But do you\nProject Manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} In the market uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think .\nProject Manager: No not totally .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Not totally , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh {vocalsound} every everyone into account . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: And you might be uh {disfmarker} You might be target customer .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: We don't know .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we don't know ,\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe a thousand people ,\nProject Manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research .\nIndustrial Designer: or a million people .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Let it be .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . So that's that .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh any other suggestions ?\nProject Manager: No , I think it's great .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: But what about the redesigning ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Comes to that later .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um you . Uh c You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Walter . {vocalsound} You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You're very personal again .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Great .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's more useful than just {vocalsound} speaking .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , this is just a short intro .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this .\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I know , but {vocalsound} I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire .\nProject Manager: To the customers ?\nIndustrial Designer: So and we ha we have answer now ?\nProject Manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , but I can't can s\nProject Manager: Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: But um {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but uh , you know {disfmarker} We dis we di {vocalsound} we designed it to be perfect .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we {vocalsound} we know where we stand .\nProject Manager: Well , one .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten .\nProject Manager: Well so it's point four . Easy to find t\nIndustrial Designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right , so {disfmarker} Right . Uh is it good-looking ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well , I guess uh I think uh {vocalsound} it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . {gap}\nProject Manager: Two . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um {vocalsound} uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: The titanium might be uh f for older people .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It you put uh put a black front on it or something .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh no . {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also {disfmarker} Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: and not only for youth uh young people .\nUser Interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . I totally agree .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , the fourteen yeah .\nProject Manager: We we have to get get on , go through this .\nMarketing: Right , a number please .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so .\nMarketing: So the last one is seven .\nUser Interface: Um , no it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Easy to change channels ?\nProject Manager: No , not false . It's one .\nMarketing: Oh , sorry .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nProject Manager: Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it {gap} .\nMarketing: Change channels ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: So I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . You {disfmarker} How can you make it any easier ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} With two huge buttons .\nMarketing: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , huge is a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nMarketing: Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?\nProject Manager: Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s\nUser Interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well six then . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: because of the colour . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Six ? Right .\nIndustrial Designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so ,\nProject Manager: Are the functions easy to learn ?\nIndustrial Designer: but um um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} We have so few functions , so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nUser Interface: Well , I should {disfmarker} I think two ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: because {vocalsound} the voice recorder is n not self learning . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Alright . Two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , but just do some {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} We we {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I th I th I think this is too time consuming .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we take too much time ?\nProject Manager: Uh not not towards you ,\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: but towards this all .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Th this is {gap} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: We you have to put it to the customers .\nMarketing: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? {vocalsound} R_S_I_ sensitive ?\nProject Manager: Uh well well a bit , so four .\nMarketing: Four . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , very much . One .\nProject Manager: One . And features included also one . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Device fancy feeling .\nIndustrial Designer: And I think fancy-feeling too ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , cool man .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the titanium back . Yeah .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's great .\nProject Manager: Is the device easy to use ?\nUser Interface: The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes we have {vocalsound} not many buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: So well maybe two\nProject Manager: Two , three .\nUser Interface: Two {vocalsound} two .\nIndustrial Designer: because of the voice recorder .\nMarketing: Well , with the uh {disfmarker} Three .\nProject Manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?\nUser Interface: T\nIndustrial Designer: F\nProject Manager: Well in our covers , in our fronts .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So yes , one .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . One or two . Yeah .\nUser Interface: One or two , another two .\nMarketing: Nah f four I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Four ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} If you look at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Oh okay . Okay {gap} .\nUser Interface: Well three .\nMarketing: Three , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: And you can also have {gap} front with uh with fruit on it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , that's true .\nProject Manager: Is the material attractive ?\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: This is the last meeting ?\nProject Manager: Yes , but we we have to design much more ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: The average will uh come later .\nProject Manager: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly .\nProject Manager: Oh . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point .\nIndustrial Designer: My god .\nProject Manager: I had to fit it in .\nMarketing: It has to go to twelve , right ?\nProject Manager: I twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four .\nIndustrial Designer: The what ?\nProject Manager: The sample speaker ,\nIndustrial Designer: The {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Out .\nProject Manager: the s sensor .\nMarketing: That's easy . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: Kick it out .\nUser Interface: The what ?\nProject Manager: We have to go to twelve and a half .\nMarketing: Yeah . The speaker .\nProject Manager: The speaker costs far , by far the most .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option .\nMarketing: That's some wrong info , man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It it isn't worth it .\nIndustrial Designer: No . No , d th No .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: We could make two different versions , one with and one without .\nMarketing: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But for this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It's just extra . Kick it out .\nProject Manager: So , zero .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we go to fourteen point six .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually .\nMarketing: What more ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Batteries are uh quite {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh no , no no no .\nProject Manager: w a remote control has a battery .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think .\nUser Interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah ?\nMarketing: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Can't we do that with a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nUser Interface: Why not ?\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh that uh y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: because my information says it .\nProject Manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yeah . Regular is normal .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And simple ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Simple .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nothing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Elementary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Your part .\nIndustrial Designer: I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report .\nProject Manager: What happens if we do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Single {disfmarker} Well you have to use a chip . So {disfmarker} Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager: How much do we win ? One .\nUser Interface: We we we {disfmarker} Why ?\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: We have very little options furthermore , for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface: Uh well we have to put that in .\nMarketing: Yeah , we need to have the {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: That that's a fact . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there ,\nMarketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but it's only one half .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Nah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it d it doesn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , that's n It's not relevant .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah , you must change the chip uh back .\nProject Manager: then you s then you only have one half left .\nUser Interface: You must change the chip back , Nils .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nMarketing: No , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Then the whole concept is uh\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} we oh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} You can make you can make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: You have to use it .\nMarketing: But if you don't sell\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? No , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Y we don't need both .\nProject Manager: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Says {gap} .\nProject Manager: Says , his {disfmarker} Uh that was in the second meeting , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well I I did single curve to {disfmarker} Well you said s double curved ,\nUser Interface: I ?\nProject Manager: uh he ,\nUser Interface: {gap} ?\nProject Manager: because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: We can also make it flat .\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} No\nIndustrial Designer: But what what did what do n\nMarketing: no no no .\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What do they mean with the curves ?\nProject Manager: Curved ?\nIndustrial Designer: Is th Is this a curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes , that's curved .\nIndustrial Designer: One curve ?\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .\nProject Manager: No , it's one curve .\nIndustrial Designer: It's how you {disfmarker} It's how you look at it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} One curve . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: One curve , simple .\nIndustrial Designer: Well then we have a huge problem I think .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .\nProject Manager: We have a big financial problem .\nUser Interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy .\nProject Manager: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But {disfmarker} Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah or we could replace it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you if you make it cool to have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: By the way , we also have this one .\nMarketing: Oh , that's just great .\nProject Manager: Oh , costs nothing . That's nice . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .\nProject Manager: Plastic is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes , but I just got it .\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well that's pretty uh l\nUser Interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium ,\nMarketing: That is pretty stupid . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: N not very practical . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: uh titanium-coloured plastic ?\nProject Manager: Who ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You want to dump the titanium ?\nUser Interface: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper .\nProject Manager: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But I'm n I don't agree .\nUser Interface: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again .\nIndustrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .\nUser Interface: Ah no no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same .\nProject Manager: No , I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Well , I do think so .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Y\nProject Manager: Yes . And the feel ,\nUser Interface: {gap} feel .\nProject Manager: and th that it is strong , and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people .\nProject Manager: We still {vocalsound} we had to focus to get more people from the younger group ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but not lose the one {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think the titanium is very important .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then .\nUser Interface: We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think .\nMarketing: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Well what else ?\nUser Interface: No , nothing .\nIndustrial Designer: W I mean uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Or you shou {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Amen .\nMarketing: Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Because you have lots of functions {vocalsound} in it too .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well yeah . Alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Why can't I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I agree with that . So we u we use uh {disfmarker} Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic .\nProject Manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back .\nProject Manager: I I'll talk to the managers . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No no no no . W Titanium stays there .\nProject Manager: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah this is good ,\nMarketing: Osl {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but it it's not good enough . {vocalsound} So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .\nProject Manager: Ah those {gap} those account managers , what do th d what do they know ?\nUser Interface: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Come on . Riot . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: What do we {disfmarker} Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes , yes .\nUser Interface: No because we did not know anything about it .\nProject Manager: One and a half Euros . Hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah al alright , yeah .\nMarketing: If you don't have the money , you can't make it .\nIndustrial Designer: But we have to deal with it now . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive .\nProject Manager: So ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So we have to make it cheaper .\nIndustrial Designer: Titanium gone and add plastic .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but then we've got money left .\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?\nProject Manager: Well , no it's just uh all plastic .\nIndustrial Designer: No {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well alright . Huh .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No yeah well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh six . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's just free , man .\nIndustrial Designer: A lot of plastic , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Four . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: No two for the to make it clear .\nProject Manager: But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And we still have money left .\nUser Interface: Yeah . W\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What do we want , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: I want gold plating .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No no um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah right . I want chrome . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I think uh the case is double curved then .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Because you y have that curve\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have we have to uh fill {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and you have that curve .\nProject Manager: Y Oh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well , th that that is the problem .\nUser Interface: Yeah well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: W we ha {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright .\nIndustrial Designer: No no no , but th that's not f um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Safe .\nUser Interface: Well y we have curves in all directions .\nIndustrial Designer: Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped ,\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} alright .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so it it can be done . {vocalsound} But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven .\nProject Manager: Finance ?\nUser Interface: I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it .\nProject Manager: Well , guys ?\nIndustrial Designer: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Guys ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We have to dump our titanium ,\nMarketing: Shoot .\nProject Manager: and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Objection .\nUser Interface: Pro project . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project . {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I think it's uh {disfmarker} Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , me too .\nProject Manager: That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason ,\nIndustrial Designer: Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: And uh unrealistic .\nProject Manager: but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .\nUser Interface: Well we we we used our creativity ,\nMarketing: Right .\nUser Interface: but we just had to adapt it to the costs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Which isn't very practical ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nei . Uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but {vocalsound} that's the way .\nProject Manager: Well , alright .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh leadership next .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Terrible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh teamwork ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Leadership .\nUser Interface: Leadership ? Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It was very democratic . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh yeah well {vocalsound} I think so also .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But o alright , the teamwork ?\nIndustrial Designer: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess .\nProject Manager: No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think .\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Right yeah . {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah , think so too .\nProject Manager: Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It was a complete disaster .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} Uh it it it uh it is uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen .\nProject Manager: It's also a It's both the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Or not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard .\nProject Manager: I liked this SMARTboard ,\nIndustrial Designer: That's the digital panel .\nProject Manager: but I hated that one .\nMarketing: This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ?\nProject Manager: Well it's both a SMARTboard .\nIndustrial Designer: That's that's the smart\nMarketing: Yeah right . B but you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh they're both SMARTboards . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: This is just a large t large television .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A televi Yeah .\nMarketing: You u you use the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .\nMarketing: Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well , wi w which one did you like ?\nUser Interface: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Left or right ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That one isn't accurate . {vocalsound} It just doesn't work .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .\nMarketing: You can {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes . Th that is so .\nIndustrial Designer: Well I didn't use uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the {vocalsound} these th\nProject Manager: We're now talking about the SMARTboards .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't need a SMARTboard .\nUser Interface: {gap} Well we we used that one ,\nIndustrial Designer: Nei It it's much m {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and we needed it . I think .\nMarketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an {disfmarker} I I like it .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay , alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh you can uh {disfmarker} I I sent it about three times now . Uh {vocalsound} a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah , it is .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: The simple uh sch school board .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I agree .\nProject Manager: And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ?\nIndustrial Designer: I I didn't use it .\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop .\nProject Manager: I used it uh just to check it out , but uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's the {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself ,\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} It isn't practical . Right .\nProject Manager: and then you're going to send it , yeah . Well , no .\nIndustrial Designer: W {vocalsound} But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block .\nMarketing: Your notepad . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's , no , it it's useless .\nUser Interface: Well I I drew this . {gap} Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah alright . For drawings ,\nProject Manager: For drawings , yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: but not for personal notes . I think that's not very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {gap} N notes mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I mean {vocalsound} you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: If you've {disfmarker} If you've {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict {disfmarker} Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I understand .\nMarketing: That Stefan use .\nIndustrial Designer: But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . {vocalsound} You can't {disfmarker} It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: No , I don't think so . It's it's only useful if you have to draw something .\nUser Interface: Yeah . But then uh it's really useful , I think .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep . Alright . Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mu Yeah right .\nProject Manager: Of course great .\nMarketing: Yeah , great . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Can we keep them ? Uh .\nProject Manager: Yeah . You can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: B by my {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wireless uh wireless things .\nUser Interface: Thanks Project Manager . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Other uh things we used here ? I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well these chairs , man . {vocalsound} Really great .\nIndustrial Designer: Well did you really uh {disfmarker} Did you really take uh take those in account ? {vocalsound} I {vocalsound} half of time I didn't notice they were there . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No . No . I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . {vocalsound} I don't care about it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But we shouldn't talk about that .\nUser Interface: Well I did .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Because {vocalsound} this is a realistic environment .\nProject Manager: Well w why not ? Uh etcetera {gap} {disfmarker} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} N new ideas found ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule {vocalsound} {disfmarker} What ? {vocalsound} For future um meetings {vocalsound} you have got ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well I missed uh the option to uh to email ,\nMarketing: Communicate in between .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: Chatting and emailing .\nUser Interface: Email or chat or something .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , right . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah alright , but that's one n new idea . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager: Well , new ideas found by this .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Not . Nothing .\nMarketing: Well , more more information in the beginning .\nProject Manager: We don't want this . We hate this .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Digital pen is useless . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No it isn't .\nProject Manager: Yeah , for drawings .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . So it isn't useless .\nProject Manager: But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well {disfmarker} No {disfmarker}\nMarketing: For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's still an expensive uh expensive {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Because this is huge\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: uh this v very very uh expensive paper .\nUser Interface: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .\nMarketing: Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface: With the mouse it is {disfmarker} No . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: But if w Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Well and if {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching .\nUser Interface: Uh indeed .\nIndustrial Designer: And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? {vocalsound} A\nProject Manager: Well no . I hated to draw like that . You you can't draw anything uh neat .\nIndustrial Designer: Really ?\nMarketing: Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , {vocalsound} yeah , very precise {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Anything you want . Any b b Yeah . L li li\nProject Manager: I if it if it would be perfect following .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green {gap} uh {gap} school board .\nIndustrial Designer: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is uh is {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , mu\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , board , a school board , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I it has {disfmarker} It is useful . Yeah .\nMarketing: It saves time .\nProject Manager: Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work ,\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I think then it's pretty useful .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And then you can save it immediately .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , they are now .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: Celebration .\nProject Manager: It is . So , congratulations crew .\nIndustrial Designer: Did you type that ?\nUser Interface: Hmm . Celebration . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Se {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our {vocalsound} newly earned money . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Finally my beer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well , that's it I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um I don't know how long we still have . {vocalsound} I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Well dunno . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well yeah , it is a bit uh {disfmarker} Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . {gap} I have to do that .\nUser Interface: {gap}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I {disfmarker} Di did you um save this one in the folder ?\nMarketing: You better get started . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Can you do that ?\nUser Interface: No . No no no no .\nIndustrial Designer: No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map .\nUser Interface: But Nils you've got some work left . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what you have to do .\nIndustrial Designer: Map , is it a good word ? The folder , yeah .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I have to go to a physiotherapy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh it worked . Two times quick . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Wow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So it is useful , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} It is handy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} This is nice .\nIndustrial Designer: No but uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh great , man .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .\nIndustrial Designer: Radical . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: D design .\nIndustrial Designer: Do you believe it yourself ?\nProject Manager: S Oh . He saved them all ten . Well alright . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Well they they wanted everything we produced , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} My big bird . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Your big beautiful bird .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where is this {gap} ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of or the other way around uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Maybe you are broken .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah I think so too .\nUser Interface: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You know . I think she's listening . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I also think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Who is she you're talking about ?\nProject Manager: She already knows . She ? Big brother .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach .\nProject Manager: Our manager .\nIndustrial Designer: Is she also our accountant ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nUser Interface: Close your laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Because then we have to confront her with our {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So she can see we're ready .\nMarketing: I feel watched . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad B: \nGrad D: How many batteries do you go through ?\nGrad B: Thank you .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: Sure .\nProfessor C: Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done .\nGrad E: Yeah , I think so too . Um . The {disfmarker} we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . \" It actually says , \" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So uh ,\nProfessor C: It doesn't know \" I \" .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: Um , the uh\nGrad B: Oh , Am Spartacus . \"\nGrad D: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it 's saying .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad B: Verstehe . OK .\nGrad D: I gue\nGrad E: The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this {disfmarker} uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some {disfmarker} some sentences . No , right ?\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , for a couple {disfmarker}\nGrad D: So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a {disfmarker} er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like {disfmarker} the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a {disfmarker} basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so it just starts {disfmarker} uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .\nGrad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the {disfmarker} the syntax trees for three or four .\nGrad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the {disfmarker} from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , \" noun goes to \" , you know , Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .\nGrad B: OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright .\nGrad E: And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we {disfmarker} we worked around that . The , uh {disfmarker} the system , um {disfmarker} I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was {disfmarker} It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .\nGrad D: Why {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in {disfmarker} in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,\nGrad E: You have to switch it on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \" , when I build the {disfmarker} built the tree .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: Like .\nProfessor C: So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: um\nGrad B: I {disfmarker} I still don't {disfmarker} I still don't really understand e like {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Well Tilman s\nGrad B: I mean we sort of say , um {disfmarker} You know , I {disfmarker} I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in {disfmarker} in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user , and then magically it sort of s\nProfessor C: Yeah {disfmarker}\nGrad B: I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ?\nProfessor C: I thi Yeah . So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group ,\nGrad B: R uh Sure .\nProfessor C: but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it .\nGrad B: Yeah , soon . OK .\nProfessor C: And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together .\nGrad B: That 's fine .\nProfessor C: It 's eee {comment} messy but once you understand it you understand it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} There 's nothing really complicated about it .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: No .\nGrad B: And I remember one thing that {disfmarker} that came up in the talk last Wednesday . Um , was this , I {disfmarker} I think he talked about the idea of like , um {disfmarker} He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of {disfmarker} for each word you , um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK , you know how to do it ?\nGrad B: For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . That 's , you know , that 's {disfmarker} that 's HPSG or whatever .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Now , we 're {disfmarker} we 're not committed for our research to {pause} do any of those things .\nGrad B: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So uh we are committed for our funding .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: OK ? to {pause} uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Make our stuff fit to that .\nProfessor C: Yeah , to {disfmarker} n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need .\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: OK ? So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great .\nGrad D: You should probably move the microphone closer to your face .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts\nGrad D: There 's like a little {disfmarker} The twisty thing , you can move it with .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and , s deliberately . So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . It 's just for closure . So that if we come up with a question of \" could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? \" or something . You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us we just need to really understand what 's there . Is there anything we can make use of ? Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ? But none of that has a short time fuse .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something . And then {disfmarker} So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement .\nGrad B: Oh OK .\nProfessor C: That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: but it means we can not think about it for six months .\nGrad B: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: So . The plan for this summer uh , really is to step back from the applied project ,\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor C: keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues .\nGrad B: Hmm . Oh OK .\nProfessor C: And , so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation . But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other {disfmarker} anything lik any other constraints for the time being .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK . Got it .\nProfessor C: It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then {disfmarker} and get the constructions in their form and stuff .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: And , I don I don't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints .\nGrad B: Right , OK .\nProfessor C: Um . And similarly with the parsing , uh we 're gonna worry about parsing uh , the general case you know , construction parser for general constructions . And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well .\nGrad B: So I mean , the {disfmarker} the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been {disfmarker} sort of been geared towards this demo ,\nProfessor C: Right . Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad B: and then that 's going to go away pretty soon .\nProfessor C: But {disfmarker} but we we 're swit\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: huh ?\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's got . What I {disfmarker} what I think is {disfmarker} is a good idea that I can {disfmarker} can show to anyone who 's interested , we can even make a {disfmarker} sort of an internal demo , and I {disfmarker} I show you what I do ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I speak into it and you hear it talk ,\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: and I can sort of walk f through the information . So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes . Just fun .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And so you {disfmarker} when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ? Just give a talk in the big room , and {disfmarker} and so peo people know what 's going on ? when you 're ready ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing {disfmarker} That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say \" this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it \" and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK . Well d we {disfmarker} we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: Indeed .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . Makes sense .\nProfessor C: But any so that {disfmarker} e e It 's clear , then , I think . Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where {disfmarker} Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . Now before we do that , let 's get back in {disfmarker} Oh ! But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can {disfmarker} can see what {disfmarker} what it is that {disfmarker} that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK , right .\nProfessor C: And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the {disfmarker} looked at the SmartKom stuff .\nGrad D: Wa uh {disfmarker} To some de uh what {disfmarker} what part of th the SmartKom stuff ?\nProfessor C: Well , the parser , and that stuff .\nGrad D: Oh yeah {disfmarker} yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . Anyway . So , the trip {disfmarker} the report on these {disfmarker} the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week .\nGrad B: Yeah . It 's alright .\nGrad E: Um . {vocalsound} Well it was just amazing to {disfmarker} to see uh how {disfmarker} how instable the whole thing is ,\nProfessor C: Maybe you 're done , then .\nGrad E: and if you just take the {disfmarker} And I g I got the feeling that we are {pause} the only ones right now who have a running system . I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version {disfmarker} that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . And so it 's {disfmarker} And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said \" yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version \" . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , the system {disfmarker} the integration group . And it was , uh {disfmarker} It was fun to some extent , but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman {disfmarker} um , I know that they enjoyed it here , and they r they {disfmarker} they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , what {disfmarker} what we have been thinking about , and they 're more than willing to {disfmarker} to um , cooperate , by all means . And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal \" group - ware \" server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and {disfmarker} and generating and constructions w we {disfmarker} we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . And um , the , uh {disfmarker} If I find someone at {disfmarker} in EML that is interested in that , um I {disfmarker} I may even think that we could look {disfmarker} take constructions and {disfmarker} and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that {disfmarker} that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline .\nProfessor C: Anyth - any other {vocalsound} {comment} uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? uh we {disfmarker} so we now know I think , what the landscape is like .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And so we just push on and {disfmarker} and uh , do what we need to do . And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight {disfmarker} tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So . Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions . OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? That is {disfmarker} {comment} So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . Yeah {comment} we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't . So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be uh , \" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do \" . And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks . So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh {disfmarker} hopefully a belief - net that does these things . And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual semantics . OK ? What all {disfmarker} you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate . So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out . Is {disfmarker} is that right ? I mean that 's {disfmarker} that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad G: So , I guess , um {disfmarker} Is there like a latest version of the belief - net {disfmarker} of the proposed belief - net ? Like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: We had um decided {disfmarker}\nGrad G: like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Well , no , we didn't decide . We wanted to look into maybe getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer , but I think if we do it , um , sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them , that should suffice .\nGrad G: Mm - hmm . Yeah , that should be fine .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem .\nGrad D: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: That 's separable , yeah .\nGrad D: I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag\nProfessor C: Yep . Right .\nGrad D: JavaBayes does not support that . I can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that . It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it ,\nProfessor C: Not {disfmarker} not at this point .\nGrad D: and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad D: and I couldn't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and , with this thing that we want .\nProfessor C: Well , we can p If it 's {disfmarker} If we can pay {disfmarker} Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that . OK ? So {disfmarker} so don't view free as {disfmarker} as a absolute constraint .\nGrad D: OK . OK , so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK . And you can ask Kevin .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , the one that uh people seem to use is uh Hugin or whatever ?\nProfessor C: Hugin , yeah that 's free .\nGrad G: How exp I don't think it 's {disfmarker} Is it free ? Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I {disfmarker} it seems to {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh , it may be free to academics . Like I {disfmarker} I don't know . I have a co {comment} I have a copy {comment} that I l I downloaded .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: So , at one point it was free .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um ,\nGrad D: How do you spell that ?\nProfessor C: HUGIN .\nGrad F: Why\nProfessor C: And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . So then , in any case , um {disfmarker} But paying a lit You know , if i if it 's uh {disfmarker} Probably for university , it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be real cheap anyway . But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it . I 'm mean , we have no need for that .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in changing the {disfmarker} the JavaBayes code .\nProfessor C: No ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: he 's not gonna do that .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that , it 's sort of a fish - eye . You {disfmarker} you have a node , and you click on it , and it shows you all the connections ,\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle . And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two . If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we {disfmarker} we need to solve right now . What I 'm {disfmarker} what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of {disfmarker} of the internal structure . Maybe node by node , or something like this ? Or should I collect it all\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Doesn't matter .\nGrad G: Um , just any like {disfmarker} like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best .\nGrad E: OK . And um you 're gonna be around ? t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? As usual ? Or will that change ?\nGrad G: Yeah {disfmarker} I mean , yeah , I can {disfmarker} like I c Um . This week I guess um , kind of {disfmarker} I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . So yes , I might {disfmarker} I can be around . And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: Yeah and this is not a crisis that {disfmarker} I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and then we 'll dig {disfmarker} d dig down on this .\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker} Yeah . OK . No , that 's good . That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it . So .\nGrad G: OK .\nGrad B: How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff . Right ? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Right . Well there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there There 're two different things you do .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: One is you design and the other is you learn . OK ? So uh what we 're gonna do initially is {disfmarker} is do design , and , i if you will , guess .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of {disfmarker} of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: If it 's done right , and if you have data then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although that takes a lot more data , and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . So uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it .\nGrad B: Alright .\nGrad E: Yeah . Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So but this is the {pause} {vocalsound} {comment} {pause} long run .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning .\nGrad B: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there I could swore {disfmarker} uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a {disfmarker} um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the {disfmarker} with the system ? Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to {disfmarker} to look at what {disfmarker} look at the stuff , and see what people are saying .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah make yourself a note . So and {disfmarker} and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , so whatever you guys can get .\nGrad E: The German . Oh yeah , of course , German . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , the y your native language , right ? You remember that one .\nGrad E: OK . That 's important , yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: So he 'll get you some data .\nGrad B: u OK . Yeah , I mean I {disfmarker} I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nGrad B: It was just {disfmarker} Strange , but .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad E: We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs .\nGrad B: Oh yeah , OK .\nGrad E: Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already .\nGrad B: OK , yeah , I mean .\nGrad E: So . {disfmarker} Transcribed . I will send you that . OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that we oughta talk about today ?\nGrad E: Ho - how was your thingy .\nGrad B: Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff ,\nProfessor C: Oh right .\nGrad B: and that was pretty interesting and you know , I mean , seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh {disfmarker} to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know , \" What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , \" or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . So , um , now that was {disfmarker} the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction {disfmarker} he 'd {disfmarker} what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , \" your bike is parked across the street \" and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , \" well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike \" , but um in {disfmarker} in Japanese the {disfmarker} the more conventionalized tendency is to use a {disfmarker} sort of a description of \" where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree \" . Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , \" there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river \" , or something like that . So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . But um {disfmarker} But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like \" right where you start to go up the hill \" , or \" just when you get off the train \" , or something like that to {disfmarker} uh , to indicate where something is .\nProfessor C: Mmm .\nGrad B: So we 'll have to think about {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: So {disfmarker} how much is that used in German ?\nGrad E: Um . The uh {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} I wa I was on a uh {disfmarker} on a {disfmarker} on a different sidetrack .\nProfessor C: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: I mean , the {disfmarker} the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at {disfmarker} at the moment , but this is a {disfmarker} a three language project : German , English , Japanese .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , we have a uh , uh {disfmarker} I have taken care that we have the {disfmarker} the Japanese generation and stuff . And so I looked into uh spatial description . So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . And {disfmarker} and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh {disfmarker} differences in spatial descriptions . Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , so how {disfmarker} how , I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So . Um .\nProfessor C: So , where is this huge project ?\nGrad E: It 's KLEIST . It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: \nProfessor C: Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: But um , I {disfmarker} I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for {disfmarker} for now ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: but um definitely it 's interesting to look at {disfmarker} at cross the bordered there .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Are {disfmarker} are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the direction relative {disfmarker} relative to the speaker ? For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English . We can say um \" park in front of the car \" as you come beh you drive behind the car . In Hebrew it means \" park behind the car \" , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Intrinsic , yeah .\nPhD A: While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So .\nGrad B: Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So , i i i is German uh closer to {disfmarker} to E uh , uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} to E I mean uh\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I don't think it {disfmarker} it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different .\nGrad E: Um , as a matter of fact {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: No , it 's not .\nGrad B: Right .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Um . Did you ever get to look at the {disfmarker} the rou paper that I sent you on the {disfmarker} on that problem in English and German ?\nGrad B: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Carroll , ninety - three . Um . I {disfmarker} There is a {disfmarker} a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad E: So it 's {disfmarker} they actually say \" the monkey in front of the car , where 's the monkey ? \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that {disfmarker} that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors .\nPhD A: That {disfmarker} but it wasn't {disfmarker} was {disfmarker}\nGrad E: That syntactic facto factors do {disfmarker} do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames .\nPhD A: Right . Mm - hmm . Right .\nGrad B: I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in {disfmarker} in English depending o\nProfessor C: Hmm .\nGrad B: You know , like , \" in front of the car \" could you know {disfmarker} Like , here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . I could see that ,\nProfessor C: Absolutely .\nGrad B: but {disfmarker} But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was {disfmarker} this was a {disfmarker} a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . So uh .\nGrad E: I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the {disfmarker} the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames .\nGrad B: Alright ! Cool !\nGrad E: So .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: Not really .\nProfessor C: Great . No , I 've not seen that .\nPhD A: What do you mean . Um . \" reference frames \" ?\nGrad E: It 's called a {disfmarker}\nPhD A: uh uh\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker} it 's spatial reference frames . You actually have only {disfmarker} Um . If you wanna have a {disfmarker} This is usually um {disfmarker} I should {disfmarker} there should be an \" L \" , though . Well actually you have {disfmarker} only have two choices . You can either do a two - point or a three - point which is you You 're familiar with th with the \" origo \" ? where that 's the center {disfmarker} \" Origo \" is the center of the f frame of reference .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: OK ? In some cases the origo is the same as the reference object .\nProfessor C: So that would be \" origin \" in English ,\nGrad F: This was like {disfmarker}\nGrad B: The origin .\nPhD A: Right\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: right ?\nGrad E: \" Origo \" is a Terminus technikus . in that sense , that 's even used in the English literature . \" Origo . \"\nGrad B: Oh , OK . I never heard it .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , so , this video tape is in front of me .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad E: Those are two - point .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , reference object and {disfmarker} Um . No , from {disfmarker} from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair .\nGrad B: Right . You {disfmarker} you can actually say things like , um , \" it 's behind the tree from me \" or something like that , I think , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in certain circumstances in English , right ? As sort of \" from where I 'm standing it would appear that \" {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . Yeah . So ,\nGrad F: Looks a little bit like Reichenbach for time .\nProfessor C: Yeah , it sounds like it , doesn't it ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a lot like it .\nGrad E: And then {disfmarker} and then here you {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Um .\nGrad E: On this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And that 's {comment} {disfmarker} that 's basically it . So . Egocentric two - point , egocentric three - point , or you can have allocentric .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: So , \" as seen from the church , the town hall is right of that um , fire station \" . aa - huh {comment} It 's hardly ever used but it 's w\nPhD A: I 'd love to see it if you {disfmarker} if you have a copy kind of . Uh .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . I see this is {disfmarker} this is getting into Ami 's thing .\nPhD A: Here\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: He 's {disfmarker} he 's very interested in that .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: So .\nGrad B: Me too .\nProfessor C: Uh . Yeah . Well , why don't you just put it on the web page ? There 's this EDU {disfmarker} Right ?\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or just {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor C: Or a link to it .\nGrad E: It 's also all on my {disfmarker} my home page at EML . It 's called \" An Anatomy of a Spatial Description \" .\nProfessor C: Just\nGrad E: But I 'll send that link .\nPhD A: OK , great .\nProfessor C: Maybe just put a link on . Yeah .\nGrad E: Yep .\nProfessor C: By the way , there {disfmarker} something that I didn't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .\nGrad E: Yep .\nGrad B: Huh .\nProfessor C: So there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know , near and far , or yon and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So this is all {disfmarker} This is {disfmarker} There 's this linguistic facts . But apparently , the {disfmarker} Uh . Here 's the way the findings go . That , you know they do MRI , and {disfmarker} and if you 're uh {disfmarker} got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up , and if something 's out of reach uh a different one . But here 's the {disfmarker} the amazing result , um , they say . You get someone with a {disfmarker} with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . So the s typical task is subdivision . So there 's a {disfmarker} a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , \" Where 's the midpoint ? \" And they do fine . If you give them the line , and they have to touch it , they can't . There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that . Here 's the real experiment . The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , \" where is it ? \" ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: they do it . Give them a stick , long stick , and say \" do it \" , they can't do it . So there 's a remapping of distant space into nearby space .\nPhD A: Right . So they doubled {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the end {disfmarker} the end of this {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Because it 's within reach now ?\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach uh , mechanism .\nGrad B: yeah .\nGrad F: Oh . Wow .\nGrad B: Circuits .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And so this doe This is , uh {disfmarker} First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about and I 'll do this {disfmarker} this test on you guys as well . So . Uh . How - I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , I start feeling the tip directly . Not indirectly , but you actually can feel the tip .\nGrad B: Yeah yeah .\nProfessor C: And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of , physical sensation , of the end affector .\nGrad B: Yeah . What 's going on at the end of the tool ,\nPhD A: The ext the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} The extension ,\nGrad B: yeah .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nGrad B: What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever .\nProfessor C: Yeah , within {disfmarker}\nPhD A: right .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nPhD A: The extension of {disfmarker} of your hand , right .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right . Have you hav y h had this ?\nPhD A: The {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think so . I mean i i it 's not exactly the th same thing , but {disfmarker} but s it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's getting close to that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad F: W what does it feel like ?\nProfessor C: Oh i it feels like your {disfmarker} as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth and {disfmarker} and you deal directly with it .\nPhD A: I once {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ? So you can insert your hand something\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nProfessor C: Right , yeah {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: and there 's a correspondence between {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So I played with it . After a while , you don't feel the difference anymore . I {disfmarker} I mean it 's kind of {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right .\nPhD A: Very {disfmarker} kind of {disfmarker} you stop back and suddenly it goes away and you have to kind of work again to recapture it , but yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Right , Yeah , so anyway , so {disfmarker} So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh , make this distinction . Of course there are behavioral differences too . Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference . And i this is , um {disfmarker} So . In addition to the e\nGrad E: This is more proximal - distal .\nProfessor C: Yeah uh exactly . So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded . S\nGrad E: Well , Dan Montello sort of , he {disfmarker} he does the uh uh {disfmarker} th the cognitive map world , down in Santa Barbara . And he {disfmarker} he always talks about these {disfmarker} He {disfmarker} he already {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} i probably most likely without knowing this {disfmarker} this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Well there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw . Anyway yeah , so we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll look at this . And . So , all of these issues now {disfmarker} are now starting to come up . So , now {disfmarker} we 're now done with demos . We 're starting to do science , right ? And so these issues about uh , reference , and {disfmarker} spatial {comment} reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh {comment} all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: um {disfmarker} So , all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now . So we gotta do all this . So there 's that . And then there 's also a set of system things that come up . So \" OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Right ?\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: It {disfmarker} it follows . And so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gonna build something and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is , and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the um , the grammar stuff .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology , so , um {disfmarker} And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on uh , \" is there an ontology API that {disfmarker} that \" {disfmarker} There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we build the parser and stuff around that , or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so {disfmarker} For example , is there something that we can use there . i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML have something that we can just p pull out , for that . Uh , so there are gonna be some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some things like that , which are not science but system . But we aren't gonna ignore those cuz we 're {disfmarker} we 're not only going {disfmarker} The plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . And how much we build , and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . So . It 's always been out of phase but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that . So we 've talked about it , and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing ,\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: It was just this uh construction analyzer . And so we think {disfmarker} we think we have a shot at {disfmarker} at that .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So . The for So . To {disfmarker} to come full circle on that , this formalization task , OK ? is trying to get the formalism into {disfmarker} into a shape where it can actually uh\nGrad B: Yeah . Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , right ?\nProfessor C: d Well , yeah , where it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} covers the whole range of things . And the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms . It turned out , inherently not to cover the space .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And it just {disfmarker} it was just terribly frustrating for him ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing .\nGrad B: I see . Right .\nProfessor C: And . Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .\nGrad B: OK . Good to know .\nProfessor C: Uh . Huh ? Is {disfmarker} This is true , is it not ?\nGrad D: Yes .\nProfessor C: OK . So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad F: You don't have a hidden purist streak ?\nGrad D: Oh no .\nProfessor C: We - well it hasn't it {disfmarker} it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case .\nGrad F: OK . Just checking .\nGrad D: No sir .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK . Uh . So . For {disfmarker} for {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Cuz I don't have to implement anything .\nProfessor C: Exactly right . Exactly .\nGrad F: I have a problem , then . It 's {disfmarker} So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad B: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: Right . Why {disfmarker} a actually , uh , the thing is , you {disfmarker} you do but , th the thing you have to im implement is so small that {disfmarker} Uh .\nGrad F: Which meeting I 'm in . It 's OK to be purist within that context .\nProfessor C: Within that , yeah ,\nGrad F: Yes ,\nProfessor C: and uh , it 's {disfmarker} a and still , I think , you know , get something done .\nGrad F: good .\nGrad B: Cool !\nProfessor C: But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if {disfmarker} if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , {vocalsound} is real hard .\nGrad F: Yay .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space ,\nPhD A: It 's possible yeah .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , uh , for his absentee thesis . I think you all know that {disfmarker} that you can just , in Germany {disfmarker} almost just send in your thesis .\nGrad B: Just a drive up . Ca - chuk !\nPhD A: Um\nProfessor C: Yeah right .\nGrad B: There you go .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad E: The - th There {disfmarker} there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh {vocalsound} joint over in Saarbruecken .\nGrad B: Exactly . Drive through , yeah .\nProfessor C: It costs a lot . The {disfmarker} the amount {disfmarker} You put in your credit card and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as well . But , uh , {disfmarker} But anyway , so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , so that {disfmarker} that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into . And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So , de Uh . And her name is Eva .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: It really is . Nobody believed th th that {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah , I thought it had to be a joke , of your part , you know\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad F: like {disfmarker} {comment} \" Johno made it up , I 'm sure . \"\nGrad G: Is this person someone who 's in first - year this year ,\nProfessor C: No , first year coming .\nGrad G: or\nProfessor C: So , she 's {disfmarker} she 's now out here she 's moved , and she 'll be a student as of then .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh .\nGrad E: Document .\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor C: Uh , against all traditions . And actually I talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . Uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Someone from the class ?\nProfessor C: No , interestingly enough .\nGrad F: We always get these people who are not in the class , who {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Some of th some of them , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's interesting .\nProfessor C: So anyway , uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Uh , so , um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read . So we 'll see how this goes . Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first {disfmarker} {comment} incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , so we 'll see how that goes . Um , anyway , so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , I 'm not sure . It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes . S so , we 'll see . And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape ,\nPhD A: OK .\nProfessor C: so uh and ,\nPhD A: Right\nProfessor C: I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the {disfmarker} your traditional questions in this light , uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be quite happy to uh see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and um , how they might uh get reflected in constructions .\nGrad B: Sure .\nProfessor C: I suspect that 's right .\nGrad B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I may have to go to Switzerland for {disfmarker} in June or beginning of July for between two weeks and four weeks , but uh , after that or before that .\nProfessor C: OK , fine . And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in {disfmarker} in the neighborhood .\nPhD A: Right . Yeah be uh actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yep . E o do y\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , we we 're connected to uh {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a very significant connection between {disfmarker} We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go through this ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh {disfmarker} It 's the {disfmarker} Fr Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes . There 's one in {disfmarker} in Zurich ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: E T and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne ,\nGrad B: Oh , so in Switzerland .\nProfessor C: OK ? which is uh E P\nPhD A: Great .\nProfessor C: F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: Probably we 're connected to them .\nPhD A: Great . I 'll let you know . S I 'll send you email .\nProfessor C: OK . Yeah , and so anyway we c uh {disfmarker} We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Hmm . Uh . I {disfmarker} I think the one you {disfmarker} you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .\nPhD A: Sure , yeah .\nProfessor C: A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so , and {disfmarker} and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .\nPhD A: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor C: And you 'll get feedback from these guys .\nPhD A: Great , yeah .\nProfessor C: Cuz they 've actually {disfmarker} these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . So we 'll set that up .\nPhD A: Cool .\nProfessor C: OK . So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the {disfmarker} uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I tho It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .\nProfessor C: OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying \" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand \" . And that we as a group will try to {disfmarker} to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .\nGrad G: Sure .\nProfessor C: OK ? Uh , \" these are the decisions \" {disfmarker} I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: You know . We {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Does that so make sense ?\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , the {disfmarker} the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ?\nGrad G: No , I {disfmarker} I think I 'll be done {disfmarker} everything by this uh {disfmarker} by the end of this week .\nGrad E: Same with you ? No .\nGrad D: Nnn . This {disfmarker} Well , I 've {disfmarker} I have projects , but then the {disfmarker} my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess .\nGrad G: Hmm .\nProfessor C: Right . Um , But anyway , yeah .\nGrad B: Pretty soon .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so I guess that 's\nGrad D: So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .\nProfessor C: Right . right . So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking , uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: right ? So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So we 'll do that . Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa\nGrad B: Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah .\nProfessor C: We {disfmarker} we want those ,\nGrad B: Yeah , oh yeah .\nProfessor C: right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So let me {disfmarker} let me make a note to do that .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer ,\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Oh right ! Right right right !\nGrad B: so .\nProfessor C: That 's great ! Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: Hi\nGrad B: Right , no faculty !\nProfessor C: Th - the faculty aren't {disfmarker} faculty aren't supposed to know .\nGrad D: Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .\nProfessor C: But um , I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah , right . It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all ,\nGrad D: Bhaskara .\nGrad B: right .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What demos would the system be involved in?\nAnswer:", "input": "What demos would the system be involved in?", "context": "Grad B: \nGrad D: How many batteries do you go through ?\nGrad B: Thank you .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: Sure .\nProfessor C: Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done .\nGrad E: Yeah , I think so too . Um . The {disfmarker} we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . \" It actually says , \" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So uh ,\nProfessor C: It doesn't know \" I \" .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: Um , the uh\nGrad B: Oh , Am Spartacus . \"\nGrad D: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it 's saying .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad B: Verstehe . OK .\nGrad D: I gue\nGrad E: The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this {disfmarker} uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some {disfmarker} some sentences . No , right ?\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , for a couple {disfmarker}\nGrad D: So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a {disfmarker} er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like {disfmarker} the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a {disfmarker} basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so it just starts {disfmarker} uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .\nGrad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the {disfmarker} the syntax trees for three or four .\nGrad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the {disfmarker} from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , \" noun goes to \" , you know , Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .\nGrad B: OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright .\nGrad E: And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we {disfmarker} we worked around that . The , uh {disfmarker} the system , um {disfmarker} I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was {disfmarker} It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .\nGrad D: Why {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in {disfmarker} in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,\nGrad E: You have to switch it on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \" , when I build the {disfmarker} built the tree .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: Like .\nProfessor C: So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: um\nGrad B: I {disfmarker} I still don't {disfmarker} I still don't really understand e like {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Well Tilman s\nGrad B: I mean we sort of say , um {disfmarker} You know , I {disfmarker} I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in {disfmarker} in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user , and then magically it sort of s\nProfessor C: Yeah {disfmarker}\nGrad B: I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ?\nProfessor C: I thi Yeah . So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group ,\nGrad B: R uh Sure .\nProfessor C: but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it .\nGrad B: Yeah , soon . OK .\nProfessor C: And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together .\nGrad B: That 's fine .\nProfessor C: It 's eee {comment} messy but once you understand it you understand it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} There 's nothing really complicated about it .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: No .\nGrad B: And I remember one thing that {disfmarker} that came up in the talk last Wednesday . Um , was this , I {disfmarker} I think he talked about the idea of like , um {disfmarker} He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of {disfmarker} for each word you , um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK , you know how to do it ?\nGrad B: For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . That 's , you know , that 's {disfmarker} that 's HPSG or whatever .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Now , we 're {disfmarker} we 're not committed for our research to {pause} do any of those things .\nGrad B: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So uh we are committed for our funding .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: OK ? to {pause} uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Make our stuff fit to that .\nProfessor C: Yeah , to {disfmarker} n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need .\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: OK ? So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great .\nGrad D: You should probably move the microphone closer to your face .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts\nGrad D: There 's like a little {disfmarker} The twisty thing , you can move it with .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and , s deliberately . So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . It 's just for closure . So that if we come up with a question of \" could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? \" or something . You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us we just need to really understand what 's there . Is there anything we can make use of ? Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ? But none of that has a short time fuse .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something . And then {disfmarker} So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement .\nGrad B: Oh OK .\nProfessor C: That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: but it means we can not think about it for six months .\nGrad B: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: So . The plan for this summer uh , really is to step back from the applied project ,\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor C: keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues .\nGrad B: Hmm . Oh OK .\nProfessor C: And , so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation . But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other {disfmarker} anything lik any other constraints for the time being .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK . Got it .\nProfessor C: It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then {disfmarker} and get the constructions in their form and stuff .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: And , I don I don't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints .\nGrad B: Right , OK .\nProfessor C: Um . And similarly with the parsing , uh we 're gonna worry about parsing uh , the general case you know , construction parser for general constructions . And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well .\nGrad B: So I mean , the {disfmarker} the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been {disfmarker} sort of been geared towards this demo ,\nProfessor C: Right . Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad B: and then that 's going to go away pretty soon .\nProfessor C: But {disfmarker} but we we 're swit\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: huh ?\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's got . What I {disfmarker} what I think is {disfmarker} is a good idea that I can {disfmarker} can show to anyone who 's interested , we can even make a {disfmarker} sort of an internal demo , and I {disfmarker} I show you what I do ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I speak into it and you hear it talk ,\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: and I can sort of walk f through the information . So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes . Just fun .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And so you {disfmarker} when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ? Just give a talk in the big room , and {disfmarker} and so peo people know what 's going on ? when you 're ready ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing {disfmarker} That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say \" this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it \" and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK . Well d we {disfmarker} we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: Indeed .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . Makes sense .\nProfessor C: But any so that {disfmarker} e e It 's clear , then , I think . Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where {disfmarker} Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . Now before we do that , let 's get back in {disfmarker} Oh ! But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can {disfmarker} can see what {disfmarker} what it is that {disfmarker} that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK , right .\nProfessor C: And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the {disfmarker} looked at the SmartKom stuff .\nGrad D: Wa uh {disfmarker} To some de uh what {disfmarker} what part of th the SmartKom stuff ?\nProfessor C: Well , the parser , and that stuff .\nGrad D: Oh yeah {disfmarker} yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . Anyway . So , the trip {disfmarker} the report on these {disfmarker} the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week .\nGrad B: Yeah . It 's alright .\nGrad E: Um . {vocalsound} Well it was just amazing to {disfmarker} to see uh how {disfmarker} how instable the whole thing is ,\nProfessor C: Maybe you 're done , then .\nGrad E: and if you just take the {disfmarker} And I g I got the feeling that we are {pause} the only ones right now who have a running system . I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version {disfmarker} that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . And so it 's {disfmarker} And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said \" yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version \" . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , the system {disfmarker} the integration group . And it was , uh {disfmarker} It was fun to some extent , but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman {disfmarker} um , I know that they enjoyed it here , and they r they {disfmarker} they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , what {disfmarker} what we have been thinking about , and they 're more than willing to {disfmarker} to um , cooperate , by all means . And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal \" group - ware \" server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and {disfmarker} and generating and constructions w we {disfmarker} we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . And um , the , uh {disfmarker} If I find someone at {disfmarker} in EML that is interested in that , um I {disfmarker} I may even think that we could look {disfmarker} take constructions and {disfmarker} and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that {disfmarker} that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline .\nProfessor C: Anyth - any other {vocalsound} {comment} uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? uh we {disfmarker} so we now know I think , what the landscape is like .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And so we just push on and {disfmarker} and uh , do what we need to do . And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight {disfmarker} tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So . Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions . OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? That is {disfmarker} {comment} So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . Yeah {comment} we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't . So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be uh , \" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do \" . And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks . So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh {disfmarker} hopefully a belief - net that does these things . And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual semantics . OK ? What all {disfmarker} you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate . So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out . Is {disfmarker} is that right ? I mean that 's {disfmarker} that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad G: So , I guess , um {disfmarker} Is there like a latest version of the belief - net {disfmarker} of the proposed belief - net ? Like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: We had um decided {disfmarker}\nGrad G: like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Well , no , we didn't decide . We wanted to look into maybe getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer , but I think if we do it , um , sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them , that should suffice .\nGrad G: Mm - hmm . Yeah , that should be fine .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem .\nGrad D: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: That 's separable , yeah .\nGrad D: I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag\nProfessor C: Yep . Right .\nGrad D: JavaBayes does not support that . I can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that . It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it ,\nProfessor C: Not {disfmarker} not at this point .\nGrad D: and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad D: and I couldn't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and , with this thing that we want .\nProfessor C: Well , we can p If it 's {disfmarker} If we can pay {disfmarker} Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that . OK ? So {disfmarker} so don't view free as {disfmarker} as a absolute constraint .\nGrad D: OK . OK , so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK . And you can ask Kevin .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , the one that uh people seem to use is uh Hugin or whatever ?\nProfessor C: Hugin , yeah that 's free .\nGrad G: How exp I don't think it 's {disfmarker} Is it free ? Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I {disfmarker} it seems to {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh , it may be free to academics . Like I {disfmarker} I don't know . I have a co {comment} I have a copy {comment} that I l I downloaded .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: So , at one point it was free .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um ,\nGrad D: How do you spell that ?\nProfessor C: HUGIN .\nGrad F: Why\nProfessor C: And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . So then , in any case , um {disfmarker} But paying a lit You know , if i if it 's uh {disfmarker} Probably for university , it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be real cheap anyway . But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it . I 'm mean , we have no need for that .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in changing the {disfmarker} the JavaBayes code .\nProfessor C: No ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: he 's not gonna do that .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that , it 's sort of a fish - eye . You {disfmarker} you have a node , and you click on it , and it shows you all the connections ,\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle . And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two . If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we {disfmarker} we need to solve right now . What I 'm {disfmarker} what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of {disfmarker} of the internal structure . Maybe node by node , or something like this ? Or should I collect it all\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Doesn't matter .\nGrad G: Um , just any like {disfmarker} like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best .\nGrad E: OK . And um you 're gonna be around ? t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? As usual ? Or will that change ?\nGrad G: Yeah {disfmarker} I mean , yeah , I can {disfmarker} like I c Um . This week I guess um , kind of {disfmarker} I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . So yes , I might {disfmarker} I can be around . And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: Yeah and this is not a crisis that {disfmarker} I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and then we 'll dig {disfmarker} d dig down on this .\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker} Yeah . OK . No , that 's good . That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it . So .\nGrad G: OK .\nGrad B: How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff . Right ? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Right . Well there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there There 're two different things you do .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: One is you design and the other is you learn . OK ? So uh what we 're gonna do initially is {disfmarker} is do design , and , i if you will , guess .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of {disfmarker} of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: If it 's done right , and if you have data then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although that takes a lot more data , and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . So uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it .\nGrad B: Alright .\nGrad E: Yeah . Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So but this is the {pause} {vocalsound} {comment} {pause} long run .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning .\nGrad B: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there I could swore {disfmarker} uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a {disfmarker} um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the {disfmarker} with the system ? Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to {disfmarker} to look at what {disfmarker} look at the stuff , and see what people are saying .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah make yourself a note . So and {disfmarker} and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , so whatever you guys can get .\nGrad E: The German . Oh yeah , of course , German . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , the y your native language , right ? You remember that one .\nGrad E: OK . That 's important , yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: So he 'll get you some data .\nGrad B: u OK . Yeah , I mean I {disfmarker} I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nGrad B: It was just {disfmarker} Strange , but .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad E: We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs .\nGrad B: Oh yeah , OK .\nGrad E: Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already .\nGrad B: OK , yeah , I mean .\nGrad E: So . {disfmarker} Transcribed . I will send you that . OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that we oughta talk about today ?\nGrad E: Ho - how was your thingy .\nGrad B: Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff ,\nProfessor C: Oh right .\nGrad B: and that was pretty interesting and you know , I mean , seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh {disfmarker} to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know , \" What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , \" or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . So , um , now that was {disfmarker} the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction {disfmarker} he 'd {disfmarker} what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , \" your bike is parked across the street \" and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , \" well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike \" , but um in {disfmarker} in Japanese the {disfmarker} the more conventionalized tendency is to use a {disfmarker} sort of a description of \" where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree \" . Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , \" there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river \" , or something like that . So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . But um {disfmarker} But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like \" right where you start to go up the hill \" , or \" just when you get off the train \" , or something like that to {disfmarker} uh , to indicate where something is .\nProfessor C: Mmm .\nGrad B: So we 'll have to think about {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: So {disfmarker} how much is that used in German ?\nGrad E: Um . The uh {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} I wa I was on a uh {disfmarker} on a {disfmarker} on a different sidetrack .\nProfessor C: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: I mean , the {disfmarker} the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at {disfmarker} at the moment , but this is a {disfmarker} a three language project : German , English , Japanese .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , we have a uh , uh {disfmarker} I have taken care that we have the {disfmarker} the Japanese generation and stuff . And so I looked into uh spatial description . So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . And {disfmarker} and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh {disfmarker} differences in spatial descriptions . Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , so how {disfmarker} how , I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So . Um .\nProfessor C: So , where is this huge project ?\nGrad E: It 's KLEIST . It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: \nProfessor C: Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: But um , I {disfmarker} I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for {disfmarker} for now ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: but um definitely it 's interesting to look at {disfmarker} at cross the bordered there .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Are {disfmarker} are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the direction relative {disfmarker} relative to the speaker ? For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English . We can say um \" park in front of the car \" as you come beh you drive behind the car . In Hebrew it means \" park behind the car \" , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Intrinsic , yeah .\nPhD A: While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So .\nGrad B: Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So , i i i is German uh closer to {disfmarker} to E uh , uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} to E I mean uh\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I don't think it {disfmarker} it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different .\nGrad E: Um , as a matter of fact {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: No , it 's not .\nGrad B: Right .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Um . Did you ever get to look at the {disfmarker} the rou paper that I sent you on the {disfmarker} on that problem in English and German ?\nGrad B: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Carroll , ninety - three . Um . I {disfmarker} There is a {disfmarker} a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad E: So it 's {disfmarker} they actually say \" the monkey in front of the car , where 's the monkey ? \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that {disfmarker} that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors .\nPhD A: That {disfmarker} but it wasn't {disfmarker} was {disfmarker}\nGrad E: That syntactic facto factors do {disfmarker} do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames .\nPhD A: Right . Mm - hmm . Right .\nGrad B: I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in {disfmarker} in English depending o\nProfessor C: Hmm .\nGrad B: You know , like , \" in front of the car \" could you know {disfmarker} Like , here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . I could see that ,\nProfessor C: Absolutely .\nGrad B: but {disfmarker} But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was {disfmarker} this was a {disfmarker} a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . So uh .\nGrad E: I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the {disfmarker} the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames .\nGrad B: Alright ! Cool !\nGrad E: So .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: Not really .\nProfessor C: Great . No , I 've not seen that .\nPhD A: What do you mean . Um . \" reference frames \" ?\nGrad E: It 's called a {disfmarker}\nPhD A: uh uh\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker} it 's spatial reference frames . You actually have only {disfmarker} Um . If you wanna have a {disfmarker} This is usually um {disfmarker} I should {disfmarker} there should be an \" L \" , though . Well actually you have {disfmarker} only have two choices . You can either do a two - point or a three - point which is you You 're familiar with th with the \" origo \" ? where that 's the center {disfmarker} \" Origo \" is the center of the f frame of reference .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: OK ? In some cases the origo is the same as the reference object .\nProfessor C: So that would be \" origin \" in English ,\nGrad F: This was like {disfmarker}\nGrad B: The origin .\nPhD A: Right\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: right ?\nGrad E: \" Origo \" is a Terminus technikus . in that sense , that 's even used in the English literature . \" Origo . \"\nGrad B: Oh , OK . I never heard it .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , so , this video tape is in front of me .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad E: Those are two - point .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , reference object and {disfmarker} Um . No , from {disfmarker} from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair .\nGrad B: Right . You {disfmarker} you can actually say things like , um , \" it 's behind the tree from me \" or something like that , I think , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in certain circumstances in English , right ? As sort of \" from where I 'm standing it would appear that \" {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . Yeah . So ,\nGrad F: Looks a little bit like Reichenbach for time .\nProfessor C: Yeah , it sounds like it , doesn't it ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a lot like it .\nGrad E: And then {disfmarker} and then here you {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Um .\nGrad E: On this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And that 's {comment} {disfmarker} that 's basically it . So . Egocentric two - point , egocentric three - point , or you can have allocentric .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: So , \" as seen from the church , the town hall is right of that um , fire station \" . aa - huh {comment} It 's hardly ever used but it 's w\nPhD A: I 'd love to see it if you {disfmarker} if you have a copy kind of . Uh .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . I see this is {disfmarker} this is getting into Ami 's thing .\nPhD A: Here\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: He 's {disfmarker} he 's very interested in that .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: So .\nGrad B: Me too .\nProfessor C: Uh . Yeah . Well , why don't you just put it on the web page ? There 's this EDU {disfmarker} Right ?\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or just {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor C: Or a link to it .\nGrad E: It 's also all on my {disfmarker} my home page at EML . It 's called \" An Anatomy of a Spatial Description \" .\nProfessor C: Just\nGrad E: But I 'll send that link .\nPhD A: OK , great .\nProfessor C: Maybe just put a link on . Yeah .\nGrad E: Yep .\nProfessor C: By the way , there {disfmarker} something that I didn't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .\nGrad E: Yep .\nGrad B: Huh .\nProfessor C: So there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know , near and far , or yon and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So this is all {disfmarker} This is {disfmarker} There 's this linguistic facts . But apparently , the {disfmarker} Uh . Here 's the way the findings go . That , you know they do MRI , and {disfmarker} and if you 're uh {disfmarker} got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up , and if something 's out of reach uh a different one . But here 's the {disfmarker} the amazing result , um , they say . You get someone with a {disfmarker} with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . So the s typical task is subdivision . So there 's a {disfmarker} a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , \" Where 's the midpoint ? \" And they do fine . If you give them the line , and they have to touch it , they can't . There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that . Here 's the real experiment . The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , \" where is it ? \" ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: they do it . Give them a stick , long stick , and say \" do it \" , they can't do it . So there 's a remapping of distant space into nearby space .\nPhD A: Right . So they doubled {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the end {disfmarker} the end of this {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Because it 's within reach now ?\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach uh , mechanism .\nGrad B: yeah .\nGrad F: Oh . Wow .\nGrad B: Circuits .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And so this doe This is , uh {disfmarker} First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about and I 'll do this {disfmarker} this test on you guys as well . So . Uh . How - I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , I start feeling the tip directly . Not indirectly , but you actually can feel the tip .\nGrad B: Yeah yeah .\nProfessor C: And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of , physical sensation , of the end affector .\nGrad B: Yeah . What 's going on at the end of the tool ,\nPhD A: The ext the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} The extension ,\nGrad B: yeah .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nGrad B: What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever .\nProfessor C: Yeah , within {disfmarker}\nPhD A: right .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nPhD A: The extension of {disfmarker} of your hand , right .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right . Have you hav y h had this ?\nPhD A: The {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think so . I mean i i it 's not exactly the th same thing , but {disfmarker} but s it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's getting close to that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad F: W what does it feel like ?\nProfessor C: Oh i it feels like your {disfmarker} as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth and {disfmarker} and you deal directly with it .\nPhD A: I once {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ? So you can insert your hand something\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nProfessor C: Right , yeah {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: and there 's a correspondence between {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So I played with it . After a while , you don't feel the difference anymore . I {disfmarker} I mean it 's kind of {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right .\nPhD A: Very {disfmarker} kind of {disfmarker} you stop back and suddenly it goes away and you have to kind of work again to recapture it , but yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Right , Yeah , so anyway , so {disfmarker} So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh , make this distinction . Of course there are behavioral differences too . Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference . And i this is , um {disfmarker} So . In addition to the e\nGrad E: This is more proximal - distal .\nProfessor C: Yeah uh exactly . So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded . S\nGrad E: Well , Dan Montello sort of , he {disfmarker} he does the uh uh {disfmarker} th the cognitive map world , down in Santa Barbara . And he {disfmarker} he always talks about these {disfmarker} He {disfmarker} he already {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} i probably most likely without knowing this {disfmarker} this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Well there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw . Anyway yeah , so we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll look at this . And . So , all of these issues now {disfmarker} are now starting to come up . So , now {disfmarker} we 're now done with demos . We 're starting to do science , right ? And so these issues about uh , reference , and {disfmarker} spatial {comment} reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh {comment} all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: um {disfmarker} So , all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now . So we gotta do all this . So there 's that . And then there 's also a set of system things that come up . So \" OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Right ?\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: It {disfmarker} it follows . And so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gonna build something and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is , and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the um , the grammar stuff .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology , so , um {disfmarker} And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on uh , \" is there an ontology API that {disfmarker} that \" {disfmarker} There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we build the parser and stuff around that , or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so {disfmarker} For example , is there something that we can use there . i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML have something that we can just p pull out , for that . Uh , so there are gonna be some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some things like that , which are not science but system . But we aren't gonna ignore those cuz we 're {disfmarker} we 're not only going {disfmarker} The plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . And how much we build , and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . So . It 's always been out of phase but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that . So we 've talked about it , and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing ,\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: It was just this uh construction analyzer . And so we think {disfmarker} we think we have a shot at {disfmarker} at that .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So . The for So . To {disfmarker} to come full circle on that , this formalization task , OK ? is trying to get the formalism into {disfmarker} into a shape where it can actually uh\nGrad B: Yeah . Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , right ?\nProfessor C: d Well , yeah , where it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} covers the whole range of things . And the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms . It turned out , inherently not to cover the space .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And it just {disfmarker} it was just terribly frustrating for him ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing .\nGrad B: I see . Right .\nProfessor C: And . Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .\nGrad B: OK . Good to know .\nProfessor C: Uh . Huh ? Is {disfmarker} This is true , is it not ?\nGrad D: Yes .\nProfessor C: OK . So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad F: You don't have a hidden purist streak ?\nGrad D: Oh no .\nProfessor C: We - well it hasn't it {disfmarker} it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case .\nGrad F: OK . Just checking .\nGrad D: No sir .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK . Uh . So . For {disfmarker} for {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Cuz I don't have to implement anything .\nProfessor C: Exactly right . Exactly .\nGrad F: I have a problem , then . It 's {disfmarker} So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad B: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: Right . Why {disfmarker} a actually , uh , the thing is , you {disfmarker} you do but , th the thing you have to im implement is so small that {disfmarker} Uh .\nGrad F: Which meeting I 'm in . It 's OK to be purist within that context .\nProfessor C: Within that , yeah ,\nGrad F: Yes ,\nProfessor C: and uh , it 's {disfmarker} a and still , I think , you know , get something done .\nGrad F: good .\nGrad B: Cool !\nProfessor C: But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if {disfmarker} if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , {vocalsound} is real hard .\nGrad F: Yay .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space ,\nPhD A: It 's possible yeah .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , uh , for his absentee thesis . I think you all know that {disfmarker} that you can just , in Germany {disfmarker} almost just send in your thesis .\nGrad B: Just a drive up . Ca - chuk !\nPhD A: Um\nProfessor C: Yeah right .\nGrad B: There you go .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad E: The - th There {disfmarker} there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh {vocalsound} joint over in Saarbruecken .\nGrad B: Exactly . Drive through , yeah .\nProfessor C: It costs a lot . The {disfmarker} the amount {disfmarker} You put in your credit card and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as well . But , uh , {disfmarker} But anyway , so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , so that {disfmarker} that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into . And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So , de Uh . And her name is Eva .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: It really is . Nobody believed th th that {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah , I thought it had to be a joke , of your part , you know\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad F: like {disfmarker} {comment} \" Johno made it up , I 'm sure . \"\nGrad G: Is this person someone who 's in first - year this year ,\nProfessor C: No , first year coming .\nGrad G: or\nProfessor C: So , she 's {disfmarker} she 's now out here she 's moved , and she 'll be a student as of then .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh .\nGrad E: Document .\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor C: Uh , against all traditions . And actually I talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . Uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Someone from the class ?\nProfessor C: No , interestingly enough .\nGrad F: We always get these people who are not in the class , who {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Some of th some of them , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's interesting .\nProfessor C: So anyway , uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Uh , so , um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read . So we 'll see how this goes . Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first {disfmarker} {comment} incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , so we 'll see how that goes . Um , anyway , so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , I 'm not sure . It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes . S so , we 'll see . And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape ,\nPhD A: OK .\nProfessor C: so uh and ,\nPhD A: Right\nProfessor C: I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the {disfmarker} your traditional questions in this light , uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be quite happy to uh see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and um , how they might uh get reflected in constructions .\nGrad B: Sure .\nProfessor C: I suspect that 's right .\nGrad B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I may have to go to Switzerland for {disfmarker} in June or beginning of July for between two weeks and four weeks , but uh , after that or before that .\nProfessor C: OK , fine . And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in {disfmarker} in the neighborhood .\nPhD A: Right . Yeah be uh actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yep . E o do y\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , we we 're connected to uh {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a very significant connection between {disfmarker} We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go through this ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh {disfmarker} It 's the {disfmarker} Fr Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes . There 's one in {disfmarker} in Zurich ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: E T and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne ,\nGrad B: Oh , so in Switzerland .\nProfessor C: OK ? which is uh E P\nPhD A: Great .\nProfessor C: F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: Probably we 're connected to them .\nPhD A: Great . I 'll let you know . S I 'll send you email .\nProfessor C: OK . Yeah , and so anyway we c uh {disfmarker} We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Hmm . Uh . I {disfmarker} I think the one you {disfmarker} you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .\nPhD A: Sure , yeah .\nProfessor C: A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so , and {disfmarker} and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .\nPhD A: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor C: And you 'll get feedback from these guys .\nPhD A: Great , yeah .\nProfessor C: Cuz they 've actually {disfmarker} these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . So we 'll set that up .\nPhD A: Cool .\nProfessor C: OK . So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the {disfmarker} uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I tho It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .\nProfessor C: OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying \" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand \" . And that we as a group will try to {disfmarker} to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .\nGrad G: Sure .\nProfessor C: OK ? Uh , \" these are the decisions \" {disfmarker} I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: You know . We {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Does that so make sense ?\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , the {disfmarker} the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ?\nGrad G: No , I {disfmarker} I think I 'll be done {disfmarker} everything by this uh {disfmarker} by the end of this week .\nGrad E: Same with you ? No .\nGrad D: Nnn . This {disfmarker} Well , I 've {disfmarker} I have projects , but then the {disfmarker} my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess .\nGrad G: Hmm .\nProfessor C: Right . Um , But anyway , yeah .\nGrad B: Pretty soon .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so I guess that 's\nGrad D: So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .\nProfessor C: Right . right . So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking , uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: right ? So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So we 'll do that . Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa\nGrad B: Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah .\nProfessor C: We {disfmarker} we want those ,\nGrad B: Yeah , oh yeah .\nProfessor C: right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So let me {disfmarker} let me make a note to do that .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer ,\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Oh right ! Right right right !\nGrad B: so .\nProfessor C: That 's great ! Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: Hi\nGrad B: Right , no faculty !\nProfessor C: Th - the faculty aren't {disfmarker} faculty aren't supposed to know .\nGrad D: Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .\nProfessor C: But um , I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah , right . It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all ,\nGrad D: Bhaskara .\nGrad B: right .", "answers": ["The final english SmartKom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised."], "pred": " The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery: What query based on the query.\nAnswer: The query based on the query.\nQuery", "length": 12646, "dataset": "qmsum", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "23625b932c93b52caf7504ee1a134d53a4096dc59744d759"}

Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't care . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh this , you mean ?\nProject Manager: Yes . The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: the sides .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah .

Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up .

That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , six .\nMarketing: So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , true or false .\nMarketing: And you {gap} true or false .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .\nMarketing: And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry .\nProject Manager: You ?\nUser Interface: Three .\nProject Manager: Me too . So it's a three .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .\nUser Interface: Mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .\nProject Manager: So it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's uh a six .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nUser Interface: Mm , four .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think it's four .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: but\nProject Manager: Yes . So , I think it's four .\nUser Interface: older {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .\nProject Manager: Okay . Give it a four .\nIndustrial Designer: Four .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Four . Uh , okay . Mm .\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics .\nMarketing: That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .\nIndustrial Designer: Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . Two .\nProject Manager: Uh , I say uh a five .\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't .\nIndustrial Designer: It {disfmarker} it will be fashion .\nProject Manager: Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Then make it th three .\nMarketing: Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too .\nProject Manager: No . Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Three is okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , agree ?\nProject Manager: I use my feet though . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A three .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .\nIndustrial Designer: I give it a one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} . Yes , a one . I like it .\nProject Manager: Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We have to do our uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Say two .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nProject Manager: Okay , two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Two . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You ?\nUser Interface: One . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Me too . One .\nMarketing: One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next , six . It does not get lost easily .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Just a small thing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah . Yellow .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Looks like a pistol .\nProject Manager: Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .\nProject Manager: No . It won't get lost .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It won't .\nProject Manager: A one ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , o one .\nProject Manager: Okay , a one .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: Next .\nMarketing: Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .\nProject Manager: Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Me too .\nProject Manager: That was our target . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel .\nMarketing: Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T\nIndustrial Designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yes , a one .\nProject Manager: I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I think s two is better .\nUser Interface: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Two is okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .\nProject Manager: No , it's new . Innovation .\nMarketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm , three .\nProject Manager: Me too . Three .\nMarketing: A three .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .\nProject Manager: Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} .\nMarketing: So , we will do that . Yes .\nProject Manager: Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .\nMarketing: By nine .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Come on . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , nah . Okay .\nMarketing: So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's good .\nMarketing: So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think {gap} .\nMarketing: Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: And I closed your slide-show .\nProject Manager: Back to my uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .\nProject Manager: Yep . Next please .\nMarketing: Next . Finance .\nProject Manager: So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cheapest there is .\nProject Manager: Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .\nIndustrial Designer: Expensive .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it's the most advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the simple , regular and advanced .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} we have half rubber , half plastic .\nUser Interface: Mm , yes .\nProject Manager: No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yellow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: And it's not really a s\nIndustrial Designer: Joystick uh thing .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , no . It's too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh\nProject Manager: So , we have to change something .\nIndustrial Designer: What what are the costs ?\nProject Manager: Fifteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Fifteen .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour .\nMarketing: {gap} . We would have uh n\nIndustrial Designer: A special colour .\nProject Manager: Oh , no , we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .\nProject Manager: No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?\nMarketing: For a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} What ?\nMarketing: I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .\nProject Manager: Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ?\nProject Manager: That's one Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: One Euro discount . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .\nProject Manager: Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh .\nProject Manager: Then it's not good anymore .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yellow rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: No one will see it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , normal .\nIndustrial Designer: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And it's twelve Euros , I think .\nProject Manager: One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No . Uh , no , no , no .\nProject Manager: Or it's then a regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay then .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: How did User Interface introduce the prototype of the remote control?\nAnswer:", "input": "How did User Interface introduce the prototype of the remote control?", "context": "Project Manager: Okay . So , now um , {vocalsound} last time . Can you uh {vocalsound} push the button ? {vocalsound} One time please . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't care . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh this , you mean ?\nProject Manager: Yes . The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh ?\nUser Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: the sides .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer: The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , six .\nMarketing: So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , true or false .\nMarketing: And you {gap} true or false .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .\nMarketing: And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry .\nProject Manager: You ?\nUser Interface: Three .\nProject Manager: Me too . So it's a three .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .\nUser Interface: Mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .\nProject Manager: So it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's uh a six .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nUser Interface: Mm , four .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think it's four .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: but\nProject Manager: Yes . So , I think it's four .\nUser Interface: older {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .\nProject Manager: Okay . Give it a four .\nIndustrial Designer: Four .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Four . Uh , okay . Mm .\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics .\nMarketing: That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .\nIndustrial Designer: Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . Two .\nProject Manager: Uh , I say uh a five .\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't .\nIndustrial Designer: It {disfmarker} it will be fashion .\nProject Manager: Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Then make it th three .\nMarketing: Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too .\nProject Manager: No . Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Three is okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , agree ?\nProject Manager: I use my feet though . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A three .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .\nIndustrial Designer: I give it a one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} . Yes , a one . I like it .\nProject Manager: Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We have to do our uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Say two .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nProject Manager: Okay , two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Two . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You ?\nUser Interface: One . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Me too . One .\nMarketing: One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next , six . It does not get lost easily .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Just a small thing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah . Yellow .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Looks like a pistol .\nProject Manager: Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .\nProject Manager: No . It won't get lost .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It won't .\nProject Manager: A one ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , o one .\nProject Manager: Okay , a one .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: Next .\nMarketing: Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .\nProject Manager: Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Me too .\nProject Manager: That was our target . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel .\nMarketing: Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T\nIndustrial Designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yes , a one .\nProject Manager: I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I think s two is better .\nUser Interface: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Two is okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .\nProject Manager: No , it's new . Innovation .\nMarketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm , three .\nProject Manager: Me too . Three .\nMarketing: A three .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .\nProject Manager: Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} .\nMarketing: So , we will do that . Yes .\nProject Manager: Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .\nMarketing: By nine .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Come on . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , nah . Okay .\nMarketing: So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's good .\nMarketing: So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think {gap} .\nMarketing: Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: And I closed your slide-show .\nProject Manager: Back to my uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .\nProject Manager: Yep . Next please .\nMarketing: Next . Finance .\nProject Manager: So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cheapest there is .\nProject Manager: Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .\nIndustrial Designer: Expensive .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it's the most advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the simple , regular and advanced .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} we have half rubber , half plastic .\nUser Interface: Mm , yes .\nProject Manager: No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yellow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: And it's not really a s\nIndustrial Designer: Joystick uh thing .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , no . It's too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh\nProject Manager: So , we have to change something .\nIndustrial Designer: What what are the costs ?\nProject Manager: Fifteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Fifteen .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour .\nMarketing: {gap} . We would have uh n\nIndustrial Designer: A special colour .\nProject Manager: Oh , no , we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .\nProject Manager: No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?\nMarketing: For a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} What ?\nMarketing: I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .\nProject Manager: Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ?\nProject Manager: That's one Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: One Euro discount . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .\nProject Manager: Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh .\nProject Manager: Then it's not good anymore .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yellow rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: No one will see it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , normal .\nIndustrial Designer: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And it's twelve Euros , I think .\nProject Manager: One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No . Uh , no , no , no .\nProject Manager: Or it's then a regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay then .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} .", "answers": ["The color of the prototype was yellow and the material was half rubber and half plastic with a company logo.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nGrad E: I guess .\nGrad A: OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .\nGrad E: Check one . Check one .\nGrad A: And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .\nGrad B: So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one .\nGrad A: Yep .\nGrad E: Sibilance . Sibilance .\nGrad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .\nGrad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?\nGrad A: No . No .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nGrad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .\nGrad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .\nGrad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .\nGrad B: For our stuff . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .\nProfessor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .\nGrad A: OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , we can start doing it .\nGrad A: Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh {disfmarker} So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form {disfmarker} I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?\nProfessor C: Um , yeah .\nGrad A: or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor C: No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?\nGrad B: I sent an email .\nProfessor C: She got an emai she was notified .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor C: Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ?\nGrad A: Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: So the\nProfessor C: OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Sure .\nGrad A: Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: Um , but uh ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .\nProfessor C: OK . Mm - hmm . No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor C: I just wanted to understand .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .\nGrad A: Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: but we find that {disfmarker} We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: and we don't want people to be editing what they say .\nGrad B: Right .\nGrad A: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly\nGrad A: OK . So th\nProfessor C: your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .\nGrad A: Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um . {vocalsound} There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're {disfmarker} we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh {disfmarker} and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to {disfmarker} to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor C: No .\nGrad A: OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . It should be on already . Um . Either one of those . And uh , read the digit strings and {disfmarker} and fill out the forms . So , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent .\nGrad B: I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late ,\nGrad A: Yeah .\nGrad B: so you will have to leave what you set .\nGrad A: Right . And uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad A: And {disfmarker} I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n {nonvocalsound} Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one . It 'll just be sitting here .\nGrad B: Input ? Yeah . There we go .\nProfessor C: By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: So , you know . Wow ! Organization . So you guys who got email about this {pause} oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to .\nGrad E: No .\nGrad F: No .\nGrad B: I got it .\nGrad E: What was the nature of the email ?\nProfessor C: Oh , this was about {pause} um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words , like \" s go to see \" , or \" visit \" , or some\nGrad B: Wel - we I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: You didn't get it ?\nGrad E: I don't think I did .\nProfessor C: I guess these g have got better filters . Cuz I sent it to everybody . You just blew it off .\nGrad E: Ah .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: It 's really simple though . So this is the idea . Um . We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's {disfmarker} it 's worth it but , uh , I think we {disfmarker} we will agree on that , um , to come up with a {disfmarker} with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some {disfmarker} some research , and some modeling . So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , um , and focus on that object down {disfmarker} Oh , I can actually walk with this . This is nice . down here . That 's the Powder - Tower . Now , um , {vocalsound} we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . And touch it . But you cannot enter or do anything else . Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there . It 's just a dark alley . But you can touch it . If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , {comment} you have to go this way , and go up here . And there you have a vre really view {disfmarker} It exploded , the {disfmarker} during the Thirty years - war . Really uh , interesting sight . And um , these uh {disfmarker} these lines are , um , paths ,\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: or so That 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part . Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take {disfmarker} to lead people this way . It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . So , {vocalsound} what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . Maybe you want to enter a building . Maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it . Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . For whatever reason that may be .\nGrad E: What 's it {disfmarker} what 's it made out of ?\nGrad B: Um , r red limestone .\nGrad E: So maybe you would wanna touch it .\nGrad B: Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . Um . Okay , I {disfmarker} This , um {disfmarker} These intentions , we {disfmarker} w w we could , if we want to , call it the {disfmarker} the Vista mode , where we just want to {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} s get the overview or look at it , the Enter mode , and the , well , Tango mode . I always come up with {disfmarker} with silly names . So this \" Tango \" means , literally translated , \" to touch \" . So {disfmarker} But sometimes the {disfmarker} the Tango mode is really relevant in the {disfmarker} in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh {disfmarker} If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some {disfmarker} Uh , I didn't look through all the data . um , and there {disfmarker} there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people {disfmarker} uh , the ways people phrase how to g get {disfmarker} if they want to get to a certain place . And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: No , OK come in , sit down . If you grab yourself a microphone .\nGrad B: You need to sign some stuff and read some digits .\nProfessor C: Well , you can sign afterwards .\nGrad B: O or later .\nGrad E: You have to al also have to read some digits .\nProfessor C: Afterwards .\nGrad D: OK . {comment} OK . Afterwards is fine .\nGrad B: They are uncomfortable . Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: Really small ? OK . I see . OK .\nGrad B: Yep .\nGrad D: Thank you .\nGrad B: OK , but that was our idea .\nProfessor C: And it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it it also has to be switched on , Nance .\nGrad B: Is {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: No , that one 's already on , I thought he said .\nProfessor C: It 's on ? OK , good .\nGrad D: OK . It 's on .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad B: OK . That was the idea . Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . Sometimes they want to enter it . And sometimes they want to get really close to it . That 's something we found . It 's just a truism . And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . I {disfmarker} I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where {disfmarker} if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may , uh {disfmarker} may phrase those requests to a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of {disfmarker} of these \" how do I get to \" , \" I want to go to \" , but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" I would like to see \" . And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the {disfmarker} the data {disfmarker} That was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . First of all , very important , and um , that {disfmarker} I 've completely forgot that when we talked . This is of course a crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \" So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of . Or very rarely . But you usually want to enter them . Some objects are more picturesque , and you {disfmarker} more f more highly photographed . Then of course the {disfmarker} the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . Um . Sometimes I found in the {disfmarker} Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that {disfmarker} that m may also give us a hint , um , \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh ? \" I need to get to \" . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and {disfmarker} and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of {disfmarker} of a phrase . So , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} My suggestion is really simple . We start with , um {disfmarker} Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these . So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure . Sort of action \" go \" , and then an object .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Yeah ? and a source . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . So , I thought , \" Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . \" Where we can start it and n sort of look {disfmarker} \" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . The crude , undifferentiated parse . Interpreted input . We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . We 'll see . And I will try to {disfmarker} to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . So this is not something which we can actually monitor , {vocalsound} now , but just is something we can set . And then you can all imagine sort of a {disfmarker} a constrained satisfaction program , depending on {disfmarker} on what , um , comes out . We want to have an {disfmarker} a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or {disfmarker} or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we {disfmarker} we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode . Which I think we maybe want to ignore . But . That 's my idea . It 's up for discussion . We can change all of it , any bit of it . Throw it all away .\nGrad F: Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually .\nProfessor C: What ?\nGrad F: Now I remember the email .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad E: Huh . Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email . I 'll have to go back and check .\nProfessor C: Not important . So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is . And , the {disfmarker} the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday . And we think it 's well - formed . So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .\nGrad F: So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ? Is it , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Well , it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's always all of it . So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep . But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . And , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to {disfmarker} Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it . It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . So , uh , and this is {disfmarker} Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gonna be contextual things , there 're gonna be linguistic things , there 're gonna be discourse things , and they gotta be combined . And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better . Um , the idea would be that {vocalsound} you , uh , take your {disfmarker} You 're editing your slide ?\nGrad B: Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas , uh w uh .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad B: So , discourse {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thought about that . Of course that needs to sort of go in there .\nProfessor C: Oh . I 'm sorry . OK . So . This is minutes {disfmarker} taking minutes as we go , in his {disfmarker} in his own way .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: Um , but the p the {disfmarker} Anyway . So the thing is , {vocalsound} i uh , d naively speaking , you 've {disfmarker} you 've got a {disfmarker} for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to {disfmarker} uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . Um . So that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . And , then the question is {disfmarker} there are two questions {disfmarker} is , uh , one , where do you get this i {comment} information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? And you probably need intermediate nodes . I {disfmarker} we don't know what they are yet . So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether {disfmarker} Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day . Now , they may wanna call that part of context .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But the time of day matters a lot . And , if things are obviously closed , then , you {disfmarker}\nGrad B: People won't want to enter it .\nProfessor C: Pe - people don't wanna enter them . And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed {disfmarker} you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .\nGrad B: s b\nProfessor C: So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a {disfmarker} more of a dialogue . So if someone says something you could ask them .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . And {disfmarker} Now , one thing you could do is always ask them , but that 's boring . And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it . So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , \" whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers . Ask them which one you want . \" OK . But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do .\nGrad B: But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call .\nProfessor C: Oh yeah . You want the {disfmarker} you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask , but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time , and i That 's not getting at the scientific problem ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: and it 's {disfmarker} In general you 're {disfmarker} you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that . a This is purposely a really simple case .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So , uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad B: I have one more point to {disfmarker} to Bhaskara 's question . Um , I think also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the deep understanding part of it is {disfmarker} is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling . We can start , you know , basic from human beings , model that , its motions , going , walking , seeing , we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . That will be extremely deep in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in my understanding .\nProfessor C: Yeah . S so {disfmarker} so the way that might come up , if you wanna {disfmarker} Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , \" Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? \" OK ? And if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ? Or is there a focus on the path ? or something . And that could be , uh , one of the conditiona you know , th the {disfmarker} In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the {disfmarker} the appropriate thing to enter .\nGrad F: So , where would we extract that information from ? From the M - three - L ?\nProfessor C: No . No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th What he was saying is , the M - three - L does not have any of that . All it has is some really crude stuff saying , \" A person wants to go to a place . \"\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ?\nProfessor C: Right . M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language .\nGrad E: OK . It 's just a language . Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: So we have th w we we we have to have a better w way of referring to {disfmarker}\nGrad B: The parser output ?\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: \" Analyzed speech \" I think it 's what they call it ,\nProfessor C: Yeah . The {disfmarker} Well , OK .\nGrad B: really , oder {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gonna get .\nProfessor C: Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice , but tha\nGrad B: In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis .\nProfessor C: Anyway .\nGrad B: They call it intention hypotheses .\nProfessor C: Right . So , th they 're gonna give us some cr uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} We can assume that y you get this crude information . About intention , and that 's all they 're going to provide . And they don't give you the kind of object , they don't give you any discourse history , if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else .\nGrad B: Well , they keep it . We have to request it .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Nuh ? But it 's not in there .\nProfessor C: Well , they {disfmarker} they kee they keep it by their lights .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nProfessor C: It may {disfmarker} it may or may not be what {disfmarker} what we want .\nGrad B: Yeah , or i\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: So , if someone says , \" I wanna touch the side of the Powder - Tower \" , that would {disfmarker} basically , we need to pop up Tango mode and the {disfmarker} and the directions ?\nProfessor C: If i if {disfmarker} Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: But it wouldn't .\nGrad E: OK . But that doesn't necessarily {disfmarker} But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for touching the side , right ?\nGrad B: Well {disfmarker} Uh , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . Correct ? Um , because um , sometimes people just say things {disfmarker} This you find very often . \" Where is the city hall ? \" And this do they don't wanna sh see it on a map , or they don't wanna know it 's five hundred yards away from you , or that it 's to the {disfmarker} your north . They wanna go there . That 's what they say , is , \" Where is it ? \" . Where is that damn thing ?\nGrad E: And the parser would output {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Well , that 's a {disfmarker} a question mark . sh A lot of parsers , um , just , uh {disfmarker} That 's way beyond their scope , is {disfmarker} of interpreting that . You know ? But um , still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure , with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a WH focus on the town hall . But to interpret it ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: you know ? somebody else has to do that job later .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output , depending on these things .\nGrad B: Um , it will probably tell you how far away it is , at least that 's {disfmarker} That 's even what Deep Map does . It tells you how far away it is , and {disfmarker} and shows it to you on a map . Because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where {disfmarker} where it is .\nGrad D: People no might not be able to infer that either , right ? Like the fact {disfmarker} Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , \" Where 's the city hall ? \" , I might say , g ar \" Are you trying to get there ? \" Because how I describe um , t its location {disfmarker} uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , \" It 's half a mile away \" or something like that .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .  It 's a granularity factor ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: because where people ask you , \" Where is New York ? \" , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast .\nGrad D: Uh - huh . Yeah . Exactly . Right . Right .\nGrad B: Y y eh {disfmarker} you won't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there .\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: So th They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: So .\nGrad D: Right .\nProfessor C: But {disfmarker} i Go {disfmarker} go back to the {disfmarker} the uh , th\nGrad B: So I w this is {disfmarker} \" onto \" is {disfmarker} is knowledge about buildings ,\nProfessor C: Yeah , that slide .\nGrad B: their opening times , and then t coupled with time of day , um , this should {disfmarker} You know .\nGrad D: So that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context , i like business or travel , as well as the utterance context , like , \" I 'm now standing at this place at this time \" .\nProfessor C: Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We {disfmarker} we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context , which is what you have as context , and discourse context ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: which you have as DH ,\nGrad B: Nuh .\nProfessor C: I don't know what the H means .\nGrad B: History . Discourse history . Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . Whatever . So we can work out terminology later .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: So , they 're {disfmarker} they 're quite distinct . I mean , you need them both , but they 're quite distinct . And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics . Except to find out what seems to be {pause} useful . So , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be {disfmarker} Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea , but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , given these {disfmarker} We have all these transcripts and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . Saying , \" Aha ! here 're the things which , if you get them out of {disfmarker} out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . \" And if {disfmarker} to actually do that , build it , um {disfmarker} you know , run it {disfmarker} y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters . And see how that goes . If that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . So {disfmarker} where would you get this information ? And , expand it to {disfmarker} to other things like this . But if we can't do that , then we 're in trouble . I mean th th i i if you can't do this task , um {disfmarker}\nGrad B: We need a different , uh , engine . Machine , I mean .\nProfessor C: Uh , uh , yeah , or something . Well it {disfmarker} i I if it {disfmarker} if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , but I don't think that 's gonna be the case . I think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ? And I don't know .\nGrad B: Hmm . But , only w\nProfessor C: Hold on a s Hold on a second .\nGrad B: Muh .\nProfessor C: So , I know . Uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ?\nGrad F: Yep .\nGrad D: Um , I missed the beginning , but , um I guess {disfmarker} could you back to the slide , the previous one ? So , is it that it 's , um {disfmarker} These are all factors that uh , a These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ? or that we want to {vocalsound} take into account ? You were saying n\nProfessor C: Take them into account . But {disfmarker} but you don't worry about {disfmarker} h\nGrad D: Take the {disfmarker} the linguistic factors too . Oh , how to extract these features .\nProfessor C: how to extract them . So , f let 's find out which ones we need first ,\nGrad D: OK . Got it .\nProfessor C: and {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK . And {disfmarker} and it 's clear from the data , um , like , sorta the correct answer in each case .\nProfessor C: No .\nGrad D: But l\nGrad B: No . But {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the slide of data .\nGrad D: That 's {disfmarker} that 's the thing I 'm curious ab\nGrad B: Um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Like do we know from the data wh which {disfmarker} OK . So {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Not from that data . But , um , since we are designing a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , {comment} um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: in some shape , way , form over the other ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Um , from this , we can sometimes , you know {disfmarker} an and that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} but that {disfmarker} isn't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ? is sort of {disfmarker} s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Right .\nGrad B: you know ?\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net . So , um , this is exactly what {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Because y you can never be sure . And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , \" Well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . \"\nGrad D: Sure .\nGrad B: You know , because then , uh , you {disfmarker}\nGrad D: u u I mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task . Right ? Where you have {disfmarker} where your , uh , current goal is to {disfmarker}\nGrad B: We Yeah ! That 's what we 're doing .\nGrad D: \nGrad B: But {disfmarker} but we will still get the phrasing all over the place .\nGrad D: So that 's what you want ? OK . So you will know .\nGrad B: I 'm sure that , you know {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . The {disfmarker} No , that 's fine . I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: From that task , yeah . So , uh , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room\nGrad D: \nProfessor C: and start recording subjects probably within a month or something . So , this is not any {disfmarker} lo any of you guys ' worry , except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need . So our job {vocalsound} is to figure out how to solve these problems . If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that . And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects . So , yeah {disfmarker} y you 're absolutely right , though . No , you {disfmarker} you will not have , and there it is , and , uh {disfmarker} But you know , y y the , um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: And I think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} I don't know if this was collected {disfmarker} what situation this data was collected in . Was it {disfmarker} is it the one that you showed in your talk ? Like people {disfmarker}\nGrad B: No , no . No .\nGrad D: But OK . So was this , like , someone actually mobile , like {disfmarker} s using a device ?\nGrad B: Uh , N no , no not {disfmarker} i it was mobile but not {disfmarker} not with a w a real wizard system . So there were never answers .\nGrad D: Uh - huh . OK . OK . But , is it {disfmarker} I guess I don't know {disfmarker} The situation of {disfmarker} of collecting th the data of , like {disfmarker} Here you could imagine them being {disfmarker} walking around the city . as like one situation . And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: If they 're doing it in a {disfmarker} you know , \" I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions \" , I {disfmarker} I would imagine that the data would be really different . Um , so it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah . But {disfmarker} It was never th th the goal of that data collection to {disfmarker} to serve for sat for such a purpose . So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: there was n there was no label ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: you know , intention A , intention B , intention C .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Or task A , B , C . Um I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it , um , that {disfmarker} that will help us along those lines .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: But , you know , you gotta leave something for other people to model . So , to {disfmarker} Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: what suffices and what doesn't . And then we can start worrying about where to get this input , what {disfmarker} what do we need , you know {disfmarker} Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Hmm .\nGrad B: It 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment .\nGrad E: How exactly does the data collection work ? Do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ?\nGrad B: OK . Imagine you 're the {disfmarker} the subject . You 're gonna be in here , and somebody {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and you see , uh , either th the three - D model , or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg . So you actually see that . Um . The uh , um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg . So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth . So that 's part one . Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , and it understands you completely . And so you 're gonna pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve . First you have to know {disfmarker} find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . Maybe {disfmarker} So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . The third one is to get information on the history of an object . The fourth one {disfmarker} And then the g system breaks down . It crashes , And {disfmarker}\nGrad D: a At the third ? Right then ?\nGrad B: After the third task .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad B: And then {disfmarker} Or after the fourth . Some find {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Forget that for now . And then , a human operator comes on , and {disfmarker} and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . And so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . Oh , and one {disfmarker} one little bit {disfmarker} w And uh , the computer you are {disfmarker} you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS . When the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know . So the GPS is crashed as well . So the person first has to ask you \" Where are you ? \" . And so you have to do some {disfmarker} s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . Um , this is a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a bit that I d I don't think we {disfmarker} Did we discuss that bit ? Uh , I just sort of squeezed that in now . But it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know . So .\nGrad D: So , in the display you can {disfmarker} Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah . a Additionally , y you have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a sort of a map type display .\nGrad D: a w your perspective ? sort of ?\nGrad B: Uh , two - D .\nGrad D: And so , as you {disfmarker}\nGrad B: n\nGrad D: Oh , two - D . OK .\nGrad B: Two - D .\nGrad D: So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the {disfmarker} for themselves\nGrad B: Yeah . b y You don't {disfmarker} That 's {disfmarker}\nGrad D: there .\nGrad B: I don't know . I but y I don't think you really move , sort of .\nGrad D: OK . So\nGrad B: Yeah ? I mean that would be an {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} an enormous technical effort , unless we would {disfmarker} We can show it walks to , you know . We can have movies of walking , you walking through {disfmarker} through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Maybe we wanna do that . Yeah .\nGrad D: Uh , I was just trying to figure out how {disfmarker} how ambitious the system is .\nGrad B: The map was sort of intended to {disfmarker} You want to go to that place . You know , and it 's sort of there .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: And you see the label of the name {disfmarker} So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . So your tasks don't require you to {disfmarker} I mean , uh {disfmarker} yo you 're told {disfmarker} So when your task is , I don't know , \" Go buy stamps \" or something like that ? So , do you have to respond ? or does your {disfmarker} Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w what you 're doing now ? or {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Well , we 'll see what people do .\nGrad D: There 's no {disfmarker} OK , so it 's just like , \" Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances \" .\nGrad B: Yeah , and {disfmarker} and we will record both sides . I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nGrad B: I mean , in both cases it 's gonna be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case .\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nGrad B: And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? So , you first have to do this , and that ,\nGrad D: Yep .\nGrad B: and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: see wh what they say . We can ins instruct the , uh , wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be . But um , maybe the {disfmarker} maybe what you 're suggesting {disfmarker} Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? You wanna m have it more {disfmarker} more steps , sort of ?\nGrad D: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction {disfmarker} I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Oh yeah , but {disfmarker} to some extent this is a different discussion .\nGrad D: Right ? So {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK ? So . Uh , we {disfmarker} we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard . Uh , she 's gonna get in touch with me . It 's a student of Eve 's . FEY , Fey ? Spelled FEY . Do you {disfmarker} do you {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Oh , Fey Parrill .\nProfessor C: You know her ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: OK . Sh - Is sh\nGrad D: She started taking the class last year and then didn't {disfmarker} um , you know , didn't continue . I g She 's a g\nProfessor C: She 's graduated .\nGrad D: Is she an undergradua She is a graduate , OK .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad D: Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that .\nProfessor C: OK . So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school . And she 'll be in touch . So we may have someone , uh , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in {disfmarker} in all this stuff . And is a linguist st and , so So . {vocalsound} That 's {disfmarker} So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mmm .\nProfessor C: So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing .\nGrad D: OK . I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , but with intention {vocalsound} um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors and {disfmarker} I 'm not really sure , um , how {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that {disfmarker} Um , it 's ju it 's just hard . So , I mean , obviously it 's a {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , uh , actually I guess that was my question . Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ? Like , do the {disfmarker}\nGrad D: It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was .\nGrad D: to {disfmarker} to give {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: n No one is , at the moment .\nGrad D: Right . Right .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .\nGrad D: Right .\nProfessor C: But , uh ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: the {disfmarker} The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention , and set the context , and know what language was used . So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data . Um . The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .\nGrad D: w What are the t three intentions ? Is it to go there , to see it , and {disfmarker}\nGrad B: To come as close as possible to it .\nProfessor C: Th - the terminology we 're using is to {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Yeah , it 's @ @ .\nProfessor C: Go back . To v\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: to View it . OK ? To Enter it . Now those {disfmarker} It seems to me those are cl you c you have no trouble with those being distinct . \" Take a picture of it \" you {disfmarker} you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And , for an object that 's at all big , uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh , could be quite different than either of those .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Just sort of {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK , so now I understand the referent of Tango mode . I didn't get that before .\nGrad E: See , I would have thought it was more of a waltz .\nGrad B: S To \" Waltz \" it ?\nGrad D: Yeah , like , how close are you gonna be ?\nProfessor C: Well .\nGrad D: Like , {vocalsound} Tango 's really close .\nGrad E: Yeah , cuz a tango {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , anyway . So {disfmarker}\nGrad F: All these So , like , the question is how what features can {disfmarker} like , do you wanna try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ?\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: Like , the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh , stem , or {disfmarker} certain construction or whatever .\nProfessor C: Right . Is there a construction , or the kind of object , or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the {disfmarker} in the s the discourse itself or in the context . So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature . Now , how you determine that is another issue . But fo for the current problem , it would just be , \" OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , \" or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , \" pppt ! \" Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .\nGrad F: Right . So , how should {disfmarker} What 's the uh , plan ? Like , how should we go about figuring out these {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK . So , first of all is , uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? JavaBayes or something ?\nGrad F: Oh . No , not really .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , anyway . f Get one . OK ? So {disfmarker} y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package , doesn't matter which one , uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . d w These are not gonna get big in {disfmarker} in the foreseeable future . But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . Because i that 's {disfmarker} A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , um , playing with this . And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files . So that if {disfmarker} if we have all these cases {disfmarker} OK ? So we make up cases that have these features , OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , \" OK , here 's a bunch of cases \" {disfmarker} There 're even ones tha that you can do learning OK ? So you have all their cases and {disfmarker} and their results and you have a {disfmarker} algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the {disfmarker} the probabilities for you . Um , probably that 's not worth it . I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the {disfmarker} these data fitting ones worth it , but I don't know . So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package . OK , and you wanna it s You know , the standard things you want it stable , you want it {disfmarker} yeah , @ @ . And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on .\nGrad B: An - Nuh .\nProfessor C: But it {disfmarker} what I like about it is it 's very concrete . OK ? We {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} we know what the outcomes are gonna be , and we have some {disfmarker} some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition , and see how hard it is , and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . So it {disfmarker} if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to {disfmarker} You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: And it {disfmarker} and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis . I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , that are contained in the data , um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them . And {disfmarker} and that altogether could also be {disfmarker} uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it . And um {disfmarker} When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language Java ?\nProfessor C: No , th It turns out that there is a , uh {disfmarker} The new end of Java libraries . OK , and it turns out one called\nGrad B: Mmm . OK .\nProfessor C: Which is one that fair {disfmarker} people around here use a fair amount . I have no idea whether that 's {disfmarker}  The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So that i that 's I think why a lot of people doing research use that . But it may not be {disfmarker} I have no idea whether that 's the best choice an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets . So , uh ,\nGrad D: There 's the m tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed ,\nProfessor C: Right . It 's OK .\nGrad D: which might be useful too .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with .\nGrad D: And it 's available Matlab code .\nProfessor C: Nancy knows him well . I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: but , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah , I know him .\nGrad B: But i But since we all probably are pretty sure that , um , the {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: For example , this th th the dialogue history is {disfmarker} is um , producing XML documents . M - three - L of course is XML . And the ontology that um , uh the student is {disfmarker} is constructing for me back in {disfmarker} in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML . And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nGrad B: Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able {disfmarker} We can couple .\nProfessor C: Yeah . So , yeah , we 're sort of {nonvocalsound} committed to XML as the kind of , uh , interchange . But that 's , you know , not a big deal .\nGrad B: Who isn't , nuh ?\nProfessor C: So , in terms of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} interchanging in and out of any module we build , It 'll be XML . And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's fine an and um , all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind . So they {disfmarker} they have worked very hard . It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth . So , that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet . I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML , um , little descriptors . I believe .\nGrad B: Hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I like , for example , the {disfmarker} what you said about the getting input from {disfmarker} from just files about where you h where you have the data , have specified the features and so forth .\nProfessor C: I don't {disfmarker} I don't see {disfmarker}\nGrad B: That 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , XML .\nProfessor C: Uh , you could have an X {disfmarker} yeah , you could make and XML format for that . Sure .\nGrad B: So r\nProfessor C: That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} um , you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any . So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that um , do things you 'd like .\nGrad F: Doesn't {disfmarker} does SmartKom system have such packages ?\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Sure .\nGrad B: The {disfmarker} the lib M - three - L library does that . It 's also {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: And the question is , d you c you {disfmarker} you 'll have to l We 'll have to l That should be {disfmarker} ay We should be able to look at that {disfmarker}\nGrad B: No , u u y um the {disfmarker} What I {disfmarker} What sort of came to my mind i is {disfmarker} was the notion of an idea that if {disfmarker} if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um , probability factors based on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on input {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: which is in file format , if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some {disfmarker} some corpora that other people made and , for example , if {disfmarker} if they are in {disfmarker} in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Um , Michael has a project where {disfmarker} you know , recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE , and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data . So if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not {disfmarker} not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of {disfmarker} of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: It 'd be nice , but {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do I don't wanna count on it . I mean , you can't {disfmarker} you can't run your project based on the speculation that {disfmarker} that the data will come ,\nGrad B: No , no , uh , just for {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: and you don't have to actually design the nets .\nGrad B: Nuh . Just a back door that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think we should devote m\nProfessor C: Could happen . Yeah . So in terms of {disfmarker} of the , um {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . You don't {disfmarker} You know , you don't really like it . So we 're not {disfmarker} we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages . We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format , but hey .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: Um , it 's , uh {disfmarker} It doesn't control what you do in you know , internally .\nGrad B: \nGrad E: What 's the time frame for this ?\nGrad B: Two days ? Two , three days ?\nProfessor C: Huh ? Yeah bu w I 'd like that this {disfmarker} y yeah , this week , to ha to n to {vocalsound} have y guys , uh , you know , pick {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} y you know , belief - net package\nGrad B: No .\nProfessor C: and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something .\nGrad F: Sure .\nProfessor C: And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem . Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on , and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way . I mean , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site or {disfmarker} You know , how\nGrad B: Uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} um , OK , I {disfmarker} t Yeah . I was actually more joking . With the two or three days . So this was {disfmarker} was a usual jo\nProfessor C: OK , I wasn't .\nGrad B: Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Right .\nGrad B: But um , maybe it might be interesting if {disfmarker} if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked , and what it does , and how it does that .\nProfessor C: Well , y Well , or both of them speak .\nGrad F: Sure .\nGrad B: Yeah , or you can split it up .\nProfessor C: We don't care .\nGrad B: So , y\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad B: So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} for slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and {disfmarker} and how far you 've gotten . Pppt !\nProfessor C: Well , I 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . Even if it 's really crude . OK ? So , you know , here a here are {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot ,\nProfessor C: Right . Yeah .\nGrad E: and {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is , I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , \" Here 's the package , here 's the current one we have , \" uh , you know , \" What other ideas do you have ? \" and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file . Of , uh , you know , get a {disfmarker} t a p tentative format for it , let 's say XML , that says , l you know , \" These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . \" We can just add to that and there 'll be this {disfmarker} this file of them and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this , um {disfmarker} this data file .\nGrad F: So we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities .\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah , unt until we know more .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: And what 's the relation to this with {disfmarker} Changing the table so that the system works in English ?\nGrad B: OK . So this is {disfmarker} Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails . The {disfmarker} the full NT and the full Linux version are there . I 've downloaded them both , and I started to unpack the Linux one {disfmarker} Uh , the NT one worked fine . and I started unta pack the Linux one , it told me that I can't really unpack it because it contains a future date . So this is the time difference between Germany . I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it . Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we {disfmarker} I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .\nGrad E: I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker} You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad B: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,\nGrad F: Mmm .\nGrad B: which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .\nGrad D: Oh , really ?\nGrad B: So . Um {disfmarker} So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} because car navigation systems don't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad B: But even that is problematic .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad B: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ?\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .\nGrad D: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .\nGrad B: Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Clear ?\nGrad F: OK . Sounds good .\nGrad E: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .\nGrad D: I was wondering .\nGrad B: Do you wanna see a picture ?\nGrad D: OK . Sure !\nGrad E: Sure !\nGrad B: Have to reboot for that though .\nGrad D: Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?\nProfessor C: Of course they use the sample data .\nGrad D: Is it like {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker} Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?\nGrad B: There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . \"\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .\nGrad B: Talk features . Yep .\nProfessor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .\nGrad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .\nProfessor C: Uh , is that OK ?\nGrad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .\nProfessor C: Alright . Oh . Ni\nGrad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .\nGrad B: Ahh .\nGrad E: OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .\nGrad D: That 's right , OK .\nGrad B: Mmm .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did C think about setting up the recording equipment?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did C think about setting up the recording equipment?", "context": "Grad E: I guess .\nGrad A: OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .\nGrad E: Check one . Check one .\nGrad A: And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .\nGrad B: So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one .\nGrad A: Yep .\nGrad E: Sibilance . Sibilance .\nGrad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .\nGrad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?\nGrad A: No . No .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nGrad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .\nGrad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .\nGrad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .\nGrad B: For our stuff . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad A: So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .\nProfessor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .\nGrad A: OK . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , we can start doing it .\nGrad A: Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh {disfmarker} So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form {disfmarker} I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?\nProfessor C: Um , yeah .\nGrad A: or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor C: No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?\nGrad B: I sent an email .\nProfessor C: She got an emai she was notified .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor C: Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ?\nGrad A: Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: So the\nProfessor C: OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}\nGrad A: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Sure .\nGrad A: Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: Um , but uh ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .\nProfessor C: OK . Mm - hmm . No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,\nGrad A: Yep .\nProfessor C: I just wanted to understand .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .\nGrad A: Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad A: but we find that {disfmarker} We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad A: and we don't want people to be editing what they say .\nGrad B: Right .\nGrad A: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly\nGrad A: OK . So th\nProfessor C: your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .\nGrad A: Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um . {vocalsound} There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're {disfmarker} we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh {disfmarker} and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to {disfmarker} to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad A: Anything else ?\nProfessor C: No .\nGrad A: OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . It should be on already . Um . Either one of those . And uh , read the digit strings and {disfmarker} and fill out the forms . So , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent .\nGrad B: I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late ,\nGrad A: Yeah .\nGrad B: so you will have to leave what you set .\nGrad A: Right . And uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad A: And {disfmarker} I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n {nonvocalsound} Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one . It 'll just be sitting here .\nGrad B: Input ? Yeah . There we go .\nProfessor C: By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: So , you know . Wow ! Organization . So you guys who got email about this {pause} oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to .\nGrad E: No .\nGrad F: No .\nGrad B: I got it .\nGrad E: What was the nature of the email ?\nProfessor C: Oh , this was about {pause} um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words , like \" s go to see \" , or \" visit \" , or some\nGrad B: Wel - we I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: You didn't get it ?\nGrad E: I don't think I did .\nProfessor C: I guess these g have got better filters . Cuz I sent it to everybody . You just blew it off .\nGrad E: Ah .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad B: It 's really simple though . So this is the idea . Um . We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's {disfmarker} it 's worth it but , uh , I think we {disfmarker} we will agree on that , um , to come up with a {disfmarker} with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some {disfmarker} some research , and some modeling . So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , um , and focus on that object down {disfmarker} Oh , I can actually walk with this . This is nice . down here . That 's the Powder - Tower . Now , um , {vocalsound} we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . And touch it . But you cannot enter or do anything else . Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there . It 's just a dark alley . But you can touch it . If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , {comment} you have to go this way , and go up here . And there you have a vre really view {disfmarker} It exploded , the {disfmarker} during the Thirty years - war . Really uh , interesting sight . And um , these uh {disfmarker} these lines are , um , paths ,\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: or so That 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part . Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take {disfmarker} to lead people this way . It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . So , {vocalsound} what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . Maybe you want to enter a building . Maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it . Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . For whatever reason that may be .\nGrad E: What 's it {disfmarker} what 's it made out of ?\nGrad B: Um , r red limestone .\nGrad E: So maybe you would wanna touch it .\nGrad B: Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . Um . Okay , I {disfmarker} This , um {disfmarker} These intentions , we {disfmarker} w w we could , if we want to , call it the {disfmarker} the Vista mode , where we just want to {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} s get the overview or look at it , the Enter mode , and the , well , Tango mode . I always come up with {disfmarker} with silly names . So this \" Tango \" means , literally translated , \" to touch \" . So {disfmarker} But sometimes the {disfmarker} the Tango mode is really relevant in the {disfmarker} in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh {disfmarker} If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some {disfmarker} Uh , I didn't look through all the data . um , and there {disfmarker} there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people {disfmarker} uh , the ways people phrase how to g get {disfmarker} if they want to get to a certain place . And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: No , OK come in , sit down . If you grab yourself a microphone .\nGrad B: You need to sign some stuff and read some digits .\nProfessor C: Well , you can sign afterwards .\nGrad B: O or later .\nGrad E: You have to al also have to read some digits .\nProfessor C: Afterwards .\nGrad D: OK . {comment} OK . Afterwards is fine .\nGrad B: They are uncomfortable . Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: Really small ? OK . I see . OK .\nGrad B: Yep .\nGrad D: Thank you .\nGrad B: OK , but that was our idea .\nProfessor C: And it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it it also has to be switched on , Nance .\nGrad B: Is {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: No , that one 's already on , I thought he said .\nProfessor C: It 's on ? OK , good .\nGrad D: OK . It 's on .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nGrad B: OK . That was the idea . Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . Sometimes they want to enter it . And sometimes they want to get really close to it . That 's something we found . It 's just a truism . And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . I {disfmarker} I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where {disfmarker} if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may , uh {disfmarker} may phrase those requests to a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of {disfmarker} of these \" how do I get to \" , \" I want to go to \" , but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" I would like to see \" . And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the {disfmarker} the data {disfmarker} That was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . First of all , very important , and um , that {disfmarker} I 've completely forgot that when we talked . This is of course a crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \" So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of . Or very rarely . But you usually want to enter them . Some objects are more picturesque , and you {disfmarker} more f more highly photographed . Then of course the {disfmarker} the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . Um . Sometimes I found in the {disfmarker} Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that {disfmarker} that m may also give us a hint , um , \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh ? \" I need to get to \" . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and {disfmarker} and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of {disfmarker} of a phrase . So , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} My suggestion is really simple . We start with , um {disfmarker} Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these . So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure . Sort of action \" go \" , and then an object .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Yeah ? and a source . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . So , I thought , \" Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . \" Where we can start it and n sort of look {disfmarker} \" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . The crude , undifferentiated parse . Interpreted input . We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . We 'll see . And I will try to {disfmarker} to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . So this is not something which we can actually monitor , {vocalsound} now , but just is something we can set . And then you can all imagine sort of a {disfmarker} a constrained satisfaction program , depending on {disfmarker} on what , um , comes out . We want to have an {disfmarker} a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or {disfmarker} or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we {disfmarker} we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode . Which I think we maybe want to ignore . But . That 's my idea . It 's up for discussion . We can change all of it , any bit of it . Throw it all away .\nGrad F: Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually .\nProfessor C: What ?\nGrad F: Now I remember the email .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad E: Huh . Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email . I 'll have to go back and check .\nProfessor C: Not important . So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is . And , the {disfmarker} the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday . And we think it 's well - formed . So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .\nGrad F: So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ? Is it , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Well , it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's always all of it . So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep . But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . And , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to {disfmarker} Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it . It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . So , uh , and this is {disfmarker} Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gonna be contextual things , there 're gonna be linguistic things , there 're gonna be discourse things , and they gotta be combined . And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better . Um , the idea would be that {vocalsound} you , uh , take your {disfmarker} You 're editing your slide ?\nGrad B: Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas , uh w uh .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad B: So , discourse {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thought about that . Of course that needs to sort of go in there .\nProfessor C: Oh . I 'm sorry . OK . So . This is minutes {disfmarker} taking minutes as we go , in his {disfmarker} in his own way .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: Um , but the p the {disfmarker} Anyway . So the thing is , {vocalsound} i uh , d naively speaking , you 've {disfmarker} you 've got a {disfmarker} for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to {disfmarker} uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . Um . So that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . And , then the question is {disfmarker} there are two questions {disfmarker} is , uh , one , where do you get this i {comment} information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? And you probably need intermediate nodes . I {disfmarker} we don't know what they are yet . So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether {disfmarker} Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day . Now , they may wanna call that part of context .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But the time of day matters a lot . And , if things are obviously closed , then , you {disfmarker}\nGrad B: People won't want to enter it .\nProfessor C: Pe - people don't wanna enter them . And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed {disfmarker} you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .\nGrad B: s b\nProfessor C: So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a {disfmarker} more of a dialogue . So if someone says something you could ask them .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . And {disfmarker} Now , one thing you could do is always ask them , but that 's boring . And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it . So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , \" whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers . Ask them which one you want . \" OK . But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do .\nGrad B: But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call .\nProfessor C: Oh yeah . You want the {disfmarker} you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask , but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time , and i That 's not getting at the scientific problem ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: and it 's {disfmarker} In general you 're {disfmarker} you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that . a This is purposely a really simple case .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So , uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad B: I have one more point to {disfmarker} to Bhaskara 's question . Um , I think also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the deep understanding part of it is {disfmarker} is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling . We can start , you know , basic from human beings , model that , its motions , going , walking , seeing , we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . That will be extremely deep in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in my understanding .\nProfessor C: Yeah . S so {disfmarker} so the way that might come up , if you wanna {disfmarker} Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , \" Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? \" OK ? And if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ? Or is there a focus on the path ? or something . And that could be , uh , one of the conditiona you know , th the {disfmarker} In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the {disfmarker} the appropriate thing to enter .\nGrad F: So , where would we extract that information from ? From the M - three - L ?\nProfessor C: No . No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th What he was saying is , the M - three - L does not have any of that . All it has is some really crude stuff saying , \" A person wants to go to a place . \"\nGrad F: Right .\nGrad E: The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ?\nProfessor C: Right . M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language .\nGrad E: OK . It 's just a language . Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: So we have th w we we we have to have a better w way of referring to {disfmarker}\nGrad B: The parser output ?\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: \" Analyzed speech \" I think it 's what they call it ,\nProfessor C: Yeah . The {disfmarker} Well , OK .\nGrad B: really , oder {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gonna get .\nProfessor C: Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice , but tha\nGrad B: In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis .\nProfessor C: Anyway .\nGrad B: They call it intention hypotheses .\nProfessor C: Right . So , th they 're gonna give us some cr uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} We can assume that y you get this crude information . About intention , and that 's all they 're going to provide . And they don't give you the kind of object , they don't give you any discourse history , if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else .\nGrad B: Well , they keep it . We have to request it .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: Nuh ? But it 's not in there .\nProfessor C: Well , they {disfmarker} they kee they keep it by their lights .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nProfessor C: It may {disfmarker} it may or may not be what {disfmarker} what we want .\nGrad B: Yeah , or i\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: So , if someone says , \" I wanna touch the side of the Powder - Tower \" , that would {disfmarker} basically , we need to pop up Tango mode and the {disfmarker} and the directions ?\nProfessor C: If i if {disfmarker} Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: But it wouldn't .\nGrad E: OK . But that doesn't necessarily {disfmarker} But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for touching the side , right ?\nGrad B: Well {disfmarker} Uh , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . Correct ? Um , because um , sometimes people just say things {disfmarker} This you find very often . \" Where is the city hall ? \" And this do they don't wanna sh see it on a map , or they don't wanna know it 's five hundred yards away from you , or that it 's to the {disfmarker} your north . They wanna go there . That 's what they say , is , \" Where is it ? \" . Where is that damn thing ?\nGrad E: And the parser would output {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Well , that 's a {disfmarker} a question mark . sh A lot of parsers , um , just , uh {disfmarker} That 's way beyond their scope , is {disfmarker} of interpreting that . You know ? But um , still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure , with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a WH focus on the town hall . But to interpret it ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: you know ? somebody else has to do that job later .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output , depending on these things .\nGrad B: Um , it will probably tell you how far away it is , at least that 's {disfmarker} That 's even what Deep Map does . It tells you how far away it is , and {disfmarker} and shows it to you on a map . Because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where {disfmarker} where it is .\nGrad D: People no might not be able to infer that either , right ? Like the fact {disfmarker} Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , \" Where 's the city hall ? \" , I might say , g ar \" Are you trying to get there ? \" Because how I describe um , t its location {disfmarker} uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , \" It 's half a mile away \" or something like that .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .  It 's a granularity factor ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: because where people ask you , \" Where is New York ? \" , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast .\nGrad D: Uh - huh . Yeah . Exactly . Right . Right .\nGrad B: Y y eh {disfmarker} you won't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there .\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: So th They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: So .\nGrad D: Right .\nProfessor C: But {disfmarker} i Go {disfmarker} go back to the {disfmarker} the uh , th\nGrad B: So I w this is {disfmarker} \" onto \" is {disfmarker} is knowledge about buildings ,\nProfessor C: Yeah , that slide .\nGrad B: their opening times , and then t coupled with time of day , um , this should {disfmarker} You know .\nGrad D: So that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context , i like business or travel , as well as the utterance context , like , \" I 'm now standing at this place at this time \" .\nProfessor C: Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We {disfmarker} we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context , which is what you have as context , and discourse context ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: which you have as DH ,\nGrad B: Nuh .\nProfessor C: I don't know what the H means .\nGrad B: History . Discourse history . Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . Whatever . So we can work out terminology later .\nGrad B: Yep .\nProfessor C: So , they 're {disfmarker} they 're quite distinct . I mean , you need them both , but they 're quite distinct . And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics . Except to find out what seems to be {pause} useful . So , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be {disfmarker} Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea , but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , given these {disfmarker} We have all these transcripts and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . Saying , \" Aha ! here 're the things which , if you get them out of {disfmarker} out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . \" And if {disfmarker} to actually do that , build it , um {disfmarker} you know , run it {disfmarker} y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters . And see how that goes . If that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . So {disfmarker} where would you get this information ? And , expand it to {disfmarker} to other things like this . But if we can't do that , then we 're in trouble . I mean th th i i if you can't do this task , um {disfmarker}\nGrad B: We need a different , uh , engine . Machine , I mean .\nProfessor C: Uh , uh , yeah , or something . Well it {disfmarker} i I if it {disfmarker} if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , but I don't think that 's gonna be the case . I think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ? And I don't know .\nGrad B: Hmm . But , only w\nProfessor C: Hold on a s Hold on a second .\nGrad B: Muh .\nProfessor C: So , I know . Uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ?\nGrad F: Yep .\nGrad D: Um , I missed the beginning , but , um I guess {disfmarker} could you back to the slide , the previous one ? So , is it that it 's , um {disfmarker} These are all factors that uh , a These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ? or that we want to {vocalsound} take into account ? You were saying n\nProfessor C: Take them into account . But {disfmarker} but you don't worry about {disfmarker} h\nGrad D: Take the {disfmarker} the linguistic factors too . Oh , how to extract these features .\nProfessor C: how to extract them . So , f let 's find out which ones we need first ,\nGrad D: OK . Got it .\nProfessor C: and {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK . And {disfmarker} and it 's clear from the data , um , like , sorta the correct answer in each case .\nProfessor C: No .\nGrad D: But l\nGrad B: No . But {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the slide of data .\nGrad D: That 's {disfmarker} that 's the thing I 'm curious ab\nGrad B: Um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Like do we know from the data wh which {disfmarker} OK . So {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Not from that data . But , um , since we are designing a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , {comment} um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: in some shape , way , form over the other ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Um , from this , we can sometimes , you know {disfmarker} an and that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} but that {disfmarker} isn't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ? is sort of {disfmarker} s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Right .\nGrad B: you know ?\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net . So , um , this is exactly what {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Because y you can never be sure . And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , \" Well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . \"\nGrad D: Sure .\nGrad B: You know , because then , uh , you {disfmarker}\nGrad D: u u I mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task . Right ? Where you have {disfmarker} where your , uh , current goal is to {disfmarker}\nGrad B: We Yeah ! That 's what we 're doing .\nGrad D: \nGrad B: But {disfmarker} but we will still get the phrasing all over the place .\nGrad D: So that 's what you want ? OK . So you will know .\nGrad B: I 'm sure that , you know {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . The {disfmarker} No , that 's fine . I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: From that task , yeah . So , uh , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room\nGrad D: \nProfessor C: and start recording subjects probably within a month or something . So , this is not any {disfmarker} lo any of you guys ' worry , except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need . So our job {vocalsound} is to figure out how to solve these problems . If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that . And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects . So , yeah {disfmarker} y you 're absolutely right , though . No , you {disfmarker} you will not have , and there it is , and , uh {disfmarker} But you know , y y the , um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: And I think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} I don't know if this was collected {disfmarker} what situation this data was collected in . Was it {disfmarker} is it the one that you showed in your talk ? Like people {disfmarker}\nGrad B: No , no . No .\nGrad D: But OK . So was this , like , someone actually mobile , like {disfmarker} s using a device ?\nGrad B: Uh , N no , no not {disfmarker} i it was mobile but not {disfmarker} not with a w a real wizard system . So there were never answers .\nGrad D: Uh - huh . OK . OK . But , is it {disfmarker} I guess I don't know {disfmarker} The situation of {disfmarker} of collecting th the data of , like {disfmarker} Here you could imagine them being {disfmarker} walking around the city . as like one situation . And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: If they 're doing it in a {disfmarker} you know , \" I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions \" , I {disfmarker} I would imagine that the data would be really different . Um , so it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah . But {disfmarker} It was never th th the goal of that data collection to {disfmarker} to serve for sat for such a purpose . So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: there was n there was no label ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: you know , intention A , intention B , intention C .\nGrad D: Right .\nGrad B: Or task A , B , C . Um I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it , um , that {disfmarker} that will help us along those lines .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: But , you know , you gotta leave something for other people to model . So , to {disfmarker} Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: what suffices and what doesn't . And then we can start worrying about where to get this input , what {disfmarker} what do we need , you know {disfmarker} Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Hmm .\nGrad B: It 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment .\nGrad E: How exactly does the data collection work ? Do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ?\nGrad B: OK . Imagine you 're the {disfmarker} the subject . You 're gonna be in here , and somebody {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and you see , uh , either th the three - D model , or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg . So you actually see that . Um . The uh , um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg . So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth . So that 's part one . Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , and it understands you completely . And so you 're gonna pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve . First you have to know {disfmarker} find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . Maybe {disfmarker} So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . The third one is to get information on the history of an object . The fourth one {disfmarker} And then the g system breaks down . It crashes , And {disfmarker}\nGrad D: a At the third ? Right then ?\nGrad B: After the third task .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad B: And then {disfmarker} Or after the fourth . Some find {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Forget that for now . And then , a human operator comes on , and {disfmarker} and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . And so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . Oh , and one {disfmarker} one little bit {disfmarker} w And uh , the computer you are {disfmarker} you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS . When the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know . So the GPS is crashed as well . So the person first has to ask you \" Where are you ? \" . And so you have to do some {disfmarker} s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . Um , this is a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a bit that I d I don't think we {disfmarker} Did we discuss that bit ? Uh , I just sort of squeezed that in now . But it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know . So .\nGrad D: So , in the display you can {disfmarker} Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah . a Additionally , y you have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a sort of a map type display .\nGrad D: a w your perspective ? sort of ?\nGrad B: Uh , two - D .\nGrad D: And so , as you {disfmarker}\nGrad B: n\nGrad D: Oh , two - D . OK .\nGrad B: Two - D .\nGrad D: So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the {disfmarker} for themselves\nGrad B: Yeah . b y You don't {disfmarker} That 's {disfmarker}\nGrad D: there .\nGrad B: I don't know . I but y I don't think you really move , sort of .\nGrad D: OK . So\nGrad B: Yeah ? I mean that would be an {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} an enormous technical effort , unless we would {disfmarker} We can show it walks to , you know . We can have movies of walking , you walking through {disfmarker} through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Maybe we wanna do that . Yeah .\nGrad D: Uh , I was just trying to figure out how {disfmarker} how ambitious the system is .\nGrad B: The map was sort of intended to {disfmarker} You want to go to that place . You know , and it 's sort of there .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: And you see the label of the name {disfmarker} So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . So your tasks don't require you to {disfmarker} I mean , uh {disfmarker} yo you 're told {disfmarker} So when your task is , I don't know , \" Go buy stamps \" or something like that ? So , do you have to respond ? or does your {disfmarker} Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w what you 're doing now ? or {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Well , we 'll see what people do .\nGrad D: There 's no {disfmarker} OK , so it 's just like , \" Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances \" .\nGrad B: Yeah , and {disfmarker} and we will record both sides . I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nGrad B: I mean , in both cases it 's gonna be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case .\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nGrad B: And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? So , you first have to do this , and that ,\nGrad D: Yep .\nGrad B: and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: see wh what they say . We can ins instruct the , uh , wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be . But um , maybe the {disfmarker} maybe what you 're suggesting {disfmarker} Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? You wanna m have it more {disfmarker} more steps , sort of ?\nGrad D: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction {disfmarker} I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Oh yeah , but {disfmarker} to some extent this is a different discussion .\nGrad D: Right ? So {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK ? So . Uh , we {disfmarker} we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff\nGrad D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard . Uh , she 's gonna get in touch with me . It 's a student of Eve 's . FEY , Fey ? Spelled FEY . Do you {disfmarker} do you {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Oh , Fey Parrill .\nProfessor C: You know her ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: OK . Sh - Is sh\nGrad D: She started taking the class last year and then didn't {disfmarker} um , you know , didn't continue . I g She 's a g\nProfessor C: She 's graduated .\nGrad D: Is she an undergradua She is a graduate , OK .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad D: Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that .\nProfessor C: OK . So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school . And she 'll be in touch . So we may have someone , uh , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in {disfmarker} in all this stuff . And is a linguist st and , so So . {vocalsound} That 's {disfmarker} So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mmm .\nProfessor C: So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing .\nGrad D: OK . I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , but with intention {vocalsound} um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors and {disfmarker} I 'm not really sure , um , how {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that {disfmarker} Um , it 's ju it 's just hard . So , I mean , obviously it 's a {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , uh , actually I guess that was my question . Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ? Like , do the {disfmarker}\nGrad D: It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah , I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was .\nGrad D: to {disfmarker} to give {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: n No one is , at the moment .\nGrad D: Right . Right .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .\nGrad D: Right .\nProfessor C: But , uh ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: the {disfmarker} The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention , and set the context , and know what language was used . So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data . Um . The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .\nGrad D: w What are the t three intentions ? Is it to go there , to see it , and {disfmarker}\nGrad B: To come as close as possible to it .\nProfessor C: Th - the terminology we 're using is to {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Yeah , it 's @ @ .\nProfessor C: Go back . To v\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: to View it . OK ? To Enter it . Now those {disfmarker} It seems to me those are cl you c you have no trouble with those being distinct . \" Take a picture of it \" you {disfmarker} you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And , for an object that 's at all big , uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh , could be quite different than either of those .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Just sort of {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK , so now I understand the referent of Tango mode . I didn't get that before .\nGrad E: See , I would have thought it was more of a waltz .\nGrad B: S To \" Waltz \" it ?\nGrad D: Yeah , like , how close are you gonna be ?\nProfessor C: Well .\nGrad D: Like , {vocalsound} Tango 's really close .\nGrad E: Yeah , cuz a tango {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , anyway . So {disfmarker}\nGrad F: All these So , like , the question is how what features can {disfmarker} like , do you wanna try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ?\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad F: Like , the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh , stem , or {disfmarker} certain construction or whatever .\nProfessor C: Right . Is there a construction , or the kind of object , or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the {disfmarker} in the s the discourse itself or in the context . So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature . Now , how you determine that is another issue . But fo for the current problem , it would just be , \" OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , \" or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , \" pppt ! \" Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .\nGrad F: Right . So , how should {disfmarker} What 's the uh , plan ? Like , how should we go about figuring out these {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK . So , first of all is , uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? JavaBayes or something ?\nGrad F: Oh . No , not really .\nProfessor C: OK . Well , anyway . f Get one . OK ? So {disfmarker} y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package , doesn't matter which one , uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . d w These are not gonna get big in {disfmarker} in the foreseeable future . But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . Because i that 's {disfmarker} A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , um , playing with this . And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files . So that if {disfmarker} if we have all these cases {disfmarker} OK ? So we make up cases that have these features , OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , \" OK , here 's a bunch of cases \" {disfmarker} There 're even ones tha that you can do learning OK ? So you have all their cases and {disfmarker} and their results and you have a {disfmarker} algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the {disfmarker} the probabilities for you . Um , probably that 's not worth it . I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the {disfmarker} these data fitting ones worth it , but I don't know . So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package . OK , and you wanna it s You know , the standard things you want it stable , you want it {disfmarker} yeah , @ @ . And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on .\nGrad B: An - Nuh .\nProfessor C: But it {disfmarker} what I like about it is it 's very concrete . OK ? We {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} we know what the outcomes are gonna be , and we have some {disfmarker} some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition , and see how hard it is , and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . So it {disfmarker} if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to {disfmarker} You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: And it {disfmarker} and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis . I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , that are contained in the data , um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them . And {disfmarker} and that altogether could also be {disfmarker} uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it . And um {disfmarker} When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language Java ?\nProfessor C: No , th It turns out that there is a , uh {disfmarker} The new end of Java libraries . OK , and it turns out one called\nGrad B: Mmm . OK .\nProfessor C: Which is one that fair {disfmarker} people around here use a fair amount . I have no idea whether that 's {disfmarker}  The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So that i that 's I think why a lot of people doing research use that . But it may not be {disfmarker} I have no idea whether that 's the best choice an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets . So , uh ,\nGrad D: There 's the m tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed ,\nProfessor C: Right . It 's OK .\nGrad D: which might be useful too .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with .\nGrad D: And it 's available Matlab code .\nProfessor C: Nancy knows him well . I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: but , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah , I know him .\nGrad B: But i But since we all probably are pretty sure that , um , the {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: For example , this th th the dialogue history is {disfmarker} is um , producing XML documents . M - three - L of course is XML . And the ontology that um , uh the student is {disfmarker} is constructing for me back in {disfmarker} in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML . And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nGrad B: Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able {disfmarker} We can couple .\nProfessor C: Yeah . So , yeah , we 're sort of {nonvocalsound} committed to XML as the kind of , uh , interchange . But that 's , you know , not a big deal .\nGrad B: Who isn't , nuh ?\nProfessor C: So , in terms of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} interchanging in and out of any module we build , It 'll be XML . And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's fine an and um , all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind . So they {disfmarker} they have worked very hard . It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth . So , that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet . I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML , um , little descriptors . I believe .\nGrad B: Hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I like , for example , the {disfmarker} what you said about the getting input from {disfmarker} from just files about where you h where you have the data , have specified the features and so forth .\nProfessor C: I don't {disfmarker} I don't see {disfmarker}\nGrad B: That 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , XML .\nProfessor C: Uh , you could have an X {disfmarker} yeah , you could make and XML format for that . Sure .\nGrad B: So r\nProfessor C: That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} um , you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any . So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that um , do things you 'd like .\nGrad F: Doesn't {disfmarker} does SmartKom system have such packages ?\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Sure .\nGrad B: The {disfmarker} the lib M - three - L library does that . It 's also {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: And the question is , d you c you {disfmarker} you 'll have to l We 'll have to l That should be {disfmarker} ay We should be able to look at that {disfmarker}\nGrad B: No , u u y um the {disfmarker} What I {disfmarker} What sort of came to my mind i is {disfmarker} was the notion of an idea that if {disfmarker} if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um , probability factors based on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on input {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: which is in file format , if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some {disfmarker} some corpora that other people made and , for example , if {disfmarker} if they are in {disfmarker} in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: Um , Michael has a project where {disfmarker} you know , recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE , and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data . So if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not {disfmarker} not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of {disfmarker} of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: It 'd be nice , but {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do I don't wanna count on it . I mean , you can't {disfmarker} you can't run your project based on the speculation that {disfmarker} that the data will come ,\nGrad B: No , no , uh , just for {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: and you don't have to actually design the nets .\nGrad B: Nuh . Just a back door that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think we should devote m\nProfessor C: Could happen . Yeah . So in terms of {disfmarker} of the , um {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . You don't {disfmarker} You know , you don't really like it . So we 're not {disfmarker} we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages . We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format , but hey .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor C: Um , it 's , uh {disfmarker} It doesn't control what you do in you know , internally .\nGrad B: \nGrad E: What 's the time frame for this ?\nGrad B: Two days ? Two , three days ?\nProfessor C: Huh ? Yeah bu w I 'd like that this {disfmarker} y yeah , this week , to ha to n to {vocalsound} have y guys , uh , you know , pick {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} y you know , belief - net package\nGrad B: No .\nProfessor C: and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something .\nGrad F: Sure .\nProfessor C: And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem . Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on , and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way . I mean , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site or {disfmarker} You know , how\nGrad B: Uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} um , OK , I {disfmarker} t Yeah . I was actually more joking . With the two or three days . So this was {disfmarker} was a usual jo\nProfessor C: OK , I wasn't .\nGrad B: Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Right .\nGrad B: But um , maybe it might be interesting if {disfmarker} if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked , and what it does , and how it does that .\nProfessor C: Well , y Well , or both of them speak .\nGrad F: Sure .\nGrad B: Yeah , or you can split it up .\nProfessor C: We don't care .\nGrad B: So , y\nGrad F: Hmm .\nGrad B: So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} for slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and {disfmarker} and how far you 've gotten . Pppt !\nProfessor C: Well , I 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . Even if it 's really crude . OK ? So , you know , here a here are {disfmarker}\nGrad E: So we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot ,\nProfessor C: Right . Yeah .\nGrad E: and {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is , I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , \" Here 's the package , here 's the current one we have , \" uh , you know , \" What other ideas do you have ? \" and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file . Of , uh , you know , get a {disfmarker} t a p tentative format for it , let 's say XML , that says , l you know , \" These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . \" We can just add to that and there 'll be this {disfmarker} this file of them and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this , um {disfmarker} this data file .\nGrad F: So we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities .\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah , unt until we know more .\nGrad F: OK .\nGrad E: And what 's the relation to this with {disfmarker} Changing the table so that the system works in English ?\nGrad B: OK . So this is {disfmarker} Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails . The {disfmarker} the full NT and the full Linux version are there . I 've downloaded them both , and I started to unpack the Linux one {disfmarker} Uh , the NT one worked fine . and I started unta pack the Linux one , it told me that I can't really unpack it because it contains a future date . So this is the time difference between Germany . I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it . Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we {disfmarker} I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .\nGrad E: I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker} You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad B: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,\nGrad F: Mmm .\nGrad B: which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .\nGrad D: Oh , really ?\nGrad B: So . Um {disfmarker} So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} because car navigation systems don't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number .\nGrad D: Hmm .\nGrad B: But even that is problematic .\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad B: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ?\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .\nGrad D: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .\nGrad B: Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Clear ?\nGrad F: OK . Sounds good .\nGrad E: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .\nGrad D: I was wondering .\nGrad B: Do you wanna see a picture ?\nGrad D: OK . Sure !\nGrad E: Sure !\nGrad B: Have to reboot for that though .\nGrad D: Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?\nProfessor C: Of course they use the sample data .\nGrad D: Is it like {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker} Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?\nGrad B: There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality\nGrad D: Right . Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nGrad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . \"\nGrad D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .\nGrad B: Talk features . Yep .\nProfessor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .\nGrad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .\nProfessor C: Uh , is that OK ?\nGrad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .\nProfessor C: Alright . Oh . Ni\nGrad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .\nGrad B: Ahh .\nGrad E: OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .\nGrad D: That 's right , OK .\nGrad B: Mmm .", "answers": ["C began by asking some questions about the recording procedure and wanted to know what excising utterances from the transcript would look like.

OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ?\nPhD A: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: That are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: um .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it .\nProfessor D: Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK .\nPhD B: Ah , yeah .\nProfessor D: Ah .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah .\nPhD B: Uh , do you want @ @ .\nProfessor D: This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: Let 's see . Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal . The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . Um , yeah . Mmm . You know you can {disfmarker} you can comment these results ,\nPhD B: Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , um , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta , uh we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when\nPhD A: Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy .\nPhD B: w Yeah , this {disfmarker} Yeah , this number recognition acc\nPhD A: So it 's not the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Again we switch to another {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yes , and the baseline {disfmarker} the baseline have {disfmarker} i is eighty - two .\nProfessor D: Baseline is eighty - two .\nPhD B: Yeah\nPhD A: So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this .\nProfessor D: Uh , this is Italian mismatched .\nPhD A: Um .\nPhD B: Yeah , by the moment .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD B: And first in the experiment - one I {disfmarker} I do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I use different MLP ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . Um . for the ne {disfmarker} rest of experiment I use multi - English , only multi - English . And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy .\nPhD A: Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: but this is not the case for Italian what {disfmarker} where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So , um {vocalsound} uh , well , I don't think this is a bug but this {disfmarker} this is something in {disfmarker} probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But {disfmarker} that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP .\nProfessor D: I Um , the uh , baseline system {disfmarker} when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: and the training is Italian digits ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and {disfmarker} and , uh microphone and so forth ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: right ? So , um did we have {disfmarker} So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is {disfmarker} is the uh Italian digits ?\nPhD B: The train the training of the HTK ?\nProfessor D: The {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yes . Ah yes !\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD B: This h Yes . Th - Yes .\nProfessor D: Yes . Training of the net ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: yeah . So , um {disfmarker} So what that says is that in a matched condition , {vocalsound} we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . Now w would {disfmarker} do we have a number , I suppose for the matched {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't mean matched , but uh use of Italian {disfmarker} training in Italian digits for PLP only ?\nPhD B: Uh {pause} yes ?\nPhD A: Uh {pause} yeah , so this is {disfmarker} basically this is in the table . Uh {pause} so the number is fifty - two ,\nPhD B: Another table .\nPhD A: uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Fifty - two percent .\nPhD A: Fift - So {disfmarker} No , it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: No .\nProfessor D: No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ?\nPhD A: Of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of uh {pause} eighteen {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Eighty .\nPhD A: of eighteen .\nPhD B: Eighty .\nPhD A: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's error rate , basically .\nPhD B: It 's plus six .\nPhD A: It 's er error rate ratio . So {disfmarker} \nProfessor D: Oh this is accuracy ! \nPhD A: Uh , so we have nine {disfmarker} nine {disfmarker} let 's say ninety percent .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oy ! {comment} OK . Ninety .\nPhD A: Yeah . Um {comment} which is uh {comment} what we have also if use PLP and MSG together ,\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: eighty - nine point seven .\nProfessor D: OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition {disfmarker} Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping .\nPhD A: Uh . P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same {disfmarker} same results .\nProfessor D: Same result pretty much ?\nPhD A: Well , we have these results . I don't know . It 's not {disfmarker} Do you have this result with PLP alone , {comment} j fee feeding HTK ?\nProfessor D: So , s\nPhD A: That {disfmarker} That 's what you mean ?\nPhD B: Yeah ,\nPhD A: Just PLP at the input of HTK .\nPhD B: yeah yeah yeah yeah , at the first {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . So , PLP {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Eighty - eight point six .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um , so adding MSG\nPhD A: Um {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: um {disfmarker} Well , but that 's {disfmarker} yeah , that 's without the neural net ,\nPhD A: Yeah , that 's without the neural net\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD A: and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization .\nProfessor D: But she had said eighty - two .\nPhD A: This is the {disfmarker} w well , but this is without on - line normalization .\nProfessor D: Right ? Oh , this {disfmarker} the eighty - two .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: \nPhD A: Eighty - two is the {disfmarker} it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use {disfmarker} well , OGI , they use MFCC {disfmarker} th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization\nProfessor D: Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy .\nPhD A: Yeah , sorry . Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Alright . So this is {disfmarker} I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better\nPhD B: Yes , better .\nProfessor D: because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead .\nPhD A: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent .\nPhD B: Nnn , we don't know exactly .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} whatever the normalization , actually . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to {disfmarker} to ninety , or something .\nPhD A: Well , ninety {disfmarker} No , I {disfmarker} I mean ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight .\nProfessor D: Eighty - nine .\nPhD A: Well , there are minor {disfmarker} minor differences .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically .\nPhD A: No .\nProfessor D: Yeah . OK .\nPhD A: Uh For Italian , yeah .\nProfessor D: For this case , right ?\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: Alright . So , um {disfmarker} So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you {disfmarker} uh does not help in that case .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker}\nPhD A:  But w Yeah .\nProfessor D: The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but {disfmarker} And the multi - English , does uh {disfmarker} So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um {pause} and {pause} we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net .\nPhD A: Yeah\nProfessor D: And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things .\nPhD A: No .\nProfessor D: And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error . Uh {pause} no , not quite that , is it . Uh , two point six out of eighteen . About , um {pause} sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Not matching condition , but uh , the uh , Italian training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: We select these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these tasks because it 's the more difficult .\nProfessor D: Yes , good . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching , uh , data for the {disfmarker} uh for the new {disfmarker} for the other languages and so forth . Um , one qu thing is that , uh {disfmarker} I think I asked you this before , but I wanna double check . When you say \" ME \" in these other tests , that 's the multi - English ,\nPhD A: That 's {disfmarker} it 's a part {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of {disfmarker} part of it .\nPhD A: Or , one million frames .\nProfessor D: And the multi - English is how much ?\nPhD B: You have here the information .\nPhD A: It 's one million and a half . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: you think . So , it it 's still {disfmarker} it hurts you {disfmarker} seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I wonder why Yeah . Uh .\nGrad C: Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled ,\nPhD A: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: the French and the Spanish .\nPhD B: The Spanish . Maybe for that .\nProfessor D: Hmm .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: It 's still {disfmarker} OK . Alright , go ahead . And then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Um . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I {disfmarker} first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature {disfmarker} another feature .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And we s we can {disfmarker} first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta {disfmarker} PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Maybe if {disfmarker} when we have the new {disfmarker} the new {pause} neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . I don't know .\nPhD A: Actually , just to be some more {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the\nProfessor D: Yes , yeah , I mean it can't be compared with the other\nPhD A: Which number ?\nProfessor D: cuz this is , uh {disfmarker} with multi - English , uh , training .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that , uh the eighty - four point six .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Right ?\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: So {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: and straight features with delta - delta . And straight features with delta - delta gives you what 's on the first sheet .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Not t not\nPhD A: It 's eight eighty - eight point six .\nProfessor D: tr No . No . No .\nPhD B: Yes .\nProfessor D: Not trained with multi - English .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah , but th this is the second configuration .\nPhD B: No , but they {disfmarker} they feature @ @ without {disfmarker}\nPhD A: So we use feature out uh , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not {disfmarker} perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features .\nProfessor D: Eh . {comment} Oh , I see . Ah . So you 're saying w so asking the question , \" What {disfmarker} what has adding the MLP done to improve over the ,\nPhD A: So , just {disfmarker} Yeah so , actually it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it decreased the {disfmarker} the accuracy .\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: Because we have eighty - eight point six .\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: And even the MLP alone {disfmarker} What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . Oh no , it gives eighty - three point six . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six ,\nPhD B: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: that gives eighty - seven point one .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty {disfmarker} eighty - eight point six .\nPhD A: Eighty - three point six . Eighty {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Is th is that right ? Yeah ?\nPhD B: Yeah . But {disfmarker} I don't know {disfmarker} but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP {pause} delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help .\nPhD A: Perhaps , yeah .\nProfessor D: Well , that 's {disfmarker} that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that , um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's {disfmarker} let 's consider what that means . What {disfmarker} what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that {disfmarker} I mean my interpretation of your {disfmarker} your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And , um , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it {disfmarker} when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad .\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh {disfmarker} on say digits ,\nPhD A: On TI - digits ? OK .\nProfessor D: you know , d Was that experiment done ?\nPhD A: No , not yet .\nProfessor D: Yeah , OK . Uh , then does that , eh {disfmarker} you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , {comment} does it {disfmarker} does it then look much better ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh {disfmarker} of tests ? So , an anyway . OK , go ahead .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , uh , d I have found more or less the same result .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So , it 's slightly better ,\nPhD B: Little bit better ?\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: Slightly better .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Slightly bet better . Yes , is better .\nProfessor D: And {disfmarker} and you know again maybe if you use the , uh , delta {pause} there , uh , you would bring it up to where it was , uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case .\nPhD B: Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Maybe .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Well , so perhaps let 's {disfmarker} let 's jump at the last experiment .\nPhD B:  Oh , yeah .\nProfessor D: So .\nPhD A: It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output .\nPhD B: i\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: It 's again better . So it 's eighty - nine point {disfmarker} point one .\nPhD B: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and we have only forty {disfmarker} forty feature\nPhD A: So .\nPhD B: because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , uh , doesn't work {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD B: uh , well , work , but is better , the second configuration . Because I {disfmarker} for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one .\nProfessor D: Um , by the way , there is a another , uh , suggestion that would apply , uh , to the second configuration , um , which , uh , was made , uh , by , uh , Hari . And that was that , um , if you have {disfmarker} uh feed two streams into HTK , um , and you , uh , change the , uh variances {disfmarker} if you scale the variances associated with , uh these streams um , you can effectively scale {pause} the streams . Right ? So , um , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , which is the rule here , uh , you can still change the variances\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: which would effectively change the scale of these {disfmarker} these , uh , two streams that come in .\nPhD A: Uh , {comment} yeah .\nProfessor D: And , um , so , um , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , um , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And , um , so this is just setting them to be , excuse me , of equal {disfmarker} equal weight . Maybe it shouldn't be equal weight .\nPhD B: Maybe .\nProfessor D: Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , but {disfmarker} but , uh , um , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: It 's not even the HTK ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: uh , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Well , I guess you have to do the HTK training also .\nPhD B: so this is what we decided to do .\nProfessor D: Uh , do you ? Let me think . Maybe you don't . Uh . Yeah , you have to change the {disfmarker} No , you can just do it in {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} once you 've done the training {disfmarker}\nGrad C: And then you can vary it . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could {disfmarker} you could just scale them all .\nPhD A: Scale\nProfessor D: Variances .\nPhD A: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Is it {disfmarker} i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances , so I d Is it {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: That 's uh , exactly the point , I think , that if you change {disfmarker} um , change what they are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: It 's diagonal covariance matrices , but you say what those variances are .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So , that {disfmarker} you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna {disfmarker} it 's gonna {disfmarker} it 's gonna internally multiply it {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh , {vocalsound} uh , i it im uh implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the {disfmarker} change the variances {pause} of some of the features .\nPhD A: Mmm . Mmm .\nPhD B: do ?\nProfessor D: So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , uh , the s the strength that you apply the features . That was {disfmarker} that was , uh , Hari 's suggestion .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: So , um {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So . So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just {disfmarker} just not the right thing to do . Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms because , you know , maybe it should be a different {vocalsound} number for {disfmarker} for each {vocalsound} kind of {pause} test set , or something ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So I guess the other thing is to take {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} if one were to take , uh , you know , a couple of the most successful of these ,\nPhD A: Yeah , and test across everything .\nProfessor D: and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , try all these different tests .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Alright . Uh .\nPhD A: So , the next point , yeah , we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , um , about their um , uh , articulatory stuff , um . So we 'll perhaps start something next week .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Um , discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our {disfmarker} our networks with their {disfmarker} within their block diagram , uh , where to plug in the {disfmarker} the network , uh , after the {disfmarker} the feature , before as um a as a plugin or as a anoth another path , discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , um , actually Hynek would like to see , perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , uh , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band . And he would like to replace these by a network which would , uh , make the system look like a TRAP . Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system . Basically , this is a TRAP system {disfmarker} kind of TRAP system , I mean , but where the neural network are replaced by LDA . Hmm . {vocalsound} Um , yeah , and about multi - band , uh , I started multi - band MLP trainings , um mmh {comment} Actually , I w I w hhh {comment} prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything . And , mmm , I 'm starting to train also , networks with larger contexts . So , this would {disfmarker} would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and {disfmarker} but with a lot of context also . So Um Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages . For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything . So . Now we can test these two networks on {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with delta and large networks . Well , test them also on Finnish\nPhD B: Mmm .\nPhD A: and see which one is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the best . Uh , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what {disfmarker} everything that has been done . So . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one , two , three , four , uh , three , four , five , six , seven ten {disfmarker} on ten different databases .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , the number of frames is bad also , so we have one million and a half for some , three million for other , and six million for the last one . Uh , yeah ! {comment} As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled , and perhaps this is what makes the difference . Um . Yeah , the other are just Viterbi - aligned . So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things . First , um with respect to the on - line normalization , there are {disfmarker} that use bad on - line normalization , and other good on - line normalization . Um . With respect to the features , with respect to the use of delta or no , uh with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets . Uh , but of course we don't have all the combination of these different parameters Um . s What 's this ? We only have two hundred eighty six different tests And no not two thousand .\nProfessor D:  Ugh ! I was impressed boy , two thousand .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Ah , yes .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD B: I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , OK .\nPhD A: Um . Yeah , basically the observation is what we discussed already . The MSG problem , um , the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate . but when the M - MLP is trained on the um {disfmarker} is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features . Except if the features are bad {disfmarker} uh , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized . In this case the tandem is still better even if it 's trained on {disfmarker} not on the target digits .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So it sounds like {vocalsound} yeah , the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: But if you can do good normalization it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh , so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better {disfmarker} the best network .\nProfessor D: So So - Let me {disfmarker} bef before you go on to the possible issues .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So , on the MSG uh problem um , I think that in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} um , in the short {pause} time {pause} solution um , that is , um , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: uh , much as I said with JRASTA , even though I really like JRASTA and I really like MSG ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it {disfmarker} it may be complicated .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: And uh it might be {disfmarker} if someone 's interested in it , uh , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term , once we get out of this particular rush {pause} uh for results .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: But in the short term , unless you have some {disfmarker} some s strong idea of what 's wrong ,\nPhD A: I don't know at all but I 've {disfmarker} perhaps {disfmarker} I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite {disfmarker} quite simple or just like nnn , no high - pass filter\nProfessor D: Yeah , probably .\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} Mmm . Yeah . {pause} My {disfmarker} But I don't know .\nProfessor D: There 's supposed to {disfmarker} well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though , right ?\nPhD A: It 's {disfmarker} There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be uh , yeah ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: taking out means and variances and so forth . So .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design ,\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah . But this was the bad on - line normalization . Actually . Uh . Are your results are still with the bad {disfmarker} the bad {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Maybe , may {disfmarker} No ? With the better {disfmarker}\nPhD A: With the O - OLN - two ?\nPhD B: No ?\nPhD A: Ah yeah , you have {disfmarker} you have OLN - two ,\nPhD B: Oh ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! With \" two \" , with \" on - line - two \" .\nPhD A: yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah ,\nProfessor D: \" On - line - two \" is good .\nPhD A: So it 's , is the good yeah .\nPhD B: yeah . Yep , it 's a good .\nProfessor D: \" Two \" is good ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: No , \" two \" is bad .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Well , actually , it 's good with the ch with the good .\nProfessor D: OK . Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah , I {disfmarker} I agree . It 's probably something simple uh , i if {disfmarker} if uh someone , you know , uh , wants to play with it for a little bit . I mean , you 're gonna do what you 're gonna do\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker} but my {disfmarker} my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mmm . I see , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh . {comment} And the other {disfmarker} the results uh , observations two and three , Um , is\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's pretty much what we 've seen . That 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task {disfmarker} If it 's on the target task then it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it helps to have the MLP transforming it .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: If it uh {disfmarker} if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is , uh you can get uh , a reduction in performance .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And the question is now how to {disfmarker} how to get one and not the other ? Or how to {disfmarker} how to ameliorate the {disfmarker} the problems .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Um , because it {disfmarker} it certainly does {disfmarker} is nice to have in there , when it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} when there is something like the training data .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . Um . Yeah . So , {pause} the {disfmarker} the reason {disfmarker} Yeah , the reason is that the {disfmarker} perhaps the target {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the task dependency {disfmarker} the language dependency , {vocalsound} and the noise dependency {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So that 's what you say th there . I see .\nPhD A: Well , the e e But this is still not clear because , um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think we have enough result to talk about the {disfmarker} the language dependency . Well , the TIMIT network is still the best but there is also an the other difference , the fact that it 's {disfmarker} it 's hand - labeled .\nProfessor D: Hey ! Um , just {disfmarker} you can just sit here . Uh , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones but it 's uh {disfmarker} Just uh , have a seat . Um . s Summary of the first uh , uh forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and {disfmarker} works , and some stuff doesn't OK ,\nPhD A: We still have uh {pause} this {disfmarker} One of these perhaps ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think if you {disfmarker} if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words and then th that has it the {pause} associated results .\nPhD B: Um .\nProfessor D: OK . So you 're saying that um , um , although from what we see , yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , uh , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing . But you 're saying that uh , it is {disfmarker} Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about . And {disfmarker} and what is that ? I mean , you say \" not clear yet \" . What {disfmarker} what do you mean ?\nPhD A: Uh , mmm , uh , {comment} I mean , that the {disfmarker} the fact that s Well , for {disfmarker} for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best ,  which is the English net .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: But the other are slightly worse . But you have two {disfmarker} two effects , the effect of changing language and the effect of training on something that 's {pause} Viterbi - aligned instead of hand {disfmarker} hand - labeled .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: So . Um . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Do you think the alignments are bad ? I mean , have you looked at the alignments at all ? What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ?\nPhD A: Mmm . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know . Did - did you look at the Spanish alignments Carmen ?\nPhD B: Mmm , no .\nProfessor D: Might be interesting to look at it . Because , I mean , that is just looking but um , um {disfmarker} It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment . It depends how good the recognizer is\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the engine is that 's doing the alignment .\nPhD A: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . But , perhaps it 's not really the {disfmarker} the alignment that 's bad but the {disfmarker} just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment\nProfessor D: Aha !\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah . \nProfessor D: The pronunciation models and so forth\nPhD A: I mean {pause} for {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} It 's single pronunciation , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Aha .\nPhD A: French {disfmarker} French s uh , phoneme strings were corrected manually\nProfessor D: I see .\nPhD A: so we asked people to listen to the um {disfmarker} the sentence and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them . But still ,  there {disfmarker} there might be errors just in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the ph string of phonemes . Mmm . Um . Yeah , so this is not really the Viterbi alignment ,  in fact , yeah . Um , the third {disfmarker} The third uh issue is the noise dependency perhaps but , well , this is not clear yet because all our nets are trained on the same noises and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . So it {disfmarker} And that has other noise .\nPhD A: Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . Results are only coming for {disfmarker} for this net . Mmm .\nProfessor D: OK , yeah , just don't {disfmarker} just need more {disfmarker} more results there with that @ @ .\nPhD A: Yeah . Um . So . Uh , from these results we have some questions with answers . What should be the network input ? Um , PLP work as well as MFCC , I mean . Um . But it seems impor important to use the delta . Uh , with respect to the network size , there 's one experiment that 's still running and we should have the result today , comparing network with five hundred and {pause} one thousand units . So , nnn , still no answer actually .\nProfessor D: Hm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , the training set , well , some kind of answer . We can , we can tell which training set gives the best result , but {vocalsound} we don't know exactly why . Uh , so .\nProfessor D: Uh . Right , I mean the multi - English so far is {disfmarker} is the best .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: \" Multi - multi - English \" just means \" TIMIT \" ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So uh That 's {disfmarker} Yeah . So . And {disfmarker} and when you add other things in to {disfmarker} to broaden it , it gets worse {pause} uh typically .\nPhD A: Mmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Then uh some questions without answers .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Uh , training set , um ,\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: uh , training targets {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I like that . The training set is both questions , with answers and without answers .\nPhD A: It 's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: It 's sort of , yes {disfmarker} it 's mul it 's multi - uh - purpose .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Uh , training s Right . So {disfmarker} Yeah , the training targets actually , the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency {vocalsound} and the noise dependency . And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And labeling s labeling seems important uh , because of TIMIT results .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh . For moment you use {disfmarker} we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even , um use networks that doesn't do classification but just regression so uh , train to have neural networks that um , um , uh ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: does a regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . I mean uh , transform the fea noisy features {vocalsound} in other features that are not noisy . But continuous features . Not uh uh , hard targets .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah , that {pause} seems like a good thing to do , probably ,  not uh again a short - term sort of thing .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I mean one of the things about that is that um it 's {disfmarker} e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being {disfmarker} is being dependent on {disfmarker} very dependent on the kind of noise and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nPhD A: Yeah . f But , yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh . But it 's another thing to try .\nPhD A: So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this {disfmarker} this could be {disfmarker} could help {disfmarker} could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database . I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} So this is one {vocalsound} approach and the other is multi - band {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh , features - based targets could {disfmarker} could {disfmarker} could help .\nProfessor D: Yeah , if you {disfmarker} i i It 's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up {disfmarker} I mean w yeah , one {disfmarker} one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have {pause} um some reasonable database , um but then {disfmarker} which is um {vocalsound} copied over many times with a range of different noises ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If {disfmarker} Cuz what you 're trying to {pause} do is come up with a {disfmarker} a core , reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used uh , by the {disfmarker} the uh HMM {pause} system .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , OK .\nPhD A: So , um , yeah . The future work is , {pause} well , try to connect to the {disfmarker} to make {disfmarker} to plug in the system to the OGI system . Um , there are still open questions there , where to put the MLP basically .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: And I guess , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the real open question , I mean , e u there 's lots of open questions , but one of the core quote {comment} \" open questions \" for that is um , um , if we take the uh {disfmarker} you know , the best ones here , maybe not just the best one , but the best few or something {disfmarker} You want the most promising group from these other experiments . Um , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ?\nPhD A: Mmm ,\nProfessor D: Um . And y\nPhD A: Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor D: y {pause} Right ? And then um {disfmarker} then see , {pause} again , how {disfmarker} We know that there 's a mis there 's a uh {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than {disfmarker} than , uh we 're gonna test on , but well , if you look over a range of these different tests um , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features , uh stand up over that range ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: That 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that seems like the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the real question . And if you know that {disfmarker} So if you just take PLP with uh , the double - deltas . Assume that 's the p the feature . look at these different ways of combining it . And uh , take {disfmarker} let 's say , just take uh multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And just look {disfmarker} take that case and then look over all the different things . How does that {disfmarker} How does that compare between the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: So all the {disfmarker} all the test sets you mean , yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: All the different test sets ,\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: and for {disfmarker} and for the couple different ways that you have of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of combining them .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um . {pause} How well do they stand up , over the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mmm . And perhaps doing this for {disfmarker} cha changing the variance of the streams and so on {pause} getting different scaling {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: That 's another possibility if you have time , yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: Um . Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the {disfmarker} to their diagram .\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: Cuz {disfmarker} Yeah . Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn , they {disfmarker} they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates ,\nProfessor D: Yeah . {pause} It 's a little strange\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm ?\nProfessor D: but on the other hand they did it before .\nPhD A: Mmm . And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor D: Um the\nPhD A: yeah . And because also perhaps we know that the {disfmarker} when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help . So . I don't know .\nProfessor D: Um , the other thing , though , is that um {disfmarker} So . Uh , we {disfmarker} we wanna get their path running here , right ? If so , we can add this other stuff .\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: as an additional path right ?\nPhD A: Yeah , the {disfmarker} the way we want to do {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Cuz they 're doing LDA {pause} RASTA .\nPhD A: The d What ?\nProfessor D: They 're doing LDA RASTA ,\nPhD A: Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to {disfmarker} just to get the VAD labels and the final features .\nProfessor D: yeah ?\nPhD A: So they will send us the {disfmarker} Well , provide us with the feature files ,\nProfessor D: I see . I see .\nPhD A: and with VAD uh , binary labels so that we can uh , get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream . So .\nProfessor D: I see . So we {disfmarker} So . First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . Without putting in a second path .\nPhD A: Uh . You mean {disfmarker} Oh , yeah ! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ?\nProfessor D: Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we {pause} have {disfmarker} we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to {disfmarker} is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK .\nPhD A:  Oh yeah . Yeah , OK . Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh , I mean , I don't know that we need to r\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um {pause} Do we need to retrain I mean we can just take the re their training files also . But . {pause} But , uh just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results {pause} so we can duplicate it before we add in another {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mmm . OK .\nProfessor D: Cuz otherwise , you know , we won't know what things mean .\nPhD A: Oh , yeah . OK . And um . Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , I don't know if we want to {disfmarker} We can try {pause} networks with LogRASTA filtered features .\nProfessor D: Maybe .\nPhD A: Mmm . I 'm sorry ? Yeah . Well {disfmarker} Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . {comment} that u Um , uh , when you 're talking about combining multiple features , um {disfmarker} Suppose we said , \" OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , but PLP seems {pause} pretty good . \" If we take the approach that Mike did and have {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: I mean , one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions . We have different languages , we have different {disfmarker} {vocalsound} different noises , Um {pause} If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps {pause} with them .\nPhD A: \nProfessor D: And put {disfmarker} put them together . What {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , I mean {disfmarker} I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . That you did have nice interpolative effects . That is , that yes , if you knew {pause} what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . So it was sort of {disfmarker} behaved reasonably . Is tha that a fair {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . So you {disfmarker} you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: It works better if {pause} what ?\nPhD A: Yea\nProfessor D: I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was {disfmarker} So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh , uh , reverberation . Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f {pause} for this kind of task , I would think , {pause} sort of a modest amount . I mean , a million frames actually isn't that much . We have a modest amount of {disfmarker} of uh training data from a couple different conditions , and then uh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} yeah , that {disfmarker} and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type uh , and uh , {pause} uh , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . A bunch of different dimensions . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have {pause} um , the data to train up {disfmarker} I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in {disfmarker} we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is better . And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another {pause} we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability {pause} to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability {pause} that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm hoping that um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we {disfmarker} if they look at more constrained conditions they {disfmarker} they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD A: So doing both is {disfmarker} is not {disfmarker} is not right , you mean , or {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I just sort of have a feeling {disfmarker}\nPhD A: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i i e The um {disfmarker} I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA {pause} RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the {disfmarker} I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's {disfmarker} it uh {disfmarker} it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . So they did {disfmarker} At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? I mean they {disfmarker} they were not {disfmarker} not using the neural net . Uh I don't know . OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single {disfmarker} Yeah . Make stuff better . OK . Uh . {vocalsound} Yeah . And CPU memory issues . Yeah . We 've been sort of ignoring that , haven't we ?\nPhD A: Yeah , so I don't know .\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah , but I li Well , I think {disfmarker} My impression {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that {vocalsound} uh , there was a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a strict constraint on the delay ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better , and {vocalsound} using less CPU was better . Something like that ,\nPhD A: Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah . So , yeah , but we 've {disfmarker} I don't know . We have to get some reference point to where we {disfmarker} Well , what 's a reasonable number ? Perhaps be because if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's too large or {disfmarker} large or @ @ {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Um , well I don't think we 're {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} completely off the wall . I mean I think that if we {disfmarker} if we have {disfmarker} Uh , I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do {disfmarker} If we find uh {disfmarker} I mean we may find that we {disfmarker} we 're not really gonna worry about the M L You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , uh , we might even have more than one MLP . We could simply say that is uh , done on the uh , server .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And it 's uh {disfmarker} We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that . So , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} {pause} that 's OK .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor D: So I think the key thing was um , this plug into OGI . Um , what {disfmarker} what are they {disfmarker} What are they gonna be working {disfmarker} Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features ,\nPhD A: They 're {disfmarker} They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band .\nProfessor D: and {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: So . Um {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} that was Pratibha . Sunil , what was he doing , do you remember ?\nPhD B: Sunil ?\nPhD A: Yeah . He was doing something new or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I {disfmarker} I don't re I didn't remember . Maybe he 's working with {pause} neural network .\nPhD A: I don't think so . Trying to tune wha networks ?\nPhD B: Yeah , I think so .\nPhD A: I think they were also mainly , well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , but mainly trying to tune their {disfmarker} their system as it is now to {disfmarker} just trying to get the best from this {disfmarker} this architecture .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor D: OK . So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get {disfmarker} There 'd be some point where you say , \" OK , this is their version - one \" or whatever , and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: and then um , uh , that 's what we work with . We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then um , uh , when it gets to be uh , January some point uh , we say , \" OK we {disfmarker} we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . So now uh {pause} um {pause} what 's your newest version ? \" And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better and then we {disfmarker} we 'd combine it . This is always hard . I mean I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I used to work {pause} with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh , HMM system with uh {disfmarker} with a neural net system and uh , it was {pause} a common problem that you 'd {disfmarker} Oh , and this {disfmarker} Actually , this is true not just for neural nets but just for {disfmarker} in general if people were {pause} working with uh , rescoring uh , N - best lists or lattices that come {disfmarker} came from uh , a mainstream recognizer . Uh , You get something from the {disfmarker} the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . But they 're working really hard , too . So by the time {pause} you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: and now there isn't any difference ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: because the other {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So , um , I guess at some point we 'll have to\nPhD A: So it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker} {comment} Uh , I {disfmarker} I don't know . I think we 're {disfmarker} we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . I think at the moment they {disfmarker} they say that they have a better thing we can {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} e e\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , presumably uh , in a {disfmarker} in a day we could turn around uh , taking a new set of things from them and {disfmarker} and rescoring it ,\nPhD A: Mmm . Yeah . Yeah , perhaps we could .\nProfessor D: right ? So . Yeah . Well , OK . No , this is {disfmarker} I think this is good . I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh , you know , different trainings . You know , da training targets and noises and so forth .\nPhD A: Mmm . So we {disfmarker} we can for {disfmarker} we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps ,\nProfessor D: That 's sort of wide open .\nPhD A: or focus more on the targets and on the training data and {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: Yeah , I think for right now um , I th I {disfmarker} I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties . Um , but um , uh , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . Yeah . I think {pause} we have to start cutting down .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So uh {disfmarker} I think so , yeah . And then , you know , once we {disfmarker} Um , having gone through this {pause} process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about uh , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about MSG?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the professor think about MSG?", "context": "Professor D: OK .\nPhD A: Mike . Mike - one ?\nPhD B: Ah .\nProfessor D: We 're on ? Yes , please . I mean , we 're testing noise robustness but let 's not get silly . OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ?\nPhD A: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: That are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: um .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it .\nProfessor D: Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK .\nPhD B: Ah , yeah .\nProfessor D: Ah .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah .\nPhD B: Uh , do you want @ @ .\nProfessor D: This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: Let 's see . Yeah . Chop !\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor D: When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font !\nPhD A: Next time we will put colors or something .\nProfessor D: That 's what 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK .\nPhD A: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead .\nPhD A: It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week\nProfessor D: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . \nPhD A: well , it 's still not completely filled ,\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta .\nProfessor D: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance ,\nPhD A: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ?\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: um {disfmarker}\nGrad C: It 's out of the way .\nPhD A: But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And  Mmm , {pause} Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and training with other languages is a little bit worse .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet .\nPhD A: So ,\nProfessor D: Uh , {comment} {pause} yes .\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two ,\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: and one hundred and four when we use delta .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE\nProfessor D: Ah , yes . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal . The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . Um , yeah . Mmm . You know you can {disfmarker} you can comment these results ,\nPhD B: Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , um , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta , uh we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when\nPhD A: Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy .\nPhD B: w Yeah , this {disfmarker} Yeah , this number recognition acc\nPhD A: So it 's not the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Again we switch to another {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yes , and the baseline {disfmarker} the baseline have {disfmarker} i is eighty - two .\nProfessor D: Baseline is eighty - two .\nPhD B: Yeah\nPhD A: So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this .\nProfessor D: Uh , this is Italian mismatched .\nPhD A: Um .\nPhD B: Yeah , by the moment .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD B: And first in the experiment - one I {disfmarker} I do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I use different MLP ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . Um . for the ne {disfmarker} rest of experiment I use multi - English , only multi - English . And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy .\nPhD A: Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: but this is not the case for Italian what {disfmarker} where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So , um {vocalsound} uh , well , I don't think this is a bug but this {disfmarker} this is something in {disfmarker} probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But {disfmarker} that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP .\nProfessor D: I Um , the uh , baseline system {disfmarker} when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: and the training is Italian digits ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and {disfmarker} and , uh microphone and so forth ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: right ? So , um did we have {disfmarker} So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is {disfmarker} is the uh Italian digits ?\nPhD B: The train the training of the HTK ?\nProfessor D: The {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yes . Ah yes !\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD B: This h Yes . Th - Yes .\nProfessor D: Yes . Training of the net ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: yeah . So , um {disfmarker} So what that says is that in a matched condition , {vocalsound} we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . Now w would {disfmarker} do we have a number , I suppose for the matched {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't mean matched , but uh use of Italian {disfmarker} training in Italian digits for PLP only ?\nPhD B: Uh {pause} yes ?\nPhD A: Uh {pause} yeah , so this is {disfmarker} basically this is in the table . Uh {pause} so the number is fifty - two ,\nPhD B: Another table .\nPhD A: uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Fifty - two percent .\nPhD A: Fift - So {disfmarker} No , it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: No .\nProfessor D: No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ?\nPhD A: Of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of uh {pause} eighteen {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Eighty .\nPhD A: of eighteen .\nPhD B: Eighty .\nPhD A: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's error rate , basically .\nPhD B: It 's plus six .\nPhD A: It 's er error rate ratio . So {disfmarker} \nProfessor D: Oh this is accuracy ! \nPhD A: Uh , so we have nine {disfmarker} nine {disfmarker} let 's say ninety percent .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oy ! {comment} OK . Ninety .\nPhD A: Yeah . Um {comment} which is uh {comment} what we have also if use PLP and MSG together ,\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: eighty - nine point seven .\nProfessor D: OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition {disfmarker} Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping .\nPhD A: Uh . P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same {disfmarker} same results .\nProfessor D: Same result pretty much ?\nPhD A: Well , we have these results . I don't know . It 's not {disfmarker} Do you have this result with PLP alone , {comment} j fee feeding HTK ?\nProfessor D: So , s\nPhD A: That {disfmarker} That 's what you mean ?\nPhD B: Yeah ,\nPhD A: Just PLP at the input of HTK .\nPhD B: yeah yeah yeah yeah , at the first {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . So , PLP {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Eighty - eight point six .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um , so adding MSG\nPhD A: Um {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: um {disfmarker} Well , but that 's {disfmarker} yeah , that 's without the neural net ,\nPhD A: Yeah , that 's without the neural net\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD A: and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization .\nProfessor D: But she had said eighty - two .\nPhD A: This is the {disfmarker} w well , but this is without on - line normalization .\nProfessor D: Right ? Oh , this {disfmarker} the eighty - two .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: \nPhD A: Eighty - two is the {disfmarker} it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use {disfmarker} well , OGI , they use MFCC {disfmarker} th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization\nProfessor D: Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy .\nPhD A: Yeah , sorry . Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Alright . So this is {disfmarker} I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better\nPhD B: Yes , better .\nProfessor D: because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead .\nPhD A: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent .\nPhD B: Nnn , we don't know exactly .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} whatever the normalization , actually . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to {disfmarker} to ninety , or something .\nPhD A: Well , ninety {disfmarker} No , I {disfmarker} I mean ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight .\nProfessor D: Eighty - nine .\nPhD A: Well , there are minor {disfmarker} minor differences .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically .\nPhD A: No .\nProfessor D: Yeah . OK .\nPhD A: Uh For Italian , yeah .\nProfessor D: For this case , right ?\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: Alright . So , um {disfmarker} So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you {disfmarker} uh does not help in that case .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker}\nPhD A:  But w Yeah .\nProfessor D: The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but {disfmarker} And the multi - English , does uh {disfmarker} So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um {pause} and {pause} we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net .\nPhD A: Yeah\nProfessor D: And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things .\nPhD A: No .\nProfessor D: And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error . Uh {pause} no , not quite that , is it . Uh , two point six out of eighteen . About , um {pause} sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Not matching condition , but uh , the uh , Italian training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: We select these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these tasks because it 's the more difficult .\nProfessor D: Yes , good . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching , uh , data for the {disfmarker} uh for the new {disfmarker} for the other languages and so forth . Um , one qu thing is that , uh {disfmarker} I think I asked you this before , but I wanna double check . When you say \" ME \" in these other tests , that 's the multi - English ,\nPhD A: That 's {disfmarker} it 's a part {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of {disfmarker} part of it .\nPhD A: Or , one million frames .\nProfessor D: And the multi - English is how much ?\nPhD B: You have here the information .\nPhD A: It 's one million and a half . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: you think . So , it it 's still {disfmarker} it hurts you {disfmarker} seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I wonder why Yeah . Uh .\nGrad C: Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled ,\nPhD A: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad C: the French and the Spanish .\nPhD B: The Spanish . Maybe for that .\nProfessor D: Hmm .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: It 's still {disfmarker} OK . Alright , go ahead . And then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Um . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I {disfmarker} first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature {disfmarker} another feature .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And we s we can {disfmarker} first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta {disfmarker} PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Maybe if {disfmarker} when we have the new {disfmarker} the new {pause} neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . I don't know .\nPhD A: Actually , just to be some more {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the\nProfessor D: Yes , yeah , I mean it can't be compared with the other\nPhD A: Which number ?\nProfessor D: cuz this is , uh {disfmarker} with multi - English , uh , training .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that , uh the eighty - four point six .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Right ?\nPhD A: Uh .\nProfessor D: So {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: and straight features with delta - delta . And straight features with delta - delta gives you what 's on the first sheet .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Not t not\nPhD A: It 's eight eighty - eight point six .\nProfessor D: tr No . No . No .\nPhD B: Yes .\nProfessor D: Not trained with multi - English .\nPhD A: Uh , yeah , but th this is the second configuration .\nPhD B: No , but they {disfmarker} they feature @ @ without {disfmarker}\nPhD A: So we use feature out uh , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not {disfmarker} perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features .\nProfessor D: Eh . {comment} Oh , I see . Ah . So you 're saying w so asking the question , \" What {disfmarker} what has adding the MLP done to improve over the ,\nPhD A: So , just {disfmarker} Yeah so , actually it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it decreased the {disfmarker} the accuracy .\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yes .\nPhD A: Because we have eighty - eight point six .\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: And even the MLP alone {disfmarker} What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . Oh no , it gives eighty - three point six . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six ,\nPhD B: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: that gives eighty - seven point one .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty {disfmarker} eighty - eight point six .\nPhD A: Eighty - three point six . Eighty {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Is th is that right ? Yeah ?\nPhD B: Yeah . But {disfmarker} I don't know {disfmarker} but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP {pause} delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help .\nPhD A: Perhaps , yeah .\nProfessor D: Well , that 's {disfmarker} that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that , um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's {disfmarker} let 's consider what that means . What {disfmarker} what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that {disfmarker} I mean my interpretation of your {disfmarker} your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And , um , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it {disfmarker} when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad .\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh {disfmarker} on say digits ,\nPhD A: On TI - digits ? OK .\nProfessor D: you know , d Was that experiment done ?\nPhD A: No , not yet .\nProfessor D: Yeah , OK . Uh , then does that , eh {disfmarker} you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , {comment} does it {disfmarker} does it then look much better ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh {disfmarker} of tests ? So , an anyway . OK , go ahead .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , uh , d I have found more or less the same result .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So , it 's slightly better ,\nPhD B: Little bit better ?\nPhD A: yeah .\nProfessor D: Slightly better .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Slightly bet better . Yes , is better .\nProfessor D: And {disfmarker} and you know again maybe if you use the , uh , delta {pause} there , uh , you would bring it up to where it was , uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case .\nPhD B: Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Maybe .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh , yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . Well , so perhaps let 's {disfmarker} let 's jump at the last experiment .\nPhD B:  Oh , yeah .\nProfessor D: So .\nPhD A: It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output .\nPhD B: i\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: It 's again better . So it 's eighty - nine point {disfmarker} point one .\nPhD B: Yeah ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and we have only forty {disfmarker} forty feature\nPhD A: So .\nPhD B: because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , uh , doesn't work {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD B: uh , well , work , but is better , the second configuration . Because I {disfmarker} for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one .\nProfessor D: Um , by the way , there is a another , uh , suggestion that would apply , uh , to the second configuration , um , which , uh , was made , uh , by , uh , Hari . And that was that , um , if you have {disfmarker} uh feed two streams into HTK , um , and you , uh , change the , uh variances {disfmarker} if you scale the variances associated with , uh these streams um , you can effectively scale {pause} the streams . Right ? So , um , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , which is the rule here , uh , you can still change the variances\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: which would effectively change the scale of these {disfmarker} these , uh , two streams that come in .\nPhD A: Uh , {comment} yeah .\nProfessor D: And , um , so , um , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , um , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And , um , so this is just setting them to be , excuse me , of equal {disfmarker} equal weight . Maybe it shouldn't be equal weight .\nPhD B: Maybe .\nProfessor D: Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , but {disfmarker} but , uh , um , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: It 's not even the HTK ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: uh , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Well , I guess you have to do the HTK training also .\nPhD B: so this is what we decided to do .\nProfessor D: Uh , do you ? Let me think . Maybe you don't . Uh . Yeah , you have to change the {disfmarker} No , you can just do it in {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} once you 've done the training {disfmarker}\nGrad C: And then you can vary it . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could {disfmarker} you could just scale them all .\nPhD A: Scale\nProfessor D: Variances .\nPhD A: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Is it {disfmarker} i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances , so I d Is it {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: That 's uh , exactly the point , I think , that if you change {disfmarker} um , change what they are {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: It 's diagonal covariance matrices , but you say what those variances are .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So , that {disfmarker} you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna {disfmarker} it 's gonna {disfmarker} it 's gonna internally multiply it {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh , {vocalsound} uh , i it im uh implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the {disfmarker} change the variances {pause} of some of the features .\nPhD A: Mmm . Mmm .\nPhD B: do ?\nProfessor D: So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , uh , the s the strength that you apply the features . That was {disfmarker} that was , uh , Hari 's suggestion .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: So , um {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So . So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just {disfmarker} just not the right thing to do . Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms because , you know , maybe it should be a different {vocalsound} number for {disfmarker} for each {vocalsound} kind of {pause} test set , or something ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So I guess the other thing is to take {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} if one were to take , uh , you know , a couple of the most successful of these ,\nPhD A: Yeah , and test across everything .\nProfessor D: and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , try all these different tests .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Alright . Uh .\nPhD A: So , the next point , yeah , we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , um , about their um , uh , articulatory stuff , um . So we 'll perhaps start something next week .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Um , discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our {disfmarker} our networks with their {disfmarker} within their block diagram , uh , where to plug in the {disfmarker} the network , uh , after the {disfmarker} the feature , before as um a as a plugin or as a anoth another path , discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , um , actually Hynek would like to see , perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , uh , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band . And he would like to replace these by a network which would , uh , make the system look like a TRAP . Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system . Basically , this is a TRAP system {disfmarker} kind of TRAP system , I mean , but where the neural network are replaced by LDA . Hmm . {vocalsound} Um , yeah , and about multi - band , uh , I started multi - band MLP trainings , um mmh {comment} Actually , I w I w hhh {comment} prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything . And , mmm , I 'm starting to train also , networks with larger contexts . So , this would {disfmarker} would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and {disfmarker} but with a lot of context also . So Um Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages . For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything . So . Now we can test these two networks on {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with delta and large networks . Well , test them also on Finnish\nPhD B: Mmm .\nPhD A: and see which one is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the best . Uh , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what {disfmarker} everything that has been done . So . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one , two , three , four , uh , three , four , five , six , seven ten {disfmarker} on ten different databases .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , the number of frames is bad also , so we have one million and a half for some , three million for other , and six million for the last one . Uh , yeah ! {comment} As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled , and perhaps this is what makes the difference . Um . Yeah , the other are just Viterbi - aligned . So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things . First , um with respect to the on - line normalization , there are {disfmarker} that use bad on - line normalization , and other good on - line normalization . Um . With respect to the features , with respect to the use of delta or no , uh with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets . Uh , but of course we don't have all the combination of these different parameters Um . s What 's this ? We only have two hundred eighty six different tests And no not two thousand .\nProfessor D:  Ugh ! I was impressed boy , two thousand .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Ah , yes .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD B: I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , OK .\nPhD A: Um . Yeah , basically the observation is what we discussed already . The MSG problem , um , the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate . but when the M - MLP is trained on the um {disfmarker} is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features . Except if the features are bad {disfmarker} uh , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized . In this case the tandem is still better even if it 's trained on {disfmarker} not on the target digits .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So it sounds like {vocalsound} yeah , the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: But if you can do good normalization it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh , so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better {disfmarker} the best network .\nProfessor D: So So - Let me {disfmarker} bef before you go on to the possible issues .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So , on the MSG uh problem um , I think that in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} um , in the short {pause} time {pause} solution um , that is , um , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: uh , much as I said with JRASTA , even though I really like JRASTA and I really like MSG ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it {disfmarker} it may be complicated .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: And uh it might be {disfmarker} if someone 's interested in it , uh , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term , once we get out of this particular rush {pause} uh for results .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: But in the short term , unless you have some {disfmarker} some s strong idea of what 's wrong ,\nPhD A: I don't know at all but I 've {disfmarker} perhaps {disfmarker} I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite {disfmarker} quite simple or just like nnn , no high - pass filter\nProfessor D: Yeah , probably .\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} Mmm . Yeah . {pause} My {disfmarker} But I don't know .\nProfessor D: There 's supposed to {disfmarker} well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though , right ?\nPhD A: It 's {disfmarker} There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be uh , yeah ,\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: taking out means and variances and so forth . So .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design ,\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: so it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah . But this was the bad on - line normalization . Actually . Uh . Are your results are still with the bad {disfmarker} the bad {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Maybe , may {disfmarker} No ? With the better {disfmarker}\nPhD A: With the O - OLN - two ?\nPhD B: No ?\nPhD A: Ah yeah , you have {disfmarker} you have OLN - two ,\nPhD B: Oh ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! With \" two \" , with \" on - line - two \" .\nPhD A: yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah ,\nProfessor D: \" On - line - two \" is good .\nPhD A: So it 's , is the good yeah .\nPhD B: yeah . Yep , it 's a good .\nProfessor D: \" Two \" is good ?\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: No , \" two \" is bad .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Well , actually , it 's good with the ch with the good .\nProfessor D: OK . Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah , I {disfmarker} I agree . It 's probably something simple uh , i if {disfmarker} if uh someone , you know , uh , wants to play with it for a little bit . I mean , you 're gonna do what you 're gonna do\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker} but my {disfmarker} my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mmm . I see , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Uh . {comment} And the other {disfmarker} the results uh , observations two and three , Um , is\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's pretty much what we 've seen . That 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task {disfmarker} If it 's on the target task then it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it helps to have the MLP transforming it .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: If it uh {disfmarker} if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is , uh you can get uh , a reduction in performance .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And the question is now how to {disfmarker} how to get one and not the other ? Or how to {disfmarker} how to ameliorate the {disfmarker} the problems .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Um , because it {disfmarker} it certainly does {disfmarker} is nice to have in there , when it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} when there is something like the training data .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . Um . Yeah . So , {pause} the {disfmarker} the reason {disfmarker} Yeah , the reason is that the {disfmarker} perhaps the target {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the task dependency {disfmarker} the language dependency , {vocalsound} and the noise dependency {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So that 's what you say th there . I see .\nPhD A: Well , the e e But this is still not clear because , um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think we have enough result to talk about the {disfmarker} the language dependency . Well , the TIMIT network is still the best but there is also an the other difference , the fact that it 's {disfmarker} it 's hand - labeled .\nProfessor D: Hey ! Um , just {disfmarker} you can just sit here . Uh , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones but it 's uh {disfmarker} Just uh , have a seat . Um . s Summary of the first uh , uh forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and {disfmarker} works , and some stuff doesn't OK ,\nPhD A: We still have uh {pause} this {disfmarker} One of these perhaps ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think if you {disfmarker} if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words and then th that has it the {pause} associated results .\nPhD B: Um .\nProfessor D: OK . So you 're saying that um , um , although from what we see , yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , uh , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing . But you 're saying that uh , it is {disfmarker} Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about . And {disfmarker} and what is that ? I mean , you say \" not clear yet \" . What {disfmarker} what do you mean ?\nPhD A: Uh , mmm , uh , {comment} I mean , that the {disfmarker} the fact that s Well , for {disfmarker} for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best ,  which is the English net .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: But the other are slightly worse . But you have two {disfmarker} two effects , the effect of changing language and the effect of training on something that 's {pause} Viterbi - aligned instead of hand {disfmarker} hand - labeled .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: So . Um . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Do you think the alignments are bad ? I mean , have you looked at the alignments at all ? What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ?\nPhD A: Mmm . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know . Did - did you look at the Spanish alignments Carmen ?\nPhD B: Mmm , no .\nProfessor D: Might be interesting to look at it . Because , I mean , that is just looking but um , um {disfmarker} It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment . It depends how good the recognizer is\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the engine is that 's doing the alignment .\nPhD A: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . But , perhaps it 's not really the {disfmarker} the alignment that 's bad but the {disfmarker} just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment\nProfessor D: Aha !\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah . \nProfessor D: The pronunciation models and so forth\nPhD A: I mean {pause} for {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} It 's single pronunciation , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Aha .\nPhD A: French {disfmarker} French s uh , phoneme strings were corrected manually\nProfessor D: I see .\nPhD A: so we asked people to listen to the um {disfmarker} the sentence and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them . But still ,  there {disfmarker} there might be errors just in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the ph string of phonemes . Mmm . Um . Yeah , so this is not really the Viterbi alignment ,  in fact , yeah . Um , the third {disfmarker} The third uh issue is the noise dependency perhaps but , well , this is not clear yet because all our nets are trained on the same noises and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . So it {disfmarker} And that has other noise .\nPhD A: Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . Results are only coming for {disfmarker} for this net . Mmm .\nProfessor D: OK , yeah , just don't {disfmarker} just need more {disfmarker} more results there with that @ @ .\nPhD A: Yeah . Um . So . Uh , from these results we have some questions with answers . What should be the network input ? Um , PLP work as well as MFCC , I mean . Um . But it seems impor important to use the delta . Uh , with respect to the network size , there 's one experiment that 's still running and we should have the result today , comparing network with five hundred and {pause} one thousand units . So , nnn , still no answer actually .\nProfessor D: Hm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh , the training set , well , some kind of answer . We can , we can tell which training set gives the best result , but {vocalsound} we don't know exactly why . Uh , so .\nProfessor D: Uh . Right , I mean the multi - English so far is {disfmarker} is the best .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: \" Multi - multi - English \" just means \" TIMIT \" ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So uh That 's {disfmarker} Yeah . So . And {disfmarker} and when you add other things in to {disfmarker} to broaden it , it gets worse {pause} uh typically .\nPhD A: Mmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Then uh some questions without answers .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Uh , training set , um ,\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: uh , training targets {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I like that . The training set is both questions , with answers and without answers .\nPhD A: It 's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor D: It 's sort of , yes {disfmarker} it 's mul it 's multi - uh - purpose .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD A: Uh , training s Right . So {disfmarker} Yeah , the training targets actually , the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency {vocalsound} and the noise dependency . And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And labeling s labeling seems important uh , because of TIMIT results .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh . For moment you use {disfmarker} we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even , um use networks that doesn't do classification but just regression so uh , train to have neural networks that um , um , uh ,\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: does a regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . I mean uh , transform the fea noisy features {vocalsound} in other features that are not noisy . But continuous features . Not uh uh , hard targets .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah , that {pause} seems like a good thing to do , probably ,  not uh again a short - term sort of thing .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I mean one of the things about that is that um it 's {disfmarker} e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being {disfmarker} is being dependent on {disfmarker} very dependent on the kind of noise and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nPhD A: Yeah . f But , yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh . But it 's another thing to try .\nPhD A: So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this {disfmarker} this could be {disfmarker} could help {disfmarker} could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database . I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} So this is one {vocalsound} approach and the other is multi - band {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh , features - based targets could {disfmarker} could {disfmarker} could help .\nProfessor D: Yeah , if you {disfmarker} i i It 's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up {disfmarker} I mean w yeah , one {disfmarker} one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have {pause} um some reasonable database , um but then {disfmarker} which is um {vocalsound} copied over many times with a range of different noises ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If {disfmarker} Cuz what you 're trying to {pause} do is come up with a {disfmarker} a core , reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used uh , by the {disfmarker} the uh HMM {pause} system .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , OK .\nPhD A: So , um , yeah . The future work is , {pause} well , try to connect to the {disfmarker} to make {disfmarker} to plug in the system to the OGI system . Um , there are still open questions there , where to put the MLP basically .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: And I guess , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the real open question , I mean , e u there 's lots of open questions , but one of the core quote {comment} \" open questions \" for that is um , um , if we take the uh {disfmarker} you know , the best ones here , maybe not just the best one , but the best few or something {disfmarker} You want the most promising group from these other experiments . Um , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ?\nPhD A: Mmm ,\nProfessor D: Um . And y\nPhD A: Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor D: y {pause} Right ? And then um {disfmarker} then see , {pause} again , how {disfmarker} We know that there 's a mis there 's a uh {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than {disfmarker} than , uh we 're gonna test on , but well , if you look over a range of these different tests um , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features , uh stand up over that range ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: That 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that seems like the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the real question . And if you know that {disfmarker} So if you just take PLP with uh , the double - deltas . Assume that 's the p the feature . look at these different ways of combining it . And uh , take {disfmarker} let 's say , just take uh multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: And just look {disfmarker} take that case and then look over all the different things . How does that {disfmarker} How does that compare between the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: So all the {disfmarker} all the test sets you mean , yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: All the different test sets ,\nPhD A: And {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: and for {disfmarker} and for the couple different ways that you have of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of combining them .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um . {pause} How well do they stand up , over the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mmm . And perhaps doing this for {disfmarker} cha changing the variance of the streams and so on {pause} getting different scaling {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: That 's another possibility if you have time , yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: Um . Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the {disfmarker} to their diagram .\nProfessor D: \nPhD A: Cuz {disfmarker} Yeah . Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn , they {disfmarker} they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates ,\nProfessor D: Yeah . {pause} It 's a little strange\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm ?\nProfessor D: but on the other hand they did it before .\nPhD A: Mmm . And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor D: Um the\nPhD A: yeah . And because also perhaps we know that the {disfmarker} when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help . So . I don't know .\nProfessor D: Um , the other thing , though , is that um {disfmarker} So . Uh , we {disfmarker} we wanna get their path running here , right ? If so , we can add this other stuff .\nPhD A: Um .\nProfessor D: as an additional path right ?\nPhD A: Yeah , the {disfmarker} the way we want to do {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Cuz they 're doing LDA {pause} RASTA .\nPhD A: The d What ?\nProfessor D: They 're doing LDA RASTA ,\nPhD A: Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to {disfmarker} just to get the VAD labels and the final features .\nProfessor D: yeah ?\nPhD A: So they will send us the {disfmarker} Well , provide us with the feature files ,\nProfessor D: I see . I see .\nPhD A: and with VAD uh , binary labels so that we can uh , get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream . So .\nProfessor D: I see . So we {disfmarker} So . First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . Without putting in a second path .\nPhD A: Uh . You mean {disfmarker} Oh , yeah ! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ?\nProfessor D: Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we {pause} have {disfmarker} we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to {disfmarker} is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK .\nPhD A:  Oh yeah . Yeah , OK . Mmm .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh , I mean , I don't know that we need to r\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um {pause} Do we need to retrain I mean we can just take the re their training files also . But . {pause} But , uh just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results {pause} so we can duplicate it before we add in another {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mmm . OK .\nProfessor D: Cuz otherwise , you know , we won't know what things mean .\nPhD A: Oh , yeah . OK . And um . Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , I don't know if we want to {disfmarker} We can try {pause} networks with LogRASTA filtered features .\nProfessor D: Maybe .\nPhD A: Mmm . I 'm sorry ? Yeah . Well {disfmarker} Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . {comment} that u Um , uh , when you 're talking about combining multiple features , um {disfmarker} Suppose we said , \" OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , but PLP seems {pause} pretty good . \" If we take the approach that Mike did and have {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: I mean , one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions . We have different languages , we have different {disfmarker} {vocalsound} different noises , Um {pause} If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps {pause} with them .\nPhD A: \nProfessor D: And put {disfmarker} put them together . What {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , I mean {disfmarker} I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . That you did have nice interpolative effects . That is , that yes , if you knew {pause} what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . So it was sort of {disfmarker} behaved reasonably . Is tha that a fair {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah . So you {disfmarker} you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: It works better if {pause} what ?\nPhD A: Yea\nProfessor D: I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was {disfmarker} So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh , uh , reverberation . Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f {pause} for this kind of task , I would think , {pause} sort of a modest amount . I mean , a million frames actually isn't that much . We have a modest amount of {disfmarker} of uh training data from a couple different conditions , and then uh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} yeah , that {disfmarker} and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type uh , and uh , {pause} uh , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . A bunch of different dimensions . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have {pause} um , the data to train up {disfmarker} I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in {disfmarker} we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is better . And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another {pause} we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability {pause} to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability {pause} that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm hoping that um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we {disfmarker} if they look at more constrained conditions they {disfmarker} they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD A: So doing both is {disfmarker} is not {disfmarker} is not right , you mean , or {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I just sort of have a feeling {disfmarker}\nPhD A: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm - hmm . \nProfessor D: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i i e The um {disfmarker} I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA {pause} RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the {disfmarker} I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's {disfmarker} it uh {disfmarker} it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . So they did {disfmarker} At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? I mean they {disfmarker} they were not {disfmarker} not using the neural net . Uh I don't know . OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single {disfmarker} Yeah . Make stuff better . OK . Uh . {vocalsound} Yeah . And CPU memory issues . Yeah . We 've been sort of ignoring that , haven't we ?\nPhD A: Yeah , so I don't know .\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah , but I li Well , I think {disfmarker} My impression {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that {vocalsound} uh , there was a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a strict constraint on the delay ,\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better , and {vocalsound} using less CPU was better . Something like that ,\nPhD A: Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: right ?\nPhD A: Yeah . So , yeah , but we 've {disfmarker} I don't know . We have to get some reference point to where we {disfmarker} Well , what 's a reasonable number ? Perhaps be because if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's too large or {disfmarker} large or @ @ {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Um , well I don't think we 're {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} completely off the wall . I mean I think that if we {disfmarker} if we have {disfmarker} Uh , I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do {disfmarker} If we find uh {disfmarker} I mean we may find that we {disfmarker} we 're not really gonna worry about the M L You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , uh , we might even have more than one MLP . We could simply say that is uh , done on the uh , server .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And it 's uh {disfmarker} We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that . So , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} {pause} that 's OK .\nPhD A: And {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor D: So I think the key thing was um , this plug into OGI . Um , what {disfmarker} what are they {disfmarker} What are they gonna be working {disfmarker} Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features ,\nPhD A: They 're {disfmarker} They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band .\nProfessor D: and {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: So . Um {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} that was Pratibha . Sunil , what was he doing , do you remember ?\nPhD B: Sunil ?\nPhD A: Yeah . He was doing something new or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I {disfmarker} I don't re I didn't remember . Maybe he 's working with {pause} neural network .\nPhD A: I don't think so . Trying to tune wha networks ?\nPhD B: Yeah , I think so .\nPhD A: I think they were also mainly , well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , but mainly trying to tune their {disfmarker} their system as it is now to {disfmarker} just trying to get the best from this {disfmarker} this architecture .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD A: \nProfessor D: OK . So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get {disfmarker} There 'd be some point where you say , \" OK , this is their version - one \" or whatever , and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: and then um , uh , that 's what we work with . We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then um , uh , when it gets to be uh , January some point uh , we say , \" OK we {disfmarker} we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . So now uh {pause} um {pause} what 's your newest version ? \" And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better and then we {disfmarker} we 'd combine it . This is always hard . I mean I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I used to work {pause} with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh , HMM system with uh {disfmarker} with a neural net system and uh , it was {pause} a common problem that you 'd {disfmarker} Oh , and this {disfmarker} Actually , this is true not just for neural nets but just for {disfmarker} in general if people were {pause} working with uh , rescoring uh , N - best lists or lattices that come {disfmarker} came from uh , a mainstream recognizer . Uh , You get something from the {disfmarker} the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . But they 're working really hard , too . So by the time {pause} you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: and now there isn't any difference ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: because the other {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So , um , I guess at some point we 'll have to\nPhD A: So it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: uh {disfmarker} {comment} Uh , I {disfmarker} I don't know . I think we 're {disfmarker} we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . I think at the moment they {disfmarker} they say that they have a better thing we can {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} e e\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , presumably uh , in a {disfmarker} in a day we could turn around uh , taking a new set of things from them and {disfmarker} and rescoring it ,\nPhD A: Mmm . Yeah . Yeah , perhaps we could .\nProfessor D: right ? So . Yeah . Well , OK . No , this is {disfmarker} I think this is good . I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh , you know , different trainings . You know , da training targets and noises and so forth .\nPhD A: Mmm . So we {disfmarker} we can for {disfmarker} we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps ,\nProfessor D: That 's sort of wide open .\nPhD A: or focus more on the targets and on the training data and {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: Yeah , I think for right now um , I th I {disfmarker} I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties . Um , but um , uh , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . Yeah . I think {pause} we have to start cutting down .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So uh {disfmarker} I think so , yeah . And then , you know , once we {disfmarker} Um , having gone through this {pause} process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about uh , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . So , {comment} there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet .\nGrad C: Just listening .\nProfessor D: Well I figured that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what were you involved in in this primarily ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} helping out {vocalsound} uh , preparing {disfmarker} Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} preparing all {disfmarker} all the data for them to {disfmarker} to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .\nProfessor D: Ah !\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: I see . Right . What 's {disfmarker} what 's that ?\nGrad C: Um , {vocalsound} I 'm trying to um {disfmarker} So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this {disfmarker} this multi - band um , belief - net structure . {comment} This guy did {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad C: uh basically it was two H M Ms with {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nGrad C: And so I wanna try {disfmarker} try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that {disfmarker} that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . And um , {vocalsound} I 'm just gonna see if {disfmarker} if that {disfmarker} that better models {pause} um , uh asynchrony in any way or um {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .\nProfessor D: Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting .\nGrad C: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK . Alright . Anything to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you wanted to {disfmarker} No . OK . Silent partner in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our sound {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need {disfmarker} You happy with where we are ?\nPhD A: Mmm .\nProfessor D: Know {disfmarker} know wher know where we 're going ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD A: I think so , yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , yeah . You {disfmarker} you happy ?\nPhD B: \nProfessor D: You 're happy . OK everyone {pause} should be happy . OK . You don't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK .\nGrad E: Al - actually I should mention {disfmarker} So if {disfmarker} {comment} um , about the Linux machine \" Swede . \"\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad E: So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: And um Dan Ellis {comment} I believe knows something about using that machine so\nPhD A: Mmm .\nGrad E: If people are interested in {disfmarker} in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that .\nPhD A: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but {disfmarker} yeah , we {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least\nPhD A: Yeah , sure .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now .\nPhD A: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D: So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah .\nPhD A: Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know {disfmarker} We just select what works {pause} fine\nProfessor D: OK . OK .\nPhD A: and try to improve this\nPhD B: Yeah . to work\nProfessor D: And we 're OK on {disfmarker} And we 're OK on disk ?\nPhD A: and {disfmarker} It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems .\nPhD B: Some problems with the {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But they 're correctable , uh problems .\nPhD A: Yeah , restarting the script basically\nPhD B: You know .\nPhD A: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with {vocalsound} that one , OK . Alright , so uh , {comment} {vocalsound} since uh , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , {comment} you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We didn't uh {disfmarker} I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , {pause} pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh {disfmarker} I 'll start off the uh um connect the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: My battery is low .\nProfessor D: Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're {disfmarker} OK .\nPhD B: batteries ?\nGrad C: Yeah , your battery 's going down too .\nProfessor D: Transcript uh two {disfmarker}\nGrad C: Carmen 's battery is d going down too .\nProfessor D: Oh , OK . Yeah . Why don't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think {disfmarker} I guess we can turn off our microphones now .\nGrad C: Just pull the batteries out .", "answers": ["The professor generally liked MSG because of its different temporal properties.

{"prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nUser Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?\nMarketing: I am the um {disfmarker} I need my notebook , mm ooh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert {vocalsound} um so like I'm gonna be doing the {disfmarker} apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything {disfmarker} the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um so yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: And more about yourself , you're from ?\nMarketing: Um I'm from Leicester ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um second year . Um what else do you want to know ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I like sports {vocalsound} um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: um {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But not with rabbits . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: not with rabbits , no no .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And vets , I like vets as well .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Cool .\nMarketing: Okay ? Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Excellent , to match the rabbit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay .\nProject Manager: There's a {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . {vocalsound} Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um {vocalsound} familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have {disfmarker} shouldn't have said it beforehand but\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: mm {vocalsound} hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's not bad at all .\nProject Manager: Ah it looks like a dog .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yep .\nMarketing: Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} the other legs are on the other side .\nUser Interface: Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh I hope to be loyal to the project\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And where where are you from ?\nUser Interface: I'm from Estonia\nProject Manager: Estonia .\nUser Interface: uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: um so um in the different um {vocalsound} stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for {vocalsound} yeah , designing the technical functions of the um {vocalsound} um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay , that's it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Okay {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I'll do some {disfmarker} I'll rub the features\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and let the drawing stay . {vocalsound} 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um {vocalsound} my favourite animal {disfmarker} one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good luck .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this is going to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that'll do .\nMarketing: and then just some horns .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so let let me draw the body first .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and they've got a long tail\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and a long face . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's eating .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It looks like Eeyore . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And there is some grass there .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So this is what I like about {vocalsound} cows {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Horns ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass ,\nMarketing: draw some horns . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they do not disturb anybody um\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So yeah , I like cows . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thank you .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager: Right , now now it's my turn obviously . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , here's a space .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It looks very very cute .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I like the cow .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: I'm Jen .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I like {disfmarker} Mm .\nMarketing: Is that a lizard ?\nIndustrial Designer: No way . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Wow .\nProject Manager: It's a gecko .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah okay .\nUser Interface: Ah , a gecko , okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Is there a difference ?\nUser Interface: Is {disfmarker} a ar are they also like lizards or are they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They're {disfmarker} Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard .\nUser Interface: yeah , they are\nProject Manager: And I I like geckos\nUser Interface: {disfmarker} mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because they remind me of warm places {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ?\nProject Manager: I don't like snakes . I come from Australia\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .\nUser Interface: Wonderful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . So , I've just thought {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you right click on it you can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally {vocalsound} as {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We've got {disfmarker} um we're planning to sell these remote controls for {disfmarker} let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Marketing think of buttons when discussing the functional design of the remote control?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the Marketing think of buttons when discussing the functional design of the remote control?", "context": "User Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?\nMarketing: I am the um {disfmarker} I need my notebook , mm ooh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert {vocalsound} um so like I'm gonna be doing the {disfmarker} apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything {disfmarker} the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um so yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: And more about yourself , you're from ?\nMarketing: Um I'm from Leicester ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um second year . Um what else do you want to know ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I like sports {vocalsound} um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: um {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But not with rabbits . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: not with rabbits , no no .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And vets , I like vets as well .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Cool .\nMarketing: Okay ? Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Excellent , to match the rabbit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay .\nProject Manager: There's a {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . {vocalsound} Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um {vocalsound} familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have {disfmarker} shouldn't have said it beforehand but\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: mm {vocalsound} hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's not bad at all .\nProject Manager: Ah it looks like a dog .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yep .\nMarketing: Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} the other legs are on the other side .\nUser Interface: Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh I hope to be loyal to the project\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And where where are you from ?\nUser Interface: I'm from Estonia\nProject Manager: Estonia .\nUser Interface: uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: um so um in the different um {vocalsound} stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for {vocalsound} yeah , designing the technical functions of the um {vocalsound} um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay , that's it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Okay {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I'll do some {disfmarker} I'll rub the features\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and let the drawing stay . {vocalsound} 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um {vocalsound} my favourite animal {disfmarker} one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good luck .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this is going to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that'll do .\nMarketing: and then just some horns .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so let let me draw the body first .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and they've got a long tail\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and a long face . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's eating .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It looks like Eeyore . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And there is some grass there .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So this is what I like about {vocalsound} cows {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Horns ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass ,\nMarketing: draw some horns . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they do not disturb anybody um\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So yeah , I like cows . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thank you .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager: Right , now now it's my turn obviously . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , here's a space .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It looks very very cute .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I like the cow .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: I'm Jen .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I like {disfmarker} Mm .\nMarketing: Is that a lizard ?\nIndustrial Designer: No way . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Wow .\nProject Manager: It's a gecko .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah okay .\nUser Interface: Ah , a gecko , okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Is there a difference ?\nUser Interface: Is {disfmarker} a ar are they also like lizards or are they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They're {disfmarker} Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard .\nUser Interface: yeah , they are\nProject Manager: And I I like geckos\nUser Interface: {disfmarker} mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because they remind me of warm places {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ?\nProject Manager: I don't like snakes . I come from Australia\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .\nUser Interface: Wonderful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation .

So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ?

Radio two . Hmm . Radio two .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: Wow .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Hi ?\nPhD B: Blow into it , it works really well .\nGrad F: Channel B .\nProfessor A: People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .\nPhD D: Channel four . Test .\nPhD C: Uh - oh .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD C: Radio four .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: So everybody everybody 's on ?\nPhD D: Today 's\nProfessor A: Yeah . So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfmarker} and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that {vocalsound} you were sort of waiting for them to {vocalsound} tell you that they had something for you and {disfmarker} and that {disfmarker} and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: and {vocalsound} they were sort of waiting for you and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh we ended up with this thing where they {disfmarker} they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that . So . Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean it 's true that maybe {disfmarker} maybe no one really thought about that {disfmarker} that this latency thing would be such a {disfmarker} a strict issue\nPhD C: Yeah . Well , but . Yeah . Yeah . Well {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker} the other {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's also so uh the time constraints . Because , {vocalsound} well , we discussed about that {disfmarker} about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and\nProfessor A: Then they couldn't . I see .\nPhD C: uh yeah . But there was also problem {disfmarker} perhaps a problem of communication . So , yeah . Now we will try to {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Just talk more .\nPhD C: Yeah , slikes and send mails .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: u s o o Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh . OK .\nProfessor A: So there 's um {disfmarker} Alright . Well maybe we should just uh I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the {disfmarker} all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this {disfmarker} machines are busy and {vocalsound} you 're busy\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: and\nPhD C: Basically .\nProfessor A: Yeah . OK . Oh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Let 's {disfmarker} let 's , I mean , I think that as {disfmarker} as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there {disfmarker} there will be {vocalsound} uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that {vocalsound} it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's {vocalsound} approach or something and {vocalsound} in addition to {disfmarker} They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ?\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . So yeah we 're {disfmarker} will start to do this also .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson {disfmarker} Ericsson code .\nPhD D: Yeah . We modif\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And\nPhD D: Yeah , I modified it {disfmarker} well , modifying {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . and we have some {disfmarker} the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: But we haven't result until this moment .\nProfessor A: Yeah , sure .\nPhD D: But well , we are working in this also\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD D: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that it 's in process or that you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it finished and it didn't get a good result ?\nPhD D: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature {disfmarker} the feature but the experiment have\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD D: we have not make the experiment\nProfessor A: Oh . OK .\nPhD D: and maybe will be good result or bad result , we don't know .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK . So um I suggest actually now we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sorta move on and {disfmarker} and hear what 's {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening in {disfmarker} in other areas like {vocalsound} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening with your {vocalsound} investigations {vocalsound} about echos and so on .\nGrad F: Oh um Well um I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Uh {vocalsound} I also um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for {disfmarker} for the {disfmarker} for his code yet . Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and {vocalsound} I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it sounded like um {vocalsound} the channel normalization part {vocalsound} um of his thesis um {vocalsound} was done in a {disfmarker} a bit of I don't know what the word is , a {disfmarker} a bit of a rough way um {vocalsound} it sounded like he um he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was {vocalsound} interesting for the test situation but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it 's {vocalsound} what I 'd wanna use so I have to {disfmarker} I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet .\nProfessor A: OK . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again ,\nPhD D: It 's my\nPhD C: Oh yeah ?\nPhD D: I know this is mine here .\nProfessor A: so . OK . Um . {vocalsound} The um {disfmarker} so you , and then {vocalsound} you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the {disfmarker} the close mounted and the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts between the distant {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Uh I I 'm ho Right . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or I 'm hoping {disfmarker} I 'm hoping Espen will do it .\nProfessor A: Ah ! OK .\nGrad F: Um\nProfessor A: F um\nGrad F: u\nProfessor A: Delegate . That 's good . It 's good to delegate .\nGrad F: I {disfmarker} I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it .\nProfessor A: Great . Great . Yeah actually um he should uh I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . Um . {vocalsound} One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner {vocalsound} close - miked recordings . So uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close {disfmarker} close - miked uh cases um we 'd like to be able to have {vocalsound} um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from {disfmarker} So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be {disfmarker} So {vocalsound} what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but {vocalsound} uh just um uh taking the input from other mikes and using uh {vocalsound} uh a uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . So . Um what was it , there was {disfmarker} there was some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some point where {vocalsound} eh uh Eric or somebody was {disfmarker} was speaking and he had lots of {vocalsound} silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh {vocalsound} which was in the background and it was not {disfmarker} it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech {vocalsound} on the close {disfmarker} {vocalsound} close mike .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD B: Oh the {disfmarker} What we talked about yesterday ?\nProfessor A: Yes .\nPhD B: Yeah that was actually my {disfmarker} I was wearing the {disfmarker} I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,\nProfessor A: Oh you {disfmarker} it was you I was Yeah .\nPhD B: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that {disfmarker} mmm uh {disfmarker} that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out . So I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that . So . OK . Right ? Um . {vocalsound} And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the {disfmarker} the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but {vocalsound} maybe just a quick reprise of {disfmarker} of what we were saying this morning .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor A: Uh .\nGrad E: Um . {comment} So continuing to um extend\nPhD B: What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? And {disfmarker} and S Shawn , yeah . Oh . So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? I see .\nProfessor A: But that 's uh uh all {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} is a {disfmarker} a certainly relevant {comment} {vocalsound} uh study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . We have this problem with the overloading of the term \" feature \" so\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: uh {vocalsound} what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found {disfmarker} finding useful\nPhD C: Hmm .\nProfessor A: um for {disfmarker}\nPhD B: And their {disfmarker} their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features .\nProfessor A: Right . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nGrad E: Oh yeah .\nProfessor A: There 's those {vocalsound} {pause} that uh yeah , some of {disfmarker} some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on {disfmarker} on uh {vocalsound} what \" good features \" are and {disfmarker}\nPhD B: What does {disfmarker} what did um Larry Saul use for {disfmarker} it was the sonorant uh detector , right ? How did he {disfmarker} H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . So how did he combine all these features ? What {disfmarker} what r mmm classifier did he Hmm . Oh right . You were talking about that , yeah . I see .\nProfessor A: And the other thing you were talking about is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is where we get the targets from . So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the {disfmarker} what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels {vocalsound} from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this {disfmarker} this database ? This is the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Hmm !\nProfessor A: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah .\nPhD B: Pierced tongues and Yeah . You could just mount it to that and they wouldn't even notice . Weld it . Zzz .\nProfessor A: Maybe you could go to these parlors and {disfmarker} and you could , you know {disfmarker} you know have {disfmarker} have , you know , reduced rates if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you can do the measurements .\nPhD B: Yeah . I That 's right . You could {disfmarker} what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah , be cool and help science .\nPhD B: and Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD B: Hmm ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that {disfmarker} people have done studies like that w way way back right ? I mean {vocalsound} I can't remember where {disfmarker} uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of {disfmarker} Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ? Um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . I can't remember what his name was . Dang . Now I 'll think of it . That 's interesting .\nProfessor A: Do you mean eh {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} Mar\nPhD C: Well he was the guy {disfmarker} the guy that was using {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: you mean when was {disfmarker} was Mark Randolph there , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: Mark Randolph .\nProfessor A: Yeah he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's at Motorola now .\nPhD B: Oh is he ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know {disfmarker} I just remember it had to do with you know {vocalsound} uh positional parameters\nPhD C: What {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD B: and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So the only {disfmarker} the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {vocalsound} continuous variables and a bunch of them . And so\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there {disfmarker} What you really want are these binary {pause} labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas um {vocalsound} if you did something instead that {disfmarker} like um having some manual annotation by {vocalsound} uh you know , linguistics students , this would {disfmarker} there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with {disfmarker} with John before\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And then there would {disfmarker} it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable . Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables . So . I mean the other thing you could do is {vocalsound} boot trying to {disfmarker} to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from {vocalsound} uh the uh {vocalsound} uh the data itself there , but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Could you cluster the {disfmarker} just do some kind of clustering ?\nProfessor A: Guess you could , yeah .\nPhD B: Bin them up into different categories and {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Yeah . So anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} I mean in general it 's gonna be {disfmarker} for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to {vocalsound} wear the pellets and {disfmarker} Um . So .\nGrad E: Right . Right .\nPhD B: So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD B: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the true mappings are for each phone ?\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: I see .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in {disfmarker} in my mind , I guess , is that um {vocalsound} we 're looking at different ways that we can combine {vocalsound} uh different kinds of {disfmarker} of rep front - end representations {vocalsound} um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from {vocalsound} uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have {vocalsound} a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that {vocalsound} to change some of the other methods we have , since {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that {disfmarker} that it {disfmarker} it um {disfmarker} the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a {disfmarker} a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than {vocalsound} um just assuming {vocalsound} that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength {vocalsound} towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it {disfmarker} so um {vocalsound} he 's got these um uh uh\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: he \" AND 's \" between these different {vocalsound} features . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in {disfmarker} in principle {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different {disfmarker} soft \" OR 's \" across the different uh {vocalsound} multi - band channels . And um {vocalsound} the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" {disfmarker} \" AND ' ed \" things {vocalsound} is something that 's kept {vocalsound} uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is {disfmarker} is uh {vocalsound} taking {vocalsound} the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nPhD B: So he doesn't have {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: which means that it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's uh i It could be for instance {vocalsound} that for a particular point in the data {vocalsound} you don't want to um uh train a particular band {disfmarker} train the detectors for a particular band . You {disfmarker} you wanna ignore {vocalsound} that band , cuz that 's a {disfmarker} Ban - band is a noisy {disfmarker} noisy measure .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And we don't {disfmarker} We 're {disfmarker} we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well {disfmarker} well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .\nPhD B: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or {disfmarker} Ho\nGrad E: F right , and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels .\nProfessor A: Well at the {disfmarker} at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's {disfmarker} where it 's sonorant . But he 's {disfmarker} but what he 's - but what he 's not training up {disfmarker} uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\nGrad E: Right . For the full band .\nProfessor A: um I guess one way of describing would be if {disfmarker} if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ?\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor A: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . OK .\nProfessor A: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band {vocalsound} towards making your decision . And um {vocalsound} uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should {disfmarker} you should use everything {vocalsound} uh with {disfmarker} with uh equal strength .\nPhD B: I see .\nProfessor A: And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had {vocalsound} uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the {disfmarker} if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from {disfmarker} from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: So where did he get his {disfmarker} uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ?\nGrad E: From uh canonical mappings {comment} um at first\nPhD B: OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: and then it 's unclear um eh\nPhD B: Using TIMIT ? or using {disfmarker}\nGrad E: using TIMIT\nPhD B: Uh - huh .\nGrad E: right , right .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah . I mean we ha we have a kind of {vocalsound} iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this {disfmarker} cuz then whatever {vocalsound} that alignment is , it 's that for all {disfmarker} all bands .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate {disfmarker} tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . Um . But it 's still {vocalsound} not quite the same because then it 's {disfmarker} it 's um setting targets based on where you would say {vocalsound} the sound begins in a particular band . Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . Might be closer I guess if we did a {vocalsound} soft {disfmarker} soft target uh {vocalsound} uh embedded {vocalsound} neural net training like we 've done a few times uh {vocalsound} f the forward um {disfmarker} do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . Mmm . Uh what 's next ?\nPhD B: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with .\nProfessor A: Oh . You 're playing ?\nPhD B: I um Huh ?\nProfessor A: You 're playing ?\nPhD B: Yes , I 'm playing . Um {vocalsound} so I wanted to do this experiment to see um {vocalsound} uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um {disfmarker} I think I sent around last week a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where {vocalsound} I would take the um {disfmarker} the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for {vocalsound} the ICSI - OGI front - end .\nProfessor A: What {disfmarker} which test set was this ?\nPhD B: This is {disfmarker} that I looked at ?\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh {vocalsound} been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK {vocalsound} system for the Italian data and got the same results that um {disfmarker} that uh {vocalsound} Stephane had . So um I started looking {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} and now I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to {disfmarker} uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use {vocalsound} the same number of states for all of the models\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a {disfmarker} an HMM system is that you use {vocalsound} um three states per phone and um {vocalsound} so then the {disfmarker} the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . {vocalsound} Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use {vocalsound} uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five {vocalsound} which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} but for the {disfmarker} most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So {vocalsound} my guess {disfmarker} uh And then if you {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I printed out a confusion matrix um {vocalsound} uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that {vocalsound} you know , if you assume a fixed {disfmarker} the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh you 've got {disfmarker} you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So {vocalsound} it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's {disfmarker} because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific {vocalsound} um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the {disfmarker} for the longer word ,\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but .\nPhD B: Yeah so I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create {vocalsound} uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um {disfmarker} how these models were coming out , you know , what w {vocalsound} when we train up uh th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the {disfmarker} uh what do the transition probabilities look like {disfmarker} in the self - loops , {comment} look like in {disfmarker} in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can {vocalsound} calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did {disfmarker} quickly , I did the silence model and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the {vocalsound} string of digits .\nProfessor A: Wow . Lots of silence .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I {disfmarker} I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically {disfmarker} their {disfmarker} {vocalsound} their model for a whole digit string is silence {vocalsound} digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so .\nProfessor A: Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ?\nPhD B: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD B: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own {disfmarker} um It doesn't require its own training data ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: it just shares that state .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know {vocalsound} how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the {disfmarker} the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of {disfmarker} just from looking at the {vocalsound} durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about clustering?\nAnswer:", "input": "What did the professor think about clustering?", "context": "Professor A:  Am I on ? I guess so . Radio two . Hmm . Radio two .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: Wow .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Hi ?\nPhD B: Blow into it , it works really well .\nGrad F: Channel B .\nProfessor A: People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .\nPhD D: Channel four . Test .\nPhD C: Uh - oh .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD C: Radio four .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: So everybody everybody 's on ?\nPhD D: Today 's\nProfessor A: Yeah . So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfmarker} and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that {vocalsound} you were sort of waiting for them to {vocalsound} tell you that they had something for you and {disfmarker} and that {disfmarker} and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: and {vocalsound} they were sort of waiting for you and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh we ended up with this thing where they {disfmarker} they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that . So . Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean it 's true that maybe {disfmarker} maybe no one really thought about that {disfmarker} that this latency thing would be such a {disfmarker} a strict issue\nPhD C: Yeah . Well , but . Yeah . Yeah . Well {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker} the other {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's also so uh the time constraints . Because , {vocalsound} well , we discussed about that {disfmarker} about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and\nProfessor A: Then they couldn't . I see .\nPhD C: uh yeah . But there was also problem {disfmarker} perhaps a problem of communication . So , yeah . Now we will try to {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Just talk more .\nPhD C: Yeah , slikes and send mails .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: u s o o Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh . OK .\nProfessor A: So there 's um {disfmarker} Alright . Well maybe we should just uh I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the {disfmarker} all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this {disfmarker} machines are busy and {vocalsound} you 're busy\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: and\nPhD C: Basically .\nProfessor A: Yeah . OK . Oh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Let 's {disfmarker} let 's , I mean , I think that as {disfmarker} as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there {disfmarker} there will be {vocalsound} uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that {vocalsound} it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's {vocalsound} approach or something and {vocalsound} in addition to {disfmarker} They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ?\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . So yeah we 're {disfmarker} will start to do this also .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson {disfmarker} Ericsson code .\nPhD D: Yeah . We modif\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And\nPhD D: Yeah , I modified it {disfmarker} well , modifying {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . and we have some {disfmarker} the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: But we haven't result until this moment .\nProfessor A: Yeah , sure .\nPhD D: But well , we are working in this also\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD D: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that it 's in process or that you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it finished and it didn't get a good result ?\nPhD D: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature {disfmarker} the feature but the experiment have\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD D: we have not make the experiment\nProfessor A: Oh . OK .\nPhD D: and maybe will be good result or bad result , we don't know .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK . So um I suggest actually now we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sorta move on and {disfmarker} and hear what 's {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening in {disfmarker} in other areas like {vocalsound} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening with your {vocalsound} investigations {vocalsound} about echos and so on .\nGrad F: Oh um Well um I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Uh {vocalsound} I also um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for {disfmarker} for the {disfmarker} for his code yet . Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and {vocalsound} I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it sounded like um {vocalsound} the channel normalization part {vocalsound} um of his thesis um {vocalsound} was done in a {disfmarker} a bit of I don't know what the word is , a {disfmarker} a bit of a rough way um {vocalsound} it sounded like he um he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was {vocalsound} interesting for the test situation but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it 's {vocalsound} what I 'd wanna use so I have to {disfmarker} I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet .\nProfessor A: OK . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again ,\nPhD D: It 's my\nPhD C: Oh yeah ?\nPhD D: I know this is mine here .\nProfessor A: so . OK . Um . {vocalsound} The um {disfmarker} so you , and then {vocalsound} you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the {disfmarker} the close mounted and the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts between the distant {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Uh I I 'm ho Right . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or I 'm hoping {disfmarker} I 'm hoping Espen will do it .\nProfessor A: Ah ! OK .\nGrad F: Um\nProfessor A: F um\nGrad F: u\nProfessor A: Delegate . That 's good . It 's good to delegate .\nGrad F: I {disfmarker} I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it .\nProfessor A: Great . Great . Yeah actually um he should uh I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . Um . {vocalsound} One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner {vocalsound} close - miked recordings . So uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close {disfmarker} close - miked uh cases um we 'd like to be able to have {vocalsound} um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from {disfmarker} So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be {disfmarker} So {vocalsound} what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but {vocalsound} uh just um uh taking the input from other mikes and using uh {vocalsound} uh a uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . So . Um what was it , there was {disfmarker} there was some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some point where {vocalsound} eh uh Eric or somebody was {disfmarker} was speaking and he had lots of {vocalsound} silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh {vocalsound} which was in the background and it was not {disfmarker} it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech {vocalsound} on the close {disfmarker} {vocalsound} close mike .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD B: Oh the {disfmarker} What we talked about yesterday ?\nProfessor A: Yes .\nPhD B: Yeah that was actually my {disfmarker} I was wearing the {disfmarker} I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,\nProfessor A: Oh you {disfmarker} it was you I was Yeah .\nPhD B: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that {disfmarker} mmm uh {disfmarker} that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out . So I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that . So . OK . Right ? Um . {vocalsound} And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the {disfmarker} the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but {vocalsound} maybe just a quick reprise of {disfmarker} of what we were saying this morning .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor A: Uh .\nGrad E: Um . {comment} So continuing to um extend\nPhD B: What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? And {disfmarker} and S Shawn , yeah . Oh . So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? I see .\nProfessor A: But that 's uh uh all {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} is a {disfmarker} a certainly relevant {comment} {vocalsound} uh study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . We have this problem with the overloading of the term \" feature \" so\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: uh {vocalsound} what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found {disfmarker} finding useful\nPhD C: Hmm .\nProfessor A: um for {disfmarker}\nPhD B: And their {disfmarker} their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features .\nProfessor A: Right . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nGrad E: Oh yeah .\nProfessor A: There 's those {vocalsound} {pause} that uh yeah , some of {disfmarker} some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on {disfmarker} on uh {vocalsound} what \" good features \" are and {disfmarker}\nPhD B: What does {disfmarker} what did um Larry Saul use for {disfmarker} it was the sonorant uh detector , right ? How did he {disfmarker} H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . So how did he combine all these features ? What {disfmarker} what r mmm classifier did he Hmm . Oh right . You were talking about that , yeah . I see .\nProfessor A: And the other thing you were talking about is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is where we get the targets from . So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the {disfmarker} what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels {vocalsound} from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this {disfmarker} this database ? This is the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Hmm !\nProfessor A: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah .\nPhD B: Pierced tongues and Yeah . You could just mount it to that and they wouldn't even notice . Weld it . Zzz .\nProfessor A: Maybe you could go to these parlors and {disfmarker} and you could , you know {disfmarker} you know have {disfmarker} have , you know , reduced rates if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you can do the measurements .\nPhD B: Yeah . I That 's right . You could {disfmarker} what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah , be cool and help science .\nPhD B: and Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD B: Hmm ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that {disfmarker} people have done studies like that w way way back right ? I mean {vocalsound} I can't remember where {disfmarker} uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of {disfmarker} Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ? Um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . I can't remember what his name was . Dang . Now I 'll think of it . That 's interesting .\nProfessor A: Do you mean eh {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} Mar\nPhD C: Well he was the guy {disfmarker} the guy that was using {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: you mean when was {disfmarker} was Mark Randolph there , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: Mark Randolph .\nProfessor A: Yeah he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's at Motorola now .\nPhD B: Oh is he ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know {disfmarker} I just remember it had to do with you know {vocalsound} uh positional parameters\nPhD C: What {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD B: and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So the only {disfmarker} the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {vocalsound} continuous variables and a bunch of them . And so\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there {disfmarker} What you really want are these binary {pause} labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas um {vocalsound} if you did something instead that {disfmarker} like um having some manual annotation by {vocalsound} uh you know , linguistics students , this would {disfmarker} there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with {disfmarker} with John before\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And then there would {disfmarker} it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable . Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables . So . I mean the other thing you could do is {vocalsound} boot trying to {disfmarker} to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from {vocalsound} uh the uh {vocalsound} uh the data itself there , but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Could you cluster the {disfmarker} just do some kind of clustering ?\nProfessor A: Guess you could , yeah .\nPhD B: Bin them up into different categories and {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Yeah . So anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} I mean in general it 's gonna be {disfmarker} for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to {vocalsound} wear the pellets and {disfmarker} Um . So .\nGrad E: Right . Right .\nPhD B: So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD B: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the true mappings are for each phone ?\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: I see .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in {disfmarker} in my mind , I guess , is that um {vocalsound} we 're looking at different ways that we can combine {vocalsound} uh different kinds of {disfmarker} of rep front - end representations {vocalsound} um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from {vocalsound} uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have {vocalsound} a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that {vocalsound} to change some of the other methods we have , since {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that {disfmarker} that it {disfmarker} it um {disfmarker} the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a {disfmarker} a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than {vocalsound} um just assuming {vocalsound} that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength {vocalsound} towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it {disfmarker} so um {vocalsound} he 's got these um uh uh\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: he \" AND 's \" between these different {vocalsound} features . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in {disfmarker} in principle {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different {disfmarker} soft \" OR 's \" across the different uh {vocalsound} multi - band channels . And um {vocalsound} the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" {disfmarker} \" AND ' ed \" things {vocalsound} is something that 's kept {vocalsound} uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is {disfmarker} is uh {vocalsound} taking {vocalsound} the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nPhD B: So he doesn't have {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: which means that it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's uh i It could be for instance {vocalsound} that for a particular point in the data {vocalsound} you don't want to um uh train a particular band {disfmarker} train the detectors for a particular band . You {disfmarker} you wanna ignore {vocalsound} that band , cuz that 's a {disfmarker} Ban - band is a noisy {disfmarker} noisy measure .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And we don't {disfmarker} We 're {disfmarker} we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well {disfmarker} well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .\nPhD B: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or {disfmarker} Ho\nGrad E: F right , and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels .\nProfessor A: Well at the {disfmarker} at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's {disfmarker} where it 's sonorant . But he 's {disfmarker} but what he 's - but what he 's not training up {disfmarker} uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\nGrad E: Right . For the full band .\nProfessor A: um I guess one way of describing would be if {disfmarker} if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ?\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor A: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . OK .\nProfessor A: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band {vocalsound} towards making your decision . And um {vocalsound} uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should {disfmarker} you should use everything {vocalsound} uh with {disfmarker} with uh equal strength .\nPhD B: I see .\nProfessor A: And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had {vocalsound} uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the {disfmarker} if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from {disfmarker} from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: So where did he get his {disfmarker} uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ?\nGrad E: From uh canonical mappings {comment} um at first\nPhD B: OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: and then it 's unclear um eh\nPhD B: Using TIMIT ? or using {disfmarker}\nGrad E: using TIMIT\nPhD B: Uh - huh .\nGrad E: right , right .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah . I mean we ha we have a kind of {vocalsound} iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this {disfmarker} cuz then whatever {vocalsound} that alignment is , it 's that for all {disfmarker} all bands .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate {disfmarker} tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . Um . But it 's still {vocalsound} not quite the same because then it 's {disfmarker} it 's um setting targets based on where you would say {vocalsound} the sound begins in a particular band . Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . Might be closer I guess if we did a {vocalsound} soft {disfmarker} soft target uh {vocalsound} uh embedded {vocalsound} neural net training like we 've done a few times uh {vocalsound} f the forward um {disfmarker} do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . Mmm . Uh what 's next ?\nPhD B: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with .\nProfessor A: Oh . You 're playing ?\nPhD B: I um Huh ?\nProfessor A: You 're playing ?\nPhD B: Yes , I 'm playing . Um {vocalsound} so I wanted to do this experiment to see um {vocalsound} uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um {disfmarker} I think I sent around last week a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where {vocalsound} I would take the um {disfmarker} the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for {vocalsound} the ICSI - OGI front - end .\nProfessor A: What {disfmarker} which test set was this ?\nPhD B: This is {disfmarker} that I looked at ?\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh {vocalsound} been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK {vocalsound} system for the Italian data and got the same results that um {disfmarker} that uh {vocalsound} Stephane had . So um I started looking {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} and now I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to {disfmarker} uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use {vocalsound} the same number of states for all of the models\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a {disfmarker} an HMM system is that you use {vocalsound} um three states per phone and um {vocalsound} so then the {disfmarker} the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . {vocalsound} Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use {vocalsound} uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five {vocalsound} which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} but for the {disfmarker} most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So {vocalsound} my guess {disfmarker} uh And then if you {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I printed out a confusion matrix um {vocalsound} uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that {vocalsound} you know , if you assume a fixed {disfmarker} the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh you 've got {disfmarker} you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So {vocalsound} it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's {disfmarker} because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific {vocalsound} um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the {disfmarker} for the longer word ,\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but .\nPhD B: Yeah so I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create {vocalsound} uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um {disfmarker} how these models were coming out , you know , what w {vocalsound} when we train up uh th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the {disfmarker} uh what do the transition probabilities look like {disfmarker} in the self - loops , {comment} look like in {disfmarker} in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can {vocalsound} calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did {disfmarker} quickly , I did the silence model and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the {vocalsound} string of digits .\nProfessor A: Wow . Lots of silence .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I {disfmarker} I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically {disfmarker} their {disfmarker} {vocalsound} their model for a whole digit string is silence {vocalsound} digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so .\nProfessor A: Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ?\nPhD B: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD B: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own {disfmarker} um It doesn't require its own training data ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: it just shares that state .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know {vocalsound} how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the {disfmarker} the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of {disfmarker} just from looking at the {vocalsound} durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .", "answers": ["The professor was not too excited about clustering.
