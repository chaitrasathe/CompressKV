The Occupy Los Angeles encampment at City Hall Park is seen before the midnight deadline for eviction from City Hall Park passes in Los Angeles, November 27, 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Police in riot gear closed in before dawn on Monday on anti-Wall Street activists in Los Angeles who defied a midnight deadline to vacate a camp outside City Hall, but stopped short of clearing the encampment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police managed to reopen blocked streets for morning rush-hour commuters after a tense standoff with protesters who had taken over a downtown intersection, but remnants of a crowd that had swelled to 2,000 overnight remained at City Hall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four demonstrators were arrested during the brief confrontation, accused of being present at an unlawful assembly, before police ultimately pulled back from City Hall park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later, attorneys for Occupy LA asked a federal judge for an injunction barring police from evicting the camp, arguing that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and police chief Charlie Beck had violated their civil rights by ordering it dismantled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Los Angeles encampment, which officials had tolerated for weeks even as other cities moved in to clear out similar camps, is among the largest on the West Coast aligned with a 2-month-old national Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Villaraigosa eventually gave protesters until just after midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal, setting the stage for the latest showdown between leaders of a major U.S. city and the Occupy movement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But about two hours after the eviction deadline had passed, police commanders said they would permit the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak. Police Commander Andrew Smith later said he thought it was \"highly unlikely\" that the camp would be forced to shut down on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elsewhere in the country, a 5 p.m. Sunday deadline set by Philadelphia officials for Occupy protesters there to move from a similar encampment came and went without incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dozens of people heeded the order but many tents and other structures stayed put. Police sources said authorities were hoping the rest of the protesters would relocate voluntarily and that no major actions were expected before Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WHOSE STREET? OUR STREET!' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Staking its place since October 1 on the grounds surrounding City Hall, the Los Angeles camp had grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, organizers and municipal officials said. At least a third of campers were believed to be homeless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Sunday night the size of the crowd outside City Hall swelled further as supporters from organized labor, clergy, civil rights and other groups streamed into the area, answering a call for an 11th-hour show of support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The overall number of protesters, some wearing gas masks, had grown to at least 2,000 by late Sunday, police estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After keeping out of sight throughout the day on Sunday, police began to make their presence known as the mayor's eviction deadline passed, and the protesters' mood turned from calm and festive to rowdy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Demonstrators and police confronted each other overnight but except for some debris thrown by protesters at one point, there was no violence. One skirmish involved an intersection occupied by protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Minutes after ordering protesters in the street to disperse, dozens of helmeted police carrying night sticks and special shotguns for firing \"bean-bag\" projectiles enclosed the intersection and forced their way into the crowd. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most in the crowd quickly retreated into the park, as onlookers chanted \"Whose street? Our Street\" at police and shouted at those defying police to \"Get off the street!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Someone hurled what appeared to be pieces of a bamboo pole and a bottle at police, and Smith said four people were arrested. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Los Angeles has been relatively accommodating to its Occupy group compared to other major cities, with Villaraigosa at one point providing ponchos to campers when it rained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But after the collapse of negotiations aimed at persuading protesters to relocate voluntarily, the mayor said last week the encampment would have to go. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mayor complimented the protesters on Sunday for staying peaceful. But he added in a statement: \"It is time for Occupy LA to move from focusing their efforts to hold a particular patch of park land to spreading the message of economic justice and restoration of balance to American society.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he hoped to avoid the sporadic violence that erupted in other cities when police used force against Occupy protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A number of protesters early on Monday credited the police with showing restraint, including Clark Davis, an Occupy LA organizer, who said to Smith and a group of other officers standing by, \"You guys have been fantastic.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Writing by Steve Gorman and Dan Whitcomb; Additional reporting by Lucy Nicholson and Dave Warner in Philadelphia; Editing by Greg McCune and Cynthia Johnston)\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nMembers of Occupy Philadelphia remain on site at City Hall into the evening of Nov. 28.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.\nPassage 2:\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kalashnikov designed the AK-47 after being wounded fighting for the Red Army NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The inventor of the Kalashnikov assault rifle apparently wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church before he died expressing fears he was morally responsible for the people it killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died last month aged 94, wrote a long emotional letter to Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Devilish desires' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis The letter published by Izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created Russia's most famous weapon. Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine. It's unclear, though, how much of this he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a letter, published in Russia's pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, he wrote: \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths?\" he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The longer I live,\" he continued, \"the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter is typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, and is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kalashnikov, or AK-47, is one of the world's most familiar and widely used weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is thought that more than 100 million Kalashnikov rifles have been sold worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov refused to accept responsibility for the many people killed by his weapon, blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin attended Kalashnikov's funeral in December NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, pride in his invention was tempered with sadness at its use by criminals and child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is painful for me to see when criminal elements of all kinds fire from my weapon,\" Kalashnikov said in 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia Cyril Alexander Volkov, Press secretary for Russian Patriarch Kirill NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defend his country NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his letter to Patriarch Kirill, Kalashnikov said that he first went into a church at the age of 91 and was later baptised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says it is unclear how much of it he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The press secretary for the Russian Patriarch, Cyril Alexander Volkov, told the paper the religious leader had received Kalashnikov's letter and had written a reply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,\" Mr Volkov was quoted as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov received many Russian state honours, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour, but made little money from his gun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He died on 23 December after being admitted to hospital a month earlier with internal bleeding.\nPassage 3:\nIn this Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2009 file photo Mikhail Kalashnikov, who invented the AK-47 assault rifle, attends festivities to celebrate his 90th birthday at the Kremlin in Moscow. (AP Photo/Natalia Kolesnikova, Pool, file) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, designer of the legendary AK-47 assault rifle, turned to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church shortly before his death to express fears he was personally guilty for those it killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov, who died in December at the age of 94, in April wrote a lengthy emotional letter to Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill, Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, reported on Monday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died last month aged 94, wrote a long emotional letter to Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Devilish desires' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis The letter published by Izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created Russia's most famous weapon. Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine. It's unclear, though, how much of this he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a letter, published in Russia's pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, he wrote: \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths?\" he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The longer I live,\" he continued, \"the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter is typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, and is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kalashnikov, or AK-47, is one of the world's most familiar and widely used weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is thought that more than 100 million Kalashnikov rifles have been sold worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov refused to accept responsibility for the many people killed by his weapon, blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin attended Kalashnikov's funeral in December NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, pride in his invention was tempered with sadness at its use by criminals and child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is painful for me to see when criminal elements of all kinds fire from my weapon,\" Kalashnikov said in 2008.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says it is unclear how much of it he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The press secretary for the Russian Patriarch, Cyril Alexander Volkov, told the paper the religious leader had received Kalashnikov's letter and had written a reply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,\" Mr Volkov was quoted as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov received many Russian state honours, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour, but made little money from his gun.

(AP Photo/Natalia Kolesnikova, Pool, file) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, designer of the legendary AK-47 assault rifle, turned to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church shortly before his death to express fears he was personally guilty for those it killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov, who died in December at the age of 94, in April wrote a lengthy emotional letter to Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill, Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, reported on Monday.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply\u2014one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "pred": " Write a one-page summary of all the news.

Hernandez, 39, was shot... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would be 33 minutes before Transportation Security Administration Officer Gerardo Hernandez, who was about 20 feet from an exit, would be wheeled out by police to an ambulance, said the officials, who were briefed on the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe was still ongoing into the Nov. 1 shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all but five of those minutes, there was no threat from the suspected gunman _ he had been shot and was in custody, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it's not known when Hernandez died or if immediate medical attention could have saved his life, officials are examining what conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier, one of the officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Formal conclusions may take months to reach, but what's known raises the possibility that a lack of coordination between police and fire officials prevented speedy treatment for Hernandez and other victims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TSA workers at LAX have been wondering the same thing, said Victor Payes, who works at the airport and is president of the local union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that shouldn't have happened,\" Payes said. \"We may be talking about Officer Hernandez as a survivor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives for the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Los Angeles Airport Police said they couldn't comment on the ongoing investigation until extensive reports are finished.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say that Paul Ciancia entered Terminal 3 with a duffel bag, pulled out an assault rifle and started shooting. They said he had a note in his bag that said he wanted to \"kill TSA\" and that he wanted to stir fear in them, criticizing their searches as unconstitutional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was shot by airport police officers four times, in the mouth and leg, before being taken into custody. He remains in fair condition at a hospital and his doctors will determine when he's fit to appear in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the chaotic moments after the gunfire began, as travelers dove to the ground or scrambled for cover in restaurants and stores, officials worried there could be bombs in the terminal and tried to determine whether the gunman had any accomplices. In the first 30 minutes, there was also an unfounded report of two suspicious people on an adjacent parking garage roof, one of the officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officers from multiple agencies bent down to check on Hernandez before moving on, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police broadcast over their radios that Ciancia was in custody at 9:25 a.m., five minutes after Hernandez was shot in the chest.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's unclear whether the officer was qualified to determine Hernandez was dead. No officers rendered first aid on scene, according to surveillance video reviewed by the officials. Finally, airport police put Hernandez in a wheelchair and ran him to an ambulance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trauma surgeon David Plurad said Hernandez had no signs of life when he arrived at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Doctors worked for about an hour to revive him despite significant blood loss.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers is seeking to recover about $973,000 in costs from a high profile gender discrimination trial that captivated Silicon Valley, according to a court filing on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ellen Pao leaves San Francisco Superior Court Civic Center Courthouse during a lunch break in San Francisco, California March 25, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A jury cleared Kleiner Perkins in March of claims it short-circuited former partner Ellen Pao\u2019s career because she is a woman. The trial helped spark a wide discussion about gender at the center of the U.S. technology industry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner has offered to waive its legal costs should Pao choose not to appeal, according to firm spokeswoman Christina Lee. Kleiner\u2019s costs request includes about $865,000 in expert witness fees, the court filing said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation,\u201d Lee said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao and her legal team are considering the proposal, said Heather Wilson, a spokeswoman for Pao. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao, now interim chief executive at social-news service Reddit, claimed her standing at Kleiner Perkins crumbled after she ended a brief affair with a partner. Her career deteriorated after he and Kleiner Perkins started retaliating against her in a climate that was overall unfriendly toward women, her lawyers argued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the verdict, three jurors told Reuters they had focused on Pao\u2019s increasingly negative performance reviews, which undermined her argument that she deserved to be promoted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner\u2019s offer to withdraw its costs request in exchange for an end to the case, is common when defendants prevail in employment lawsuits. Should Pao decide to pursue an appeal, her case would be heard by California\u2019s First District Court of Appeal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Westlaw data, out of 49 decisions involving discrimination and retaliation over the past two years, the First District affirmed 26 of 31 cases where the employer won in the trial court, or 84 percent. Only five cases were reversed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile the court, which covers San Francisco and 11 other Northern California counties, handed victory to employers in more than half of the cases they lost in the lower courts, reversing 10 of 18 cases.\nPassage 2:\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm, is offering a new deal to the former associate who unsuccessfully sued the firm, accusing it of gender discrimination: Promise not to pursue this case any further or pay us $1 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The offer was made in papers filed this week in California Superior Court in San Francisco. The firm said the case, which drew an abundance of unfavorable attention to its inner workings and the fate of women in Silicon Valley, cost it $972,815 in witness fees, deposition and court reporter costs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the winning party, Kleiner is asking the former associate, Ellen Pao, to reimburse it for these bills.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner has offered to waive its legal costs should Pao choose not to appeal, according to firm spokeswoman Christina Lee.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Westlaw data, out of 49 decisions involving discrimination and retaliation over the past two years, the First District affirmed 26 of 31 cases where the employer won in the trial court, or 84 percent.

The firm said the case, which drew an abundance of unfavorable attention to its inner workings and the fate of women in Silicon Valley, cost it $972,815 in witness fees, deposition and court reporter costs.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack McCullough, 76, was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the judge's ruling, McCullough turned toward his stepdaughter, Janey O'Connor, and flashed her a private signal that she says means \"I love you.\" She was seated behind him and broke into tears but managed a big smile back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria Ridulph's murder went unsolved for half a century. Then detectives pursued a tip, and a man was brought to trial and convicted in the 1957 murder of the 7-year-old in Sycamore, Illinois. Now that man is free. Ann O'Neill's 2013 series on the case, \"Taken,\" raised questions about whether the trial was unfairly one-sided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across the aisle, Charles Ridulph, the older brother of the victim, frowned and bowed his head. More than 58 years ago, he helped search for Maria after she vanished from a street corner near their home while playing in the snow with a friend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough has long insisted that he couldn't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He repeated the alibi when he spoke with CNN in prison in March 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They proved nothing,\" he said at the time. \"I am in here for murder. A murder I would not, could not have done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough said that when Maria was kidnapped, the telephone in his home in Sycamore was ringing.

Only Scotty could make that happen, if he beamed me up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack McCullough, in prison after his 2012 conviction. Now a judge has ordered him freed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Illinois appeals court upheld his conviction last year. But McCullough made a last-ditch appeal in a jailhouse motion last December, saying police and prosecutors buried evidence supporting his alibi. He asked a judge to find him innocent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who inherited the case from predecessor Clay Campbell, was placed in the position of having to defend the conviction. He launched a six-month investigation that included a review of some 4,500 pages of documents -- old police and FBI reports, grand jury transcripts, trial transcripts, affidavits for search and arrest warrants, and even CNN's five-part series on the case, \"Taken,\" which raised questions about whether the courtroom reconstruction of history was unfairly one-sided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack concluded that he'd found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough had been convicted of a crime he didn't commit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The precise time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning.

MUST WATCH Taken: The coldest case ever solved 02:18 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dark-haired second-grader with big brown eyes was with her playmate, Kathy Sigman, on December 3, 1957 when they were approached by a stranger who said his name was Johnny. He gave Maria two piggyback rides, Sigman told police at the time. Sigman, now a grandmother known as Kathy Chapman, said she went home to fetch her mittens. When she returned, Maria and Johnny were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 600 volunteers combed the fields and woods around Sycamore in search of Maria, at times walking hand-in-hand in a grid pattern. And within 24 hours, dozens of FBI agents descended on the small farming community about 65 miles west of Chicago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Agents interviewed some 200 possible suspects -- including McCullough, who passed a polygraph test about his alibi and was cleared. Despite the work of nearly three-dozen FBI agents, the investigation turned up no solid leads to Maria's whereabouts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her body was discovered 144 days later by a couple looking for mushrooms near the Iowa border. She was under a fallen tree, some 100 miles from home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because Maria apparently never left Illinois, the FBI pulled out of the investigation and the case went cold for half a century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Illinois State Police began to look into the Ridulph case again in 2008, after McCullough's half sister, Janet Tessier, emailed a tip. She said her dying mother had pulled her close some 14 years earlier and whispered, \"Those two little girls, and the one that disappeared, John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough was questioned in Seattle and arrested in late June 2011. A judge hearing the case without a jury found McCullough guilty after a week-long trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, the state's attorney, said he sat through the trial and always doubted whether there was enough evidence to support the conviction. In his review of the case, he said he found new evidence that verified McCullough's long-standing alibi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He subpoenaed records from AT&T and found that a collect call had indeed been placed at 6:57 p.m. to McCullough's home in Sycamore from a pay phone at the post office in downtown Rockford on on December 3, 1957 -- just as McCullough said he had done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At his sentencing, McCullough vehemently professed his innocence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Look in the box. The truth is in the box,\" he said, pointing to a cardboard box in the courtroom. It was filled with old FBI reports and other documents that the judge, James Hallock, kept from the trial, saying it was inadmissible hearsay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutor Richard Schmack reviewed the case and asked for McCullough to go free. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack did look at those documents. He built a timeline based on the statements of 21 people -- Maria Ridulph's family members, friends, neighbors and passersby -- that confirmed the FBI's original timeline ruling out McCullough as a suspect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria was taken that day some time between 6:45 and 7 p.m. -- and not as early as 6 p.m., as alleged during McCullough's trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would have been impossible for him to have been in two places at once. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Campbell, the state's attorney who brought the case, was defeated by Schmack in an election just weeks after McCullough was convicted. Campbell has declined to comment since Schmack released his findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cold cases are particularly difficult to prosecute because evidence is often lost or destroyed, memories fade and witnesses die. And so questions have lingered over the evidence used to convict McCullough -- and whether it was strong enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No physical evidence ties him to the crime.\nPassage 2:\nSYCAMORE, Ill. --A 76-year-old man from Washington state who a prosecutor says was wrongly convicted in the abduction and killing of a 7-year-old Illinois schoolgirl in 1957 will be released from prison, a judge ordered Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WATCH: \"48 Hours:\" Cold as Ice NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing, presided over by Judge William P. Brady, was held in Sycamore, about 70 miles west of Chicago and near where Maria Ridulph was abducted as she played in the snow. Forest hikers found the girl's remains five months later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012, another judge convicted Jack McCullough in Maria's death, in one of the oldest unsolved U.S. cases ever to go to trial. McCullough was sentenced to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough, in handcuffs, appeared shaken by the judge's decision at first, rocking back and forth, then taking a deep breath. Family members behind him hugged and cried. Moments later, McCullough looked back and smiled broadly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the other side of the room, Maria's brother and sister displayed little emotion as the hearing ended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady said McCullough would be released Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge pointed to several factors in his decision, including records that support McCullough's long-held contention that he was about 40 miles away from Sycamore when Maria was abducted. That evidence included newly discovered phone records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn't clear until the last minute the Brady would rule as he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Rest assured I am not trying this case ... You will not hear the words, 'Mr. McCullough is guilty' or 'Mr. McCullough is not guilty' coming from my mouth.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady's ruling was prompted by a six-month review of evidence conducted by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack after the 2012 conviction. Schmack concluded that McCullough could not have killed Maria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's disappearance made headlines nationwide in the 1950s, when reports of child abductions were rare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had been playing outside in the snow with a friend on Dec. 3, 1957, when a young man approached, introduced himself as \"Johnny\" and offered them piggyback rides. Maria's friend dashed home to grab mittens, and when she came back, Maria and the man were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At trial, prosecutors said McCullough was Johnny, because he went by John Tessier in his youth. They said McCullough, then 18, dragged Maria away, choked and stabbed her to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who wasn't involved in McCullough's case and was elected to the state's attorney post as McCullough's trial came to an end, filed a scathing report with the court last month that appeared to pick the case apart, point-by-point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's long-held alibi was that he was in Rockford, attempting to enlist with the U.S. Air Force at a military recruiting station, on the night Maria disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack said newly discovered phone records proved McCullough had, as he long-claimed, made a collect call to his parents at 6:57 p.m. from a phone booth in downtown Rockford - which is 40 miles northwest of where Maria was abducted between 6:45 p.m. and 6:55 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack also reviewed police reports and hundreds of other documents, including from the Air Force recruitment office, which he said had been improperly barred at trial. In his review he said the documents contained \"a wealth of information pointing to McCullough's innocence, and absolutely nothing showing guilt.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also noted that Maria's friend had identified McCullough as the killer five decades later from an array of six photographs; McCullough's picture stood out, partially because everyone but him wore suitcoats and their photos were professional yearbook pictures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's murder haunted the Sycamore for decades, and McCullough's conviction four years ago seemed to bring some closure. Those wounds now threaten to reopen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her family remains convinced that McCullough is guilty and have sought the appointment of a special prosecutor in an attempt to keep him behind bars. Maria's brother, 70-year-old Charles Ridulph, still lives in Sycamore and has said in recent weeks that his family feels let down by the state prosecutor's office about-face.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSycamore, Illinois (CNN) The man convicted in the oldest cold case ever brought to court broke into a wide grin as a judge ordered him released from prison Friday and granted him a new trial.

Campbell has declined to comment since Schmack released his findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cold cases are particularly difficult to prosecute because evidence is often lost or destroyed, memories fade and witnesses die. And so questions have lingered over the evidence used to convict McCullough -- and whether it was strong enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No physical evidence ties him to the crime.\nPassage 2:\nSYCAMORE, Ill. --A 76-year-old man from Washington state who a prosecutor says was wrongly convicted in the abduction and killing of a 7-year-old Illinois schoolgirl in 1957 will be released from prison, a judge ordered Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WATCH: \"48 Hours:\" Cold as Ice NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing, presided over by Judge William P. Brady, was held in Sycamore, about 70 miles west of Chicago and near where Maria Ridulph was abducted as she played in the snow. Forest hikers found the girl's remains five months later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012, another judge convicted Jack McCullough in Maria's death, in one of the oldest unsolved U.S. cases ever to go to trial. McCullough was sentenced to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough, in handcuffs, appeared shaken by the judge's decision at first, rocking back and forth, then taking a deep breath. Family members behind him hugged and cried. Moments later, McCullough looked back and smiled broadly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the other side of the room, Maria's brother and sister displayed little emotion as the hearing ended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady said McCullough would be released Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge pointed to several factors in his decision, including records that support McCullough's long-held contention that he was about 40 miles away from Sycamore when Maria was abducted. That evidence included newly discovered phone records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn't clear until the last minute the Brady would rule as he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Rest assured I am not trying this case ... You will not hear the words, 'Mr. McCullough is guilty' or 'Mr. McCullough is not guilty' coming from my mouth.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady's ruling was prompted by a six-month review of evidence conducted by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack after the 2012 conviction. Schmack concluded that McCullough could not have killed Maria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's disappearance made headlines nationwide in the 1950s, when reports of child abductions were rare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had been playing outside in the snow with a friend on Dec. 3, 1957, when a young man approached, introduced himself as \"Johnny\" and offered them piggyback rides. Maria's friend dashed home to grab mittens, and when she came back, Maria and the man were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At trial, prosecutors said McCullough was Johnny, because he went by John Tessier in his youth. They said McCullough, then 18, dragged Maria away, choked and stabbed her to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who wasn't involved in McCullough's case and was elected to the state's attorney post as McCullough's trial came to an end, filed a scathing report with the court last month that appeared to pick the case apart, point-by-point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's long-held alibi was that he was in Rockford, attempting to enlist with the U.S. Air Force at a military recruiting station, on the night Maria disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack said newly discovered phone records proved McCullough had, as he long-claimed, made a collect call to his parents at 6:57 p.m. from a phone booth in downtown Rockford - which is 40 miles northwest of where Maria was abducted between 6:45 p.m. and 6:55 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack also reviewed police reports and hundreds of other documents, including from the Air Force recruitment office, which he said had been improperly barred at trial. In his review he said the documents contained \"a wealth of information pointing to McCullough's innocence, and absolutely nothing showing guilt.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also noted that Maria's friend had identified McCullough as the killer five decades later from an array of six photographs; McCullough's picture stood out, partially because everyone but him wore suitcoats and their photos were professional yearbook pictures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's murder haunted the Sycamore for decades, and McCullough's conviction four years ago seemed to bring some closure. Those wounds now threaten to reopen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her family remains convinced that McCullough is guilty and have sought the appointment of a special prosecutor in an attempt to keep him behind bars. Maria's brother, 70-year-old Charles Ridulph, still lives in Sycamore and has said in recent weeks that his family feels let down by the state prosecutor's office about-face.\n", "answers": ["A man convicted four years ago in the oldest cold case ever tried was freed Friday after an Illinois judge vacated his conviction and subsequent life sentence, CNN reports. According to CBS News, 76-year-old Jack McCullough was convicted of kidnapping a 7-year-old girl, choking her, and stabbing her to death in 1957. The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent. While the judge Friday vacated McCullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the Chicago Tribune reports. McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents\u2014including phone and Air Force records\u2014supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened. But his was the only non-yearbook photo in the lineup, and she picked a different man out of a photo lineup 50 years earlier. That info wasn't allowed at McCullough's trial either. No physical evidence was ever found to support McCullough's conviction."], "pred": " Write a summary of all the news. Summary: Write a summary of all the news.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nCigarette smoke has long been known to have a multitude of damaging effects, but thanks to recent research we now know it also fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs. According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia. Originating as a strain of staph infection, MRSA becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. A disastrous diagnosis due to its innate difficulty to treat, it has become even more threatening with the addition of smoking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, in a press release. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist, sought to find potential ties between the increased occurrences of MRSA cases in smokers. In order to do so, Crotty Alexander and her team tested two groups of MRSA, one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not, to see how each group responded to the defenses of our immune system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Macrophages, or immune cells known to devour infectious ages, were infected with both types of MRSA (smoke exposed and not) to test the immune response. Although both were able to take up the populations of MRSA, macrophages fighting MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time killing them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers found that this type of MRSA was more resistant to the reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst macrophages utilize once they have engulfed bacteria. MRSA exposed to smoke extract was also more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense used to make holes in bacteria and cause inflammation. Even more alarming was researchers\u2019 discovery that MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, assisting in the success of their invasion. This effect depended strongly on dose; the more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ultimately, the data suggest that through altering the cell walls of the bacteria, cigarette smoke allows MRSA to repel common forms of immune responses. Another study conducted by researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier suggested something similar with e-cigarette smoke; vaporized smoke can also alter the structure of MRSA\u2019s cell wall to make it more resistant to bacteria. However, this research also discovered that surface changes to the bacteria increased 10 times more with exposure to cigarette smoke rather than e-cigarette vapor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Now we have evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor,\" Crotty Alexander said. Through their finding, Crotty Alexander and her team hope to add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract become harder to kill, said Dr. Laura E.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crotty Alexander is senior author of the paper, published Monday in the journal Infection and Immunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study is similar to one published last May, in which the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance was examined.

Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. \u2014 Hayne Palmour IV NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, Crotty Alexander said. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MRSA exposed to the smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, Crotty's team found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worse, the study found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions. At that rate, a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When we put these cigarette smoke-exposed bacteria into mice, there was a significant difference in mortality,\" compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed, Crotty Alexander said in a phone interview Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The smoke-exposed MRSA also became better at invading human cells in lab cultures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The cigarette smoke helped the bacteria kill more mice, whereas the e-cigarette vapor was just on the borderline,\" Crotty Alexander said. \"It did make it a little more aggressive, but not as much as the cigarette smoke.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. \u2014 NIAID Share Photo \uf610 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \uf611 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reddit NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2709 Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. / NIAID NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study stated it was performed to examine an alternative to the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker. The alternative is that smoke actually makes the pathogen tougher. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for that alternative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Because MRSA causes severe pneumonia more often than MSSA, and because MRSA commonly colonizes the nasopharynx and airways and thus is exposed to inhaled substances, we examined the effect of cigarette smoke on MRSA resistance to host innate immune killing mechanisms and the ability to cause pneumonia in mice,\" the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests on human cells found the same result, Crotty Alexander said. Previous research has shown that cigarette smoke harms human respiratory and immune cells, she said.
